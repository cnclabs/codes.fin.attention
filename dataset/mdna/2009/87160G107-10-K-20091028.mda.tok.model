use of estimates and critical accounting policies a description of critical accounting policies including those that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our business the company is a medical device company 
through continuous improvement and development of our people  our mission is to design  manufacture and market innovative microsurgical instruments and consumables of the highest quality in order to assist and enable surgeons who perform microsurgery around the world to provide a better quality of life for their patients 
the company s primary focus is on the microsurgical disciplines of ophthalmology and neurosurgery 
our distribution channels include a combination of direct and independent sales organizations and important strategic alliances with market leaders 
the company s product lines focus upon precision engineered  microsurgical  hand held instruments and the microscopic delivery of laser energy  ultrasound  electrosurgery  aspiration  illumination and irrigation  often delivered in multiple combinations 
enterprise wide information is included in note to the consolidated audited financial statements 
new product sales the company s business strategy has been  and is expected to continue to be  the development  manufacture and marketing of new technologies for microsurgery applications including the ophthalmic and neurosurgical markets 
new products  which management defines as products first available for sale within the prior month period  accounted for approximately percent of total sales for the company for fiscal  or approximately million 
for fiscal  new products accounted for approximately percent of total sales for the company  or approximately million 
this continued growth was primarily in our capital equipment and disposable products both in the ophthalmic and neurosurgical markets 
the company s past revenue growth has been closely aligned with the adoption by surgeons of new technologies introduced by the company 
since august   the company has introduced new catalogue items to the ophthalmic and neurosurgical markets 
we expect adoption rates for the company s new products in the future to have a positive effect on its operating performance 
growth in minimally invasive surgery procedures minimally invasive surgery is surgery performed without making a major incision or opening 
minimally invasive surgery generally results in less patient trauma  decreased likelihood of complications related to the incision and a shorter recovery time 
a growing number of surgical procedures are performed using minimally invasive techniques  creating a multi billion dollar market for the specialized devices used in the procedures 
based on our micro instrumentation capability  we believe we are ideally positioned to take advantage of this growing market 
the company has developed scissors having a single activating shaft as small as gauge inch  millimeter in diameter 
we also believe that we are the world leader in small fiber illumination technology as our photon tm and photon tm ii light sources can transmit more light through a fiber of micron diameter or smaller 
table of contents than any other light source in the world 
this product was developed for ophthalmology but has wide ranging minimally invasive surgical applications 
the company s malis line of electrosurgical bipolar generators is the market share leader in neurosurgical generators worldwide 
these generators produce a unique and patented waveform that has been developed and refined over many decades and has proven to cause less collateral tissue damage as compared to other competing generators 
the omni power ultrasound system technology provides a new method for the minimally invasive removal of soft and fibrotic tissue  as well as bone removal 
this technology is in its infancy  and we anticipate that  once fully developed  it will become a standard of care in multiple minimally invasive surgical applications 
the company has benefited from the overall growth in this market and expects to continue to benefit as it continues to introduce new and improved technologies targeting this market 
demand trends increased international sales contributed to the majority of sales growth for the company during the fiscal year ended july  a recent study performed for the company by market scope llc predicts a steady growth of percent per year in vitrectomy surgery worldwide 
neurosurgical procedures volume on a global basis continues to rise at an estimated percent growth rate driven by an aging global population  new technologies  advances in surgical techniques and a growing global market resulting from ongoing improvements in healthcare delivery in third world countries  among other factors 
in addition  the demand for high quality products and new technologies  such as the company s innovative instruments and disposables  to support growth in procedures volume continues to positively impact growth 
the company believes innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly impact the ophthalmic and neurosurgical market 
pricing trends through its strategy of delivering new and higher quality technologies  the company has generally been able to maintain the average selling prices for its products in the face of downward pressure in the healthcare industry 
however  increased competition in the market for the company s capital equipment market segments in combination with customer budget constraints and capital scarcity  has in some instances negatively impacted the company s selling prices on these devices 
economic trends economic conditions may continue to negatively impact capital expenditures at the hospital or surgical center and doctor level 
further  economic conditions in the united states are negatively impacting the volume of the company s capital equipment sales 
therefore  the company only experienced a percent increase in sales during the fiscal year as compared to a compound annual growth rate of approximately percent in fiscal our business strategy the company s key strategy is to enhance shareholder value through profitable revenue growth in ophthalmology and neurosurgery markets through the identification and development of reusable and disposable instrumentation in conjunction with leading surgeons and marketing partners and to build out a strong operational infrastructure and financial foundation within which prudently financed growth opportunities can be realized and implemented 
at the same time  we will maintain vigilance and sensitivity to new challenges which may arise from changes in the definition and delivery of appropriate healthcare in our fields of interest

additionally  as sales to our marketing partners did not increase as quickly as core product sales increased  this led to a significant increase in commissionable sales on a percentage basis 
commissionable sales increased from percent of sales during the fiscal year ended july  to percent in the fiscal year ended july  g a expenses decreased by million during the fiscal year ended july  and as a percentage of net sales were percent for the fiscal year ended july  as compared to percent for the fiscal year ended july  the company s legal expenses decreased by million during the fiscal year ended july  compared to the fiscal year ended july  as the cost associated primarily with the iridex lawsuit and subsequent settlement are no longer a significant factor 
the company also experienced a decrease of approximately  in outside consulting costs on the company s sarbanes oxley compliance efforts primarily due to the completion of documentation and testing of the former valley forge location in fiscal and the company s efforts to internalize a portion of the documentation procedures 
the company instituted a cost savings initiative in june of  which targeted selling  general and administrative sg a costs 
the additional sg a costs savings were offset by head count increases and the increase in amortization expense associated with the iridex settlement

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the financial results of the company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of synergetics usa and its wholly owned subsidiaries  synergetics  synergetics ip  inc  synergetics development company  llc and synergetics delaware  inc all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
revenue recognition the company records revenue from product sales when the revenue is realized and the product is shipped from its facilities 
this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  usually through receipt of a purchase order  the sales price is fixed and determinable  delivery to the carrier has occurred  and collectibility is reasonably ensured 
freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales  and the cost of shipping is included in cost of sales 
the terms and conditions of sales to both our domestic and international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to our domestic and international end user customers 
service revenue substantially relates to repairs of products and is recognized when the service has been completed 
revenue from licenses  extended warranty contracts and royalty fees is recorded when earned 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
the company s inventory is very dynamic and new products are added frequently 
thus  the company reviews the valuation of its inventory on a quarterly basis and determines if a valuation allowance is necessary for items that have not had their values updated recently 
in addition  the company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence quarterly 
the company s evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand  as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs 
to the extent that it determines there are some excess quantities based on its projected levels of sales and other requirements  or obsolete material in inventory  it records valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products 
if future cost valuations  future demand or market conditions are different from the 
table of contents company s projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
amortization periods the company records amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets 
it bases the determination of these useful lives on the period over which it expects the related assets to contribute to its cash flows or in the case of patents  their legal life  whichever is shorter 
if the company s assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  it may change future amortization expense see impairment of long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to the company  the company records an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that management reasonably expects to collect 
for all other customers  the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment  historical experience and credit insurance 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  the company may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
patents and research and development incremental legal and other costs to obtain patents are capitalized to a patent asset 
salaries  benefits and other direct costs of product development are expensed as operating expenses in r d costs 
patents are amortized to operations under the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining statutory life of the patent or the cash flow stream associated with that patent 
goodwill and other intangibles absent any impairment indicators  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the company performs its impairment tests during the fourth fiscal quarter 
management analyzes the valuation of its intangible assets by utilizing current and projected business operations  a market multiple method and a control valuation of equity method 
based on this analysis  we believe the enterprise value of our acquisition continues to be greater than our investment 
as a result  we have determined that no impairment of our goodwill has occurred 
while the annual impairment tests did not indicate goodwill impairment  we would be subject to future impairment if the operating results and cash flows of our operations would not support the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill 
intangibles assets  consisting of patents  licensing agreements and proprietary know how are amortized to operations under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives or statutory lives whichever is shorter 
these periods range from two to ten years 
the life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark or the life of the business entity owning the trademark 
the company intends to use the trademark indefinitely  and therefore  its useful life is not limited to any specific product 
the trademark constitutes an indefinite lived intangible that will be used in perpetuity 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable  but not less than annually 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 

table of contents deferred tax assets and liabilities the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when a determination is made that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowances are established and adjusted in accordance with the principles of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 

under fin no 
 if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  we recognize the benefit 
we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
we regularly monitor our tax positions and fin no 
tax liabilities 
we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit  or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit  when i there is a completion of a tax audit  ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance  or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 
significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities  positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods 
stock based compensation the company utilizes sfas r and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the directors and employees requisite service period 
compensation expense is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
of the inputs into the black scholes option pricing model  the one that can impact the value of the options the most is the volatility factor 
for awards occurring in fiscal year ended july   the company has utilized a volatility factor of percent in this calculation 
in addition  the company utilized an expected average risk free interest rate of percent  an expected average life of years and no expected dividends 
recent accounting pronouncements information about recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated audited financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rate variability 
the company has two revolving credit facilities and an equipment line of credit facility in place 
the primary revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance of million at july   bearing interest at a current rate of libor plus percent 
the non us receivables revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance at july  balances on this credit facility also bear interest at libor plus percent 
the equipment line of credit facility had a  outstanding balance at july   bearing interest at a current interest rate of libor plus percent 
interest expense from these credit facilities is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming the current levels of borrowings at variable rates and a two percentage point increase in the average interest rate on these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have increased by approximately  the company does not perform any interest rate hedging activities related to these three facilities 
additionally  the company has exposure to non us currency fluctuations through export sales to international accounts 
as only approximately percent of our sales revenue is denominated in non us currencies  we estimate that a change in the relative strength of the dollar to non us currencies would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company does not conduct any hedging activities related to non us currency
