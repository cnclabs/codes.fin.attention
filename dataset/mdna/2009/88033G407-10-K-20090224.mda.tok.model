item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
properties description of real property 
the locations of our hospitals and the number of licensed beds at each hospital at december  are set forth in the table beginning on page at december   our subsidiaries also owned or leased and operated medical office buildings  most of which are adjacent to our general hospitals 
we have retained jones lang lasalle  a nationally recognized real estate broker and advisor  to assist us in the promotion  marketing and sale of up to of these medical office buildings  totaling approximately million square feet of rental space  in an effort to generate incremental cash and increase our financial flexibility 
our corporate headquarters are located in dallas  texas and  at december   our other corporate administrative offices were located in santa ana  california  coral springs  florida  and philadelphia  pennsylvania 
one of our subsidiaries leases the space for our current corporate headquarters office under an operating lease agreement that expires in december in august  we announced that we will move our corporate headquarters from north dallas to downtown dallas in the fourth quarter of one of our subsidiaries will lease our new space under an operating lease agreement that expires in december other subsidiaries lease the space for our offices in santa ana  coral springs and philadelphia under operating lease agreements 
we believe that all of our properties  including the administrative and medical office buildings described above  are suitable for their intended purposes 
obligations relating to real property 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding loans secured by property and equipment  and we had approximately million of capital lease obligations 
in addition  from time to time  we lease real property to third party developers for the construction of medical office buildings 
under our current practice  the financing necessary to construct the medical office buildings encumbers only the leasehold and not our fee interest in the real estate 
in years past  however  we have at times subordinated our fee interest and allowed our property to be pledged as collateral for third party loans 
we have no contractual obligation to make payments on these third party loans  but our property could be subject to loss in the case of default by the lessee 
regulations affecting real property 
we are subject to a number of laws and regulations affecting our use of  and purchase and sale of  real property 
among these are california s seismic standards  the americans with disabilities act ada  and various environmental laws and regulations 
the state of california has established standards intended to ensure that all hospitals in the state withstand earthquakes and other seismic activity without collapsing or posing the threat of significant loss of life 
in general  we are required to meet these standards by december   subject to a two year extension for hospital projects that are underway in advance of that date 
in november  the california building standards commission adopted regulations permitting the use of a new computerized evaluation tool for determining how at risk hospital buildings are of collapse in an earthquake  and use of this new tool has resulted in fewer hospitals requiring retrofitting by the deadline 
we currently estimate spending a total of approximately million to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations 
our current estimated seismic costs are considerably lower than our prior year estimate because several of our hospitals have been evaluated as having reduced risk using the new evaluation tool 
our total estimated seismic expenditure amount has not been adjusted for inflation 
in addition to safety standards  over time  hospitals must also meet performance standards meant to ensure that they are generally capable of providing medical services to the public after an earthquake or other disaster 
ultimately  all general acute care hospitals in california must meet seismic performance standards by to remain open 
to date  we have conducted engineering studies and developed compliance plans for all of our california facilities in continuing operations 
at this time  all of our general acute care hospitals in california are in compliance with all current seismic requirements 

table of contents the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public accommodations  including hospitals and other health care facilities  be made accessible to disabled persons 
certain of our facilities are subject to a negotiated consent decree involving disability access as a result of a class action lawsuit 
in accordance with the terms of the consent decree  our facilities have agreed to implement disability access improvements  but have not admitted that they have engaged in any wrongful action or inaction 
in the year ended december   we spent approximately million on corrective work at our facilities  and we currently anticipate spending an additional million over the next seven years 
we were previously required to complete the same work over the next three years  but negotiated an extension to allow for a more orderly use of cash flow 
noncompliance with the requirements of the ada or similar state laws could result in the imposition of fines against us by federal and state governments or the award of damages from us to individual plaintiffs 
in addition  noncompliance with court orders and consent decrees requiring disability access improvements could result in contempt proceedings and the imposition of criminal penalties 
our properties are also subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations  including with respect to asbestos abatement and the treatment of underground storage tanks  among other matters 
we believe it is unlikely that the cost of complying with such laws  rules and regulations will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
medical staff and employees general 
our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staffs of individual hospitals 
under state laws and other licensing standards  hospital medical staffs are generally self governing organizations subject to ultimate oversight by the hospital s local governing board 
members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also often serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us 
members of our medical staffs are free to terminate their affiliation with our hospitals or admit their patients to competing hospitals at any time 
although we operate some physician practices and  where permitted by law  employ some physicians  the overwhelming majority of the physicians who practice at our hospitals are not our employees 
nurses  therapists  lab technicians  facility maintenance workers and the administrative staffs of hospitals  however  normally are our employees 
we are subject to federal minimum wage and hour laws and various state labor laws  and maintain a number of different employee benefit plans 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of our employees and the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain skilled employees and an appropriate number of quality physicians and other health care professionals in all specialties on our medical staffs 
although we had a net overall gain in physicians added to our medical staffs during and  in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are still affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives  including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
in some of our markets  we have not been able to attract physicians to our medical staffs at a rate to offset the physicians relocating or retiring 
we continue to take steps to successfully attract and retain key employees  qualified physicians and other health care professionals 
one of our initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered on understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
in general  the loss of some or all of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified physicians and other health care professionals could have a material adverse effect on patient volumes and  thereby  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents at december   the approximate number of our employees of which approximately were part time employees was as follows general hospitals and related health care facilities administrative offices total includes employees whose employment related to the operations of our general hospitals  cancer hospital  critical access facility  rehabilitation hospital  long term acute care hospital  skilled nursing facility  outpatient surgery centers  diagnostic imaging centers  occupational and rural health care clinics  physician practices  in house collection agency and other health care operations in both continuing and discontinued operations 
at december   the largest concentrations of our employees excluding those in our administrative offices  but including those at our general hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were in those states where we had the largest concentrations of licensed hospital beds of employees of licensed beds california florida texas union activity and labor relations 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were represented by labor unions 
labor relations at our facilities generally have been satisfactory 
we  and the hospital industry in general  are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
as union activity increases  our salaries  wages and benefits expense may increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues 
in  we entered into new labor contracts and completed the renegotiation of expired collective bargaining agreements with the california nurses association cna  the service employees international union seiu and the united nurses associations of california unac 
these agreements cover registered nurses  service and maintenance workers  and other employees at of our continuing general hospitals in california and three of our continuing general hospitals in florida 
we have also entered into labor contracts with the american federation of state  county and municipal employees that cover technical  clerical  service and maintenance workers at our hahnemann university hospital in philadelphia 
all of these union agreements set stable and competitive wage increases within our budgeted expectations through various dates in and early also in  we entered into separate peace accords with both the cna and the seiu that provide each union with limited access to attempt to organize certain of our employees and establish specific guidelines for the parties to follow with respect to organizing activities 
both peace accords expire in december such agreements have become more common as employers attempt to balance the disruption caused by traditional union organizing with the rights of employees to determine for themselves whether to seek union representation 
in  the cna and the seiu commenced union organizing activities at several of our hospitals 
to date  we have granted the cna access to hahnemann university hospital in philadelphia and three of our hospitals in houston cypress fairbanks medical center  park plaza hospital and houston northwest medical center all pursuant to the terms of our peace accord with the cna 
we are currently engaged in collective bargaining with the cna at cypress fairbanks medical center after registered nurses at that facility voted in favor of representation by the cna in march and the results of that election were certified by the national labor relations board nlrb in may in august  two registered nurses from cypress fairbanks medical center and park plaza hospital  with the help of the national right to work legal defense foundation  filed unfair labor practice charges against us and the cna with the nlrb 
the charges allege that our peace accord with the cna violates federal rules prohibiting employer dominated unions and improperly restricts nurses from speaking out against the union 
the filing also claims that the peace accord subverts the nlrb s role by stipulating that an arbitrator will resolve conflicts rather than federal board representatives 
in february  additional charges were filed with the nlrb relating to our hahnemann university hospital in philadelphia 
the nlrb is considerating all of the claims  and we expect a formal decision shortly  however  we presently cannot determine the ultimate resolution of this matter 
separately  we are defending our actions in connection with the seiu s failed attempt to organize employees at our saint francis hospital in memphis  tennessee 
a trial in that matter was expected to commence in january  but has since been postponed while the parties engage in settlement discussions 
in addition  in january  we executed an agreement with the seiu postponing for one year any further organizing efforts by that union as contemplated by the terms of our peace accord 

table of contents nursing shortage and mandatory nurse staffing ratios 
in addition to union activity  factors that adversely affect our labor costs include the nationwide shortage of nurses and the enactment of state laws regarding nurse staffing ratios 
the national nursing shortage continues and remains more serious in key specialties and in certain geographic areas than others  including several areas in which we operate hospitals 
the nursing shortage has been a significant operating issue to health care providers  including us  and has resulted in increased labor costs for nursing personnel 
in addition  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
the vast majority of hospitals in california  including our hospitals  are not at all times meeting the state mandated nurse staffing ratios  however  we have continued to improve our compliance and strive to make further improvements in nurse staffing ratio legislation has been proposed  but not yet enacted  in other states in which we operate hospitals  including pennsylvania and texas 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by the future availability or cost of nursing personnel  but we expect to continue to experience significant salary  wage and benefit pressures created by the nursing shortage throughout the country and state mandated nurse staffing ratios  particularly in california 
in addition  we have been and may continue to be required to increase our use of temporary personnel  which is typically more expensive than hiring full time or part time employees 
efforts are being made to address workforce development with local schools of nursing and in recruitment of new graduates and experienced nurses 
competition in general  competition among health care providers occurs primarily at the local level 
a hospital s position within the geographic area in which it operates is affected by a number of competitive factors  including  but not limited to the scope  breadth and quality of services a hospital offers to its patients and physicians  the number  quality and specialties of the physicians who admit and refer patients to the hospital  nurses and other health care professionals employed by the hospital or on the hospital s staff  the hospital s reputation  its managed care contracting relationships  its location  the location and number of competitive facilities and other health care alternatives  the physical condition of its buildings and improvements  the quality  age and state of the art of its medical equipment  its parking or proximity to public transportation  the length of time it has been a part of the community  and the charges for its services 
in addition  tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
in certain states  including california  some not for profit hospitals are permitted by law to directly employ physicians while for profit hospitals are prohibited from doing so 
we also face increasing competition from physician owned specialty hospitals and freestanding diagnostic and imaging centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
overall  our general hospitals and other health care businesses operate in highly competitive environments  and we believe declines we have experienced in our patient volumes over the last several years can be attributed  in part  to increased competition for physicians and patients 
we continue to take steps to address competition and increase patient volumes 
broadly speaking  we attract physicians by striving to equip our hospitals with technologically advanced equipment and quality physical plant  properly maintaining the equipment and physical plant  providing high quality care to our patients and otherwise creating an environment within which physicians prefer to practice 
one of our specific initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered around understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
we have targeted capital spending in order to address specific needs or growth opportunities of our hospitals  which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes 
as part of our efforts to attract both physicians and patients  we have sought to include all of our hospitals in the affected geographic area or nationally when negotiating new managed care contracts  which should result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks 
in addition  we have been completing clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve our operating results 
this targeted growth initiative has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations  which have had a slightly negative impact on our volumes 
however  the elimination of these unprofitable service lines will allow us to focus more resources on services that are more profitable 
our commitment to quality initiative is further helping position us to competitively meet the volume challenge 
we continue to work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based techniques to improve the way we provide care 
as a result of these efforts  our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care 
we believe that quality of care improvements will continue to have the effect of increasing physician and patient satisfaction  potentially improving our volumes as a result 

table of contents further  each hospital has a local governing board  consisting primarily of community members and physicians that develop short term and long term plans for the hospital to foster a desirable medical environment for physicians 
each local governing board also reviews and approves  as appropriate  actions of the medical staff  including staff appointments  credentialing  peer review and quality assurance 
while physicians may terminate their association with our hospitals at any time  we believe that by striving to maintain and improve the quality of care at our hospitals and by maintaining ethical and professional standards  we will attract and retain qualified physicians with a variety of specialties 
health care regulation and licensing certain background information health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
changes in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government health care programs  hospital cost containment initiatives by public and private payers  proposals to limit payments and health care spending  and industry wide competitive factors greatly impact the health care industry 
the industry is also subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  physician relationships  addition of facilities and services  and reimbursement rates for services 
the laws  rules and regulations governing the health care industry are extremely complex  and  in certain areas  the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance 
although we have extensive policies and procedures in place to facilitate compliance in all material respects with such laws  rules and regulations  if a determination is made that we were in material violation of such laws  rules or regulations  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
both federal and state government agencies continue heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts against the health care industry 
under the authority of the inspector general act of  the office of inspector general oig of the us department of health and human services hhs on an annual basis conducts a comprehensive work planning process to identify the areas most worthy of attention in the coming year 
in recent years  the oig has allocated approximately of its resources to reviews and investigations of the medicare and medicaid programs and to hhs public health and human services programs 
in its fiscal year work plan  the oig set forth detailed information about its ongoing and planned work examining the integrity of medicare and medicaid payments and services  including payments made and services provided by hospitals 
an online version of the work plan is available at http oig 
hhs 
gov publications docs workplan workplanfypdf 
we believe that we  and the health care industry in general  will continue to be subject to increased government scrutiny and investigations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
health care providers are also subject to qui tam lawsuits under the federal false claims act 
qui tam or whistleblower actions can also be filed under certain state false claims laws if the fraud involves medicaid funds or funding from state and local agencies 
federal and state false claims laws allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government  alleging that a hospital or health care provider has defrauded a federal or state government program  such as medicare or medicaid 
if the government intervenes in the action and prevails  the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties for each false claim submitted to the government 
as part of the resolution of a qui tam case  the party filing the initial complaint may share in a portion of any settlement or judgment 
if the government does not intervene in the action  the qui tam plaintiff may continue to pursue the action independently 
although companies in the health care industry in general  and us in particular  have been and may continue to be subject to qui tam actions  we are unable to predict the future impact of such actions on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
anti kickback and self referral regulations medicare and medicaid anti kickback and anti fraud and abuse amendments codified under section b b of the social security act the anti kickback statute prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of health care services payable under the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs  
table of contents including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid for by such programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal and civil penalties  as well as fines and possible exclusion from government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
many states have statutes similar to the federal anti kickback statute  except that the state statutes usually apply to referrals for services reimbursed by all third party payers  not just federal programs 
in addition  it is a violation of the federal civil monetary penalties law to offer or transfer anything of value to medicare or medicaid beneficiaries that is likely to influence their decision to obtain covered goods or services from one provider or service over another 
the federal government has also issued regulations that describe some of the conduct and business relationships that are permissible under the anti kickback statute 
these regulations are often referred to as the safe harbor regulations 
the fact that certain conduct or a given business arrangement does not meet a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute 
rather  such conduct and business arrangements risk increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and should be reviewed on a case by case basis 
in addition to addressing other matters  as discussed below  the health insurance portability and accountability act of also amended title xi usc section et seq 
to broaden the scope of fraud and abuse laws to include all health plans  whether or not payments under such health plans are made pursuant to a federal program 
section of the social security act commonly referred to as the stark law generally restricts referrals by physicians of medicare or medicaid patients to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship  unless one of several exceptions applies 
the referral prohibition applies to a number of statutorily defined designated health services  such as clinical laboratory  physical therapy  radiology  and inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
the exceptions to the referral prohibition cover a broad range of common financial relationships 
these statutory  and the subsequent regulatory  exceptions are available to protect certain permitted employment relationships  leases  group practice arrangements  medical directorships  and other common relationships between physicians and providers of designated health services  such as hospitals 
a violation of the stark law may result in a denial of payment  required refunds to patients and the medicare program  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each violation  civil monetary penalties of up to  for sham arrangements  civil monetary penalties of up to  for each day that an entity fails to report required information  and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other federal programs 
many states have adopted or are considering similar self referral statutes  some of which extend beyond the related state medicaid program to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
our participation in and development of joint ventures and other financial relationships with physicians could be adversely affected by these amendments and similar state enactments 
in accordance with our compliance program and our corporate integrity agreement with the federal government  which are described in detail under compliance program below  we have in place policies and procedures concerning compliance with the anti kickback statute and the stark law  among others 
in addition  our compliance  law and audit services departments systematically review a substantial number of our arrangements with referral sources to determine the extent to which they comply with our policies and procedures and with the anti kickback statute  the stark law and similar state statutes 
health insurance portability and accountability act title ii  subtitle f of the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa mandates the adoption of specific standards for electronic transactions and code sets that are used to transmit certain types of health information 
hipaa s objective is to encourage efficiency and reduce the cost of operations within the health care industry 
to protect the information transmitted using the mandated standards and the patient information used in the daily operations of a covered entity  hipaa also sets forth federal rules protecting the privacy and security of protected health information 
the privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the rights of patients to understand and control how their information is used and disclosed 
the law provides both criminal and civil fines and penalties for covered entities that fail to comply with hipaa 
hhs regulations include deadlines for compliance with the various provisions of hipaa 
effective october   cms will not process electronic claims that do not meet hipaa s electronic data transmission transaction and code set standards that health care providers must use when transmitting certain health care information electronically 
our electronic data transmissions are compliant with current standards 

table of contents all covered entities  including those we operate  are required to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa 
we are in material compliance with the privacy and security regulations  and we will continue to update training and procedures to address any compliance issues that develop 
further  all covered entities  including those we operate  have been assigned unique digit numeric identifiers and otherwise currently comply with the national provider identifier requirements of hipaa 
we have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with hipaa  and similar state privacy laws  under the guidance of our compliance department 
hospital compliance officers and information security officers are responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with our hipaa privacy and security policies and procedures at our hospitals 
we have also created an internal web based hipaa training program  which is mandatory for all employees 
based on existing and currently proposed regulations  as well as our experience with hipaa to this point  we continue to believe that the ongoing costs of complying with hipaa will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
health care facility licensing requirements in order to maintain their operating licenses  health care facilities must comply with strict governmental standards concerning medical care  equipment and cleanliness 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
our health care facilities hold all required governmental approvals  licenses and permits material to the operation of their business 
utilization review compliance and hospital governance in addition to certain statutory coverage limits and exclusions  federal laws and regulations  specifically the medicare conditions of participation  generally require health care providers  including hospitals that furnish or order health care services that may be paid for under the medicare program or state health care programs  to assure that claims for reimbursement are for services or items that are provided economically and only when  and to the extent  they are medically reasonable and necessary  of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care  and supported by appropriate evidence of medical necessity and quality 
cms administers the quality improvement organization qio program through a network of qios that work with consumers  physicians  hospitals and other caregivers to refine care delivery systems to assure patients receive the appropriate care at the appropriate time  particularly among underserved populations 
the qio program also safeguards the integrity of the medicare trust fund by reviewing medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges  and ensuring payment is made only for medically necessary services  and investigates beneficiary complaints about quality of care 
the qios have the authority to deny payment for services provided and recommend to hhs that a provider that is in substantial noncompliance with certain standards be excluded from participating in the medicare program 
medical and surgical services and practices are extensively supervised by committees of staff doctors at each of our health care facilities  are overseen by each facility s local governing board  the members of which primarily are community members and physicians  and are reviewed by our clinical quality personnel 
the local hospital governing board also helps maintain standards for quality care  develop short term and long range plans  and establish  review and enforce practices and procedures  as well as approves the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members 
certificate of need requirements some states require state approval for construction  expansion and closure of health care facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services 
certificates of need  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over health care facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services  and certain other matters 
as of december   we operated hospitals in eight states that require a form of state approval under certificate of need programs applicable to those hospitals 
we are unable to predict whether we will be required or able to obtain any additional certificates of need in any jurisdiction where they are required  or if any jurisdiction will eliminate or alter its certificate of need requirements in a manner that will increase competition and  thereby  affect our competitive position 
environmental regulations our health care operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
our operations also are subject to compliance with various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
we believe it is unlikely that the cost of such compliance will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents compliance program general 
we maintain a multi faceted corporate and hospital based compliance program that is designed to assist our corporate and hospital staff to meet or exceed applicable standards established by federal and state laws and regulations and industry practice 
we established an independent compliance department in to manage compliance related functions previously managed by our law department 
to ensure the independence of the compliance department  the following measures were implemented the compliance department has its own operating budget  the compliance department has the authority to hire outside counsel  access any tenet document and interview any of our personnel  and our chief compliance officer reports directly to the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors 
in may  the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors approved an updated ethics and compliance program charter that furthers our goal of fostering and maintaining the highest ethical standards  and valuing our compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations as a foundation of our corporate philosophy 
the primary focus of the program is compliance with the requirements of the medicare and medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs 
pursuant to the terms of the charter  the compliance department is responsible for the following activities drafting company policies and procedures related to ethics and compliance issues  developing and providing compliance related education and training to all of our employees and  as appropriate  directors  contractors  agents and staff physicians  creating and disseminating our standards of conduct  monitoring  responding to and resolving all ethics and compliance related issues  ensuring that we take appropriate corrective and disciplinary action when noncompliant or improper conduct is identified  and measuring compliance with our policies and legal and regulatory requirements related to federal health care programs and our corporate integrity agreement described below 
in  we significantly expanded our compliance staff 
as part of this expansion  we hired regional compliance directors and have named a compliance officer for each hospital 
all hospital based compliance officers report to regional compliance directors who report directly to our chief compliance officer 
corporate integrity agreement 
in june  we entered into a broad civil settlement agreement with the us department of justice doj and other federal agencies that concluded several previously disclosed governmental investigations  including inquiries into our receipt of certain medicare outlier payments before  physician financial arrangements and medicare coding issues 
in accordance with the terms of the settlement  we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia in september with the oig 
the cia establishes annual training requirements and compliance reviews by independent review organizations in specific areas 
in particular  the cia requires  among other things  that we maintain our existing company wide quality initiatives in the areas of evidence based medicine  standards of clinical excellence and quality measurements  maintain our existing company wide compliance program and code of conduct  formalize in writing our policies and procedures in the areas of billing and reimbursement  compliance with the anti kickback statute and the stark law  and clinical quality  almost all of which were already in place when we entered into the cia and the remainder of which were put into place by january  provide a variety of general and specialized compliance training to our employees  contractors and physicians we employ or who serve as medical directors and or serve on our hospitals governing boards  and engage independent outside entities to provide reviews of compliance and effectiveness in five areas medicare outlier payments  diagnosis related group claims  unallowable costs  physician financial arrangements and clinical quality systems 
further  the cia requires us to maintain or establish performance standards and incentives that link compensation and incentive awards directly to clinical quality measures and compliance program effectiveness measures 
the cia also establishes a number of specific requirements for the quality  compliance and ethics committee of our board of directors 
notably  the committee must 
table of contents retain an independent compliance expert  and assess our compliance program  including arranging for the performance of a review of the effectiveness of the program 
based on this work  the committee must then adopt a resolution for each reporting period of the cia regarding its conclusions as to whether we have implemented an effective compliance program 
we have taken  and continue to take  all necessary steps to promote compliance with the terms of the cia 
ethics program we maintain a values based ethics program that is designed to monitor and raise awareness of ethical issues among employees and to stress the importance of understanding and complying with our standards of conduct 
all of our employees  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and principal accounting officer  are required to abide by our standards of conduct to ensure that our business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner 
the members of our board of directors and many of our contractors are also required to abide by our standards of conduct 
the standards reflect our basic values and form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with all corporate policies  procedures and practices 
our standards cover such areas as quality patient care  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  appropriate use of our assets  protection of patient information and avoidance of conflicts of interest 
as part of the program  we provide annual ethics and compliance training sessions to every employee  as well as our board of directors and certain physicians and contractors 
all employees are required to report incidents that they believe in good faith may be in violation of the standards of conduct  and are encouraged to contact our hour toll free ethics action line when they have questions about the standards or any ethics concerns 
incidents of alleged financial improprieties reported to the ethics action line or the compliance department are communicated to the audit committee of our board of directors 
all reports to the ethics action line are kept confidential to the extent allowed by law  and employees have the option to remain anonymous 
in cases reported to the ethics action line that involve a possible violation of the law or regulatory policies and procedures  the matter is referred to the compliance department for investigation 
retaliation against employees in connection with reporting ethical concerns is considered a serious violation of our standards of conduct  and  if it occurs  it will result in discipline  up to and including termination of employment 
the full text of our standards of conduct  and a number of our ethics and compliance policies and procedures  are published on our website  at www 
tenethealth 
com  under the compliance ethics caption in the our company section 
a copy of our standards of conduct is also available upon written request to our corporate secretary 
property and professional and general liability insurance property insurance 
we have property  business interruption and related insurance coverage to mitigate the financial impact of catastrophic events or perils that is subject to deductible provisions based on the terms of the policies 
these policies are on an occurrence basis 
under the policies in effect for the period april  through march   we had coverage totaling million per occurrence  after deductibles and exclusions  with annual aggregate sub limits of million each for floods and earthquakes and a per occurrence sub limit of million for windstorms with no annual aggregate 
with respect to fires and other perils  excluding floods  earthquakes and windstorms  the total million limit of coverage per occurrence applies 
deductibles are of insured values for floods  california earthquakes and wind related claims  of insured values for new madrid fault earthquakes  and million for fires and other perils 
for the policy period april  through march   we have coverage totaling million per occurrence  after deductibles and exclusions  with annual aggregate sub limits of million each for floods and earthquakes and a per occurrence sub limit of million for windstorms with no annual aggregate 
with respect to fires and other perils  excluding floods  earthquakes and windstorms  the total million limit of coverage per occurrence applies 
deductibles are of insured values up to a maximum of million for floods  california earthquakes and wind related claims  and of insured values for new madrid fault earthquakes  with a maximum per claim deductible of million 
other covered losses  including fires and other perils  have a minimum deductible of million 
professional and general liability insurance 
as is typical in the health care industry  we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
the health care industry has seen significant increases in the cost of professional liability insurance due to increased litigation 
in response  we formed captive insurance companies to self insure a substantial portion of our professional and general liability risk 
claims in excess of our self insurance retentions are insured with commercial insurance companies 

table of contents as of january   our hospitals generally have a self insurance retention of million per occurrence for all claims incurred since june  our captive insurance company  the healthcare insurance corporation thinc  retains million per occurrence above our hospitals million self insurance retention level 
claims in excess of these aggregate self insurance retentions of million per occurrence are substantially reinsured up to million  except  beginning june   thinc is retaining of the next million for each claim that exceeds million or a maximum of million 
claims in excess of million are covered by our excess professional and general liability insurance policies from major independent insurance companies  on a claims made basis  subject to aggregate limits 
if the aggregate limit of any of our excess professional and general liability policies is exhausted  in whole or in part  it could deplete or reduce the excess limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period 
any losses not covered by or in excess of the amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from our working capital 
in addition to the reserves recorded by our captive insurance subsidiaries  we maintain reserves  including reserves for incurred but not reported claims  for our self insured professional liability retentions and claims in excess of the policies aggregate limits  based on actuarial estimates of losses and related expenses 
also  we provide letters of credit to certain of our insurers  which can be drawn upon under certain circumstances  to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under a selected number of our professional and general liability insurance programs

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control that may cause our actual operating results or financial performance to be materially different from our expectations 
if one or more of the events discussed in the following risks were to occur  actual outcomes could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward looking statements we make in this report or our other filings with the sec  and our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also negatively affect our business and operations 
in either case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and shareholders could lose all or part of their investment 
if we are unable to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms  or if we have difficulty collecting from managed care payers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenue from our continuing general hospitals during the year ended december  was billion  which represented approximately of our total net patient revenues from continuing general hospitals 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
at december   approximately of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers 
it would harm our business if we were unable to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms 
any material reductions in the payments that we receive for our services  coupled with any difficulties in collecting receivables from managed care payers  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in the medicare and medicaid programs or other government health care programs could have an adverse effect on our business 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net patient revenues from our continuing general hospitals were received from the medicare program  and approximately of our net patient revenues from our continuing general hospitals were received from various state medicaid programs  in each case excluding medicare and medicaid managed care programs 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements  funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements  among other things  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities 
several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers 
further  although most states addressed projected budgetary gaps in their final budgets  because of the recent economic downturn  many states including florida and california are facing mid year budget gaps that could result in additional reductions to medicaid payments  coverage and eligibility or additional taxes on hospitals 

table of contents in general  we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited or if we  or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals  are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business continues to be adversely affected by a high volume of uninsured and underinsured patients  as well as declines in commercial managed care patients 
like other organizations in the health care industry  we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with an increased burden of co payments and deductibles as a result of changes in their health care plans 
as a result  we continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts  and  unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients or the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses  we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue or increase 
at the same time  we continue to experience declines in our commercial managed care volumes  which in the aggregate generate substantially higher yields than medicare and medicaid volumes 
in the year ended december   same hospital commercial managed care admissions declined and same hospital commercial managed care outpatient visits declined compared to the year ended december  in particular  our levels of elective procedures  due to the related effects of higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment  may be materially impacted if the current economic environment continues 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  and competition is one reason for declines we may experience in patient volumes 
a number of factors affect patient volumes and  thereby  our results of operations at our hospitals and related health care facilities  including the influence of local health care competitors 
generally  other hospitals in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals 
some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by government agencies or not for profit organizations 
tax exempt competitors may have certain financial advantages not available to our facilities  such as endowments  charitable contributions  tax exempt financing  and exemptions from sales  property and income taxes 
in certain states  including california  some not for profit hospitals are permitted by law to directly employ physicians while for profit hospitals are prohibited from doing so 
we also face increasing competition from physician owned specialty hospitals and freestanding surgery  diagnostic and imaging centers for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
if competing health care providers are better able to attract more patients  recruit and retain physicians  expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities  our patient volume levels may suffer 
our business and financial condition could be harmed if we are not able to attract and retain employees  physicians and other health care professionals  and our labor costs continue to be adversely affected by union activity and the shortage of nurses 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of our employees and the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain skilled employees and an appropriate number of quality physicians and other health care professionals in all specialties on our medical staffs 
in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives  including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
in some of our markets  we have not been able to attract physicians to our medical staffs at a rate to offset the physicians relocating or retiring 
in general  the loss of some or all of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified physicians and other health care professionals could have a material adverse effect on patient volumes and  thereby  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that adversely affect our labor costs include union activity  the nationwide shortage of nurses and the enactment of state laws regarding nurse staffing ratios 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were represented by labor unions  and we and the hospital industry in general are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
further  the national nursing shortage continues and remains more serious in key specialties and in certain geographic areas than others  
table of contents including several areas in which we operate hospitals 
the nursing shortage has been a significant operating issue to health care providers  including us  and has resulted in increased labor costs for nursing personnel 
in addition  state mandated nurse staffing ratios in california affect not only our labor costs  but  if we are unable to hire the necessary number of nurses to meet the required ratios  they may also cause us to limit patient admissions with a corresponding adverse effect on our net operating revenues 
we cannot predict the degree to which we will be affected by future union activity or the future availability or cost of nursing personnel  but we expect to continue to experience significant salary  wage and benefit pressures 
in addition  we have been and may continue to be required to increase our use of temporary personnel  which is typically more expensive than hiring full time or part time employees 
our licensed hospital beds are heavily concentrated in certain market areas in florida  california and texas  which makes us sensitive to economic  regulatory  environmental and other developments in those areas 
as of december   the largest concentrations of licensed beds in our general hospitals were in florida  california and texas 
such concentrations increase the risk that  should any adverse economic  regulatory  environmental or other developments occur in these areas  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
specifically  a natural disaster or other catastrophic event could affect us more significantly than other companies with less geographic concentration 
in the recent past  hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in florida and texas  as well as in louisiana  and the patient populations in those states 
our california operations could be adversely affected by a major earthquake or wildfires in that state 
moreover  at december   we expected to spend a total of approximately million unadjusted for inflation to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations for hospitals 
our business and financial results could be harmed by violations of existing regulations or compliance with new or changed regulations 
our business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation relating to  among other things  licensure  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  physician relationships  addition of facilities and services  and reimbursement rates for services 
the laws  rules and regulations governing the health care industry are extremely complex  and  in certain areas  the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance 
if a determination is made that we were in material violation of such laws  rules or regulations  we could be subject to penalties or liabilities or required to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations 
further changes in the regulatory framework affecting health care providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our operations have not been profitable for most of the last several years  and  if our turnaround strategy is not successful  our business operations and financial results may not improve and could worsen 
we reported losses from continuing operations for the years ended december  through these results of operations reflect the challenges we have faced in restructuring our business to focus on a smaller group of general hospitals 
we have been executing a turnaround strategy designed to improve profitability and margins through initiatives to grow volumes  maintain adequate reimbursement levels and control costs 
however  our turnaround timeframe has been impacted by company specific challenges and overall industry trends  including declines in patient volumes over the last several years and high bad debt levels  which continue to negatively affect our revenue growth and operating results 
if our turnaround strategy is not successful or the industry trends worsen  we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability  and our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed 

table of contents trends affecting our actual or anticipated results may lead to charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
as a result of the various factors that affect our industry generally and our business specifically  we have been required to record charges in our results of operations 
based on future financial trends and the possible impact of negative trends on our future outlook  further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we will incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our operating structure that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill 
any such charges could adversely affect our results of operations 
the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide 
this shortage of liquidity and credit  combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets  could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession and result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access those markets  which could have a negative impact on our growth plans  our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions  and our ability to refinance existing debt 
the financial and credit crisis also could have an impact on the lenders under our credit facilities  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
in addition  our levels of elective procedures and our ability to collect accounts receivable  due to the effects of higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment  may be materially impacted if the current economic environment continues 
our substantial leverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are a highly leveraged company 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total long term debt  as well as approximately million in letters of credit outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility  which is collateralized by patient accounts receivable at our acute care and specialty hospitals 
in addition  in early  we made an offer to exchange up to billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes maturing in december and june for an equal aggregate principal amount of two new series of senior secured notes maturing in and in a private placement 
as of the filing date of this report  the offer remained open 
any new notes ultimately issued as part of the exchange offer will be guaranteed by and secured by a pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our subsidiaries 
although the total amount of our long term debt will not change as a result of the exchange offer  the interest rates on the new notes actually issued in connection with the exchange offer will be higher than the interest rates on our existing and notes  resulting in increased interest expense for us 
we may also be required to record a significant net gain in connection with the exchange offer  primarily based on the anticipated fair value of the new notes 
from time to time  we expect to engage in additional capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
our leverage and debt service obligations could have important consequences to an investor  including the following our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes contain  and any future debt obligations may contain  covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and sell assets 
if we do not comply with these obligations  it may cause an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could require us to repay the indebtedness immediately 
we may be more vulnerable in the event of a deterioration in our business  in the health care industry  in the economy generally or if federal or state governments set further limitations on reimbursement under the medicare or medicaid programs 
we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at economically acceptable interest rates and other terms to meet our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  the payment of judgments or settlements  or general corporate purposes 
we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  which could reduce the amount of funds available for our operations

v 
tenet healthcare corporation  et al  case no 
cv rjk cwx us district court for the central district of california  filed june  in june  four purported tenet shareholders who opted out of the settlement of the federal securities class action lawsuit entitled in re tenet healthcare corporation securities litigation filed a civil complaint in the us district court for the central district of california against the company  certain former executive officers of the company and kpmg llp kpmg  the company s former independent registered public accounting firm 
plaintiffs asserted substantively the same factual allegations concerning tenet s receipt and disclosure of medicare outlier payments that were asserted in the federal securities class action lawsuit 
specifically  plaintiffs alleged the following claims that the company  kpmg and former executives jeffrey barbakow  david dennis and thomas mackey are liable for securities fraud under section b of and rule b under the exchange act  and that defendants jeffrey barbakow  david dennis  thomas mackey  raymond mathiasen  barry schochet and christi sulzbach are liable for control person liability pursuant to section a of the exchange act

table of contents wage and hour actions in september  the court granted our petition to coordinate two pending proposed class action lawsuits  mcdonough  et al 
v 
tenet healthcare corporation and tien  et al 
v 
tenet healthcare corporation  in los angeles superior court 
the mcdonough case was originally filed in june in san diego superior court  and the tien case was originally filed in may in los angeles superior court 
plaintiffs in both cases allege that our hospitals violated certain provisions of the california labor code and applicable california industrial welfare commission wage orders with respect to meal breaks  rest periods and the payment of one hour s compensation for meal breaks or rest periods not taken 
the complaint in the tien case also alleges that we have improperly rounded off time entries on timekeeping records and that our pay stubs do not include all information required by california law 
plaintiffs in both cases are seeking back pay  statutory penalties  interest and attorneys fees 
plaintiffs in the mcdonough and tien cases filed motions  which we opposed  to certify these actions on behalf of virtually all nonexempt employees of our california subsidiaries  as separated into four classes and one subclass based on the specific claims at issue 
the court issued an initial ruling on plaintiffs motions in june in that ruling  the court denied plaintiffs request for class certification on the claim that employees missed rest periods 
however  the court granted plaintiffs request for class certification on the claims that employees pay stubs did not contain all information required by california law and hourly employees did not receive appropriate wages due at the time of their termination 
the court also certified a subclass of hour shift employees who received missed meal penalties at a reduced rate  but stated that this subclass should be handled in connection with the pagaduan action discussed below 
lastly  the court conditionally certified a class of all current or former hourly employees who were allegedly not provided meal periods  for the purpose of determining certain limited preliminary factual issues 
we filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s class certification ruling and  on november   the court issued a reconsidered ruling denying class certification with respect to all of plaintiffs claims  except the subclass involving hour shift employees 
on december   plaintiffs dismissed the claims of that subclass  which left only the claims of the individual plaintiffs 
at a status conference held on february   after a brief stay of the cases  the court declined to vacate its november th ruling and ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding the handling of plaintiffs individual claims and related matters 
plaintiffs subsequently filed a notice of appeal of the court s november th decision on february  we continue to believe the court s ruling was correct and will defend that ruling on appeal 
two other matters filed as proposed class actions pagaduan v 
fountain valley regional medical center  which was originally filed in orange county superior court  but has since been coordinated with the mcdonough and tien cases in los angeles superior court  and falck v 
tenet healthcare corporation  pending in us district court for the central district of california involve allegations regarding unpaid overtime 
these lawsuits allege that our pay practices since for california based hour shift employees violate california and  in the falck case  federal overtime laws by virtue of the alleged failure to include certain payments known as flexible or california differential payments in the regular rate of pay that is used to calculate overtime pay 
these payments are made to hour shift employees when they do not work a shift that is exactly hours 
we contend that these differential payments need only be included in the regular rate of pay when they actually are paid as opposed to merely being potentially payable  and that they always are included in the regular rate calculation in these circumstances 
plaintiffs in both cases have sought back pay  statutory penalties  interest and attorneys fees 
in february  the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in the pagaduan case 
separately  the falck case  which was first provisionally certified as a collective action under the federal fair labor standards act for the purpose of giving notice to potential class members  was certified as a class action for all purposes in february on september   a tentative settlement was reached in both the pagaduan and falck cases 
the parties subsequently entered into a stipulation of settlement 
the settlement  which will be administered by the los angeles superior court  was preliminarily approved on december  under the terms of the settlement  our liability will be not be less than million  but will not exceed million  subject to minor adjustment by the court 
the final approval hearing for the settlement is scheduled for may  internal revenue service disputes from time to time  we are engaged in disputes with the internal revenue service regarding our federal tax returns

lowman v 
hilton head medical center and clinics  et al  case no 
pmd us district court for the district of south carolina on november   the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit in richmond  virginia affirmed the trial court s decision to dismiss this qui tam case  which was originally filed under seal in september  then unsealed in july after the department of justice declined to intervene in the matter 
the suit was brought against the company  our hilton head medical center and clinics in south carolina and related subsidiaries  as well as a cardiologist who formerly practiced at hilton head 
the relator  a physician no longer on hilton head s medical staff  alleged under the federal false claims act that we received inappropriate payments from medicare for certain cardiac catheterization procedures that were performed by the cardiologist from through  during which time hilton head did not have a state certificate of need for open heart surgery capability  which was required under south carolina regulations for facilities performing those procedures 
the suit also alleged that certain of the catheterization procedures were medically unnecessary  although the relator provided no specific information regarding these claims 
the trial court granted our motion to dismiss in april as stated above  the relator s appeal to the fourth circuit was unsuccessful 
a subsequent request for reconsideration was also denied 
this matter is now concluded 
boca raton community hospital  inc v 
tenet healthcare corporation  case no 
civ us district court for the southern district of florida  filed march  plaintiff filed a civil complaint in federal district court in miami in march on behalf of itself and a purported class consisting of most of the acute care hospitals in the united states 
several of plaintiff s initial claims were withdrawn or dismissed  however  plaintiff continued to allege that tenet s past pricing policies and receipt of medicare outlier payments violated the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico  causing harm to plaintiff 
plaintiff sought unspecified amounts of damages including treble damages under rico  restitution  disgorgement and punitive damages 
in december  the district court denied plaintiff s motion for class certification  which decision the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit declined to review 
in august  the district court granted our motion for summary judgment on all claims  thereby dismissing this case 
plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of intent to appeal the district court s dismissal to the eleventh circuit  which heard oral arguments in the matter on january  we continue to believe that the trial court s decision was correct and are awaiting the eleventh circuit s decision on the appeal 
civil lawsuit involving real property university of southern california v 
usc university hospital  inc  et al  case no 
bc los angeles superior court  filed august  in august  the university of southern california filed a lawsuit in los angeles superior court against a tenet subsidiary seeking to terminate a ground lease and a development and operating agreement between the university and our subsidiary  which built  owns and operates usc university hospital  an acute care hospital located on land leased from the university in los angeles 
the university s complaint alleged that the lease and operating agreement should be terminated as a result of a default by our subsidiary and sought a judicial declaration terminating the agreements in an effort to force our subsidiary to sell the hospital to the university 
we strongly dispute the university s claims and sought to compel arbitration of the matter as we believe is mandated by the development and operating agreement 
in december  the trial court denied our motion to compel arbitration  and that decision was upheld by an appellate court in august the case returned to the trial court in november the university has filed an amended complaint  which modifies its claims to permit rather than require the university to terminate the lease and operating agreement upon a finding of default 
we moved to dismiss and  in the alternative  moved to strike portions of the university s amended complaint 
we also filed a cross complaint in november  asserting claims against the university for breach of contract  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment  and declaratory relief 
the university moved to dismiss our cross complaint 
at a hearing held on february   the court denied all of the pending motions 
in april  we announced that we had signed a non binding letter of intent for the university to acquire usc university hospital and usc kenneth norris jr 
cancer hospital  our bed facility specializing in cancer treatment on the campus of usc university hospital  in an effort to resolve the pending claims by both parties without protracted litigation 
on february   we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement with the university for the sale of the two facilities 
the transaction  which is targeted for completion by march   is subject to conditions and regulatory approvals that must be satisfied prior to closing 
in the event the sale is not consummated  we intend both to continue to vigorously defend this matter and to pursue our counterclaims against the university 

table of contents medical malpractice and other ordinary course matters in addition to the matters described above  our hospitals are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
most of these matters involve allegations of medical malpractice or other injuries suffered at our hospitals 
as previously reported  three such cases were filed as purported class action lawsuits and involve patients of our former memorial medical center and lindy boggs medical center in new orleans 
on september   class certification was granted in two of these suits preston  et al 
v 
memorial medical center and husband et al 
v 
memorial medical center 
in her order  the judge certified a class of all persons at memorial during and in the days following hurricane katrina  excluding employees  who sustained injuries or died  as well as family members who themselves sustained injury as a result of such injuries or deaths to any person at memorial  excluding employees  during that time 
we have filed an appeal of this decision with the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal 
in the remaining case  family members allege  on behalf of themselves and a purported class of other patients and their family members  similar damages as a result of injuries sustained at lindy boggs medical center during the aftermath of hurricane katrina 
the certification hearing in that matter has not yet been scheduled 
in addition to disputing the merits of the allegations in each of these suits  we contend that none of the actions meet the proper legal requirements for class actions and that each case must be adjudicated independently 
we will  therefore  continue to oppose class certification and vigorously defend the hospitals in these matters

significant challenges as stated above  there are significant industry wide challenges that have been impacting our operating performance 
below is a summary of these items 
volumes although we have seen some improvements in recent quarters  we have experienced declines in patient volumes over the last several years 
we believe the reasons for these declines include  but are not limited to  factors that have affected many hospital companies  including decreases in the demand for invasive cardiac procedures  increased competition and managed care contract negotiations or terminations 
given our geographic concentration  we are also affected by population trends  which have been a particular concern in florida 
in addition  we believe the industry wide challenges associated with physician recruitment  retention and attrition have also been significant contributors to our past volume declines 
our operations depend on the efforts  abilities and experience of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals  most of whom have no contractual relationship with us 
it is essential to our ongoing business that we attract and retain an appropriate number of quality physicians in all specialties on our medical staffs 
although we had a net overall gain in physicians added to our medical staffs during and  in some of our markets  physician recruitment and retention are still affected by a shortage of physicians in certain sought after specialties and the difficulties that physicians experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance or finding insurers willing to provide such insurance 
other issues facing physicians  such as proposed decreases in medicare payments  are forcing them to consider alternatives  including relocating their practices or retiring sooner than expected 
in some of our markets  we have not been able to attract physicians to our medical staffs at a rate to offset the physicians relocating or retiring 

table of contents we continue to take steps to increase patient volumes  however  due to the concentration of our hospitals in california  florida and texas  we may not be able to mitigate some factors that contribute to volume declines 
one of our initiatives is our physician relationship program  which is centered around understanding the needs of physicians who admit patients both to our hospitals and to our competitors hospitals and responding to those needs with changes and improvements in our hospitals and operations 
we have targeted capital spending in order to address specific needs or growth opportunities of our hospitals  which is expected to have a positive impact on their volumes 
we have also sought to include all of our hospitals in the affected geographic area or nationally when negotiating new managed care contracts  which should result in additional volumes at facilities that were not previously a part of such managed care networks 
in addition  we have been completing clinical service line market demand analyses and profitability assessments to determine which services are highly valued that can be emphasized and marketed to improve our operating results 
this targeted growth initiative has resulted in some reductions in unprofitable service lines in several locations  which have had a slightly negative impact on our volumes 
however  the elimination of these unprofitable service lines will allow us to focus more resources on services that are more profitable 
our commitment to quality initiative is further helping position us to competitively meet the volume challenge 
we continue to work with physicians to implement the most current evidence based techniques to improve the way we provide care 
as a result of these efforts  our hospitals have improved substantially in quality metrics reported by the government and have been recognized by several managed care companies for their quality of care 
we believe that quality of care improvements will continue to have the effect of increasing physician and patient satisfaction  potentially improving our volumes as a result 
bad debt like other organizations in the health care industry  we continue to provide services to a high volume of uninsured patients and more patients than in prior years with an increased burden of co payments and deductibles as a result of changes in their health care plans 
the discounting components of our compact with uninsured patients compact have reduced our provision for doubtful accounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  but they do not mitigate the net economic effects of treating uninsured or underinsured patients 
we continue to experience a high level of uncollectible accounts 
our collection efforts have improved  and we continue to focus  where applicable  on placement of patients in various government programs such as medicaid 
however  unless our business mix shifts toward a greater number of insured patients or the trend of higher co payments and deductibles reverses  we anticipate this high level of uncollectible accounts to continue 
cost pressures labor and supply expenses remain a significant cost pressure facing us as well as the industry in general 
controlling labor costs in an environment of fluctuating patient volumes and increased labor union activity will continue to be a challenge 
also  inflation and technology improvements are driving supply costs higher  and our efforts to control supply costs through product standardization  bulk purchases and improved utilization are constantly challenged 
general economic conditions the current economic downturn  tightening in the credit markets  and instability in the banking and financial institution industries has not yet had a direct material impact on our volumes  but has affected our ability to collect outstanding receivables 
in addition  a significant amount of our admissions comes through our emergency rooms and  therefore  is not usually materially impacted by broad economic factors 
however  our levels of elective procedures and our ability to collect accounts receivable  due to the related effects of higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care enrollment  may be materially impacted if the current economic environment continues 
we could also be negatively affected if california  florida or other states reduce funding of medicaid and other state healthcare programs 

table of contents results of operations overview our results of operations have been and continue to be influenced by industry wide challenges  including fluctuating volumes  decreased demand for inpatient cardiac procedures and high levels of bad debt  that have negatively affected our revenue growth and operating expenses 
we believe our future profitability will be achieved through volume growth  appropriate reimbursement levels and cost control across our portfolio of hospitals 
because we believe our results of operations for our most recent fiscal quarter best reflect the trends we are currently experiencing with respect to volumes  revenues and expenses  we have provided below detailed information about these metrics for the three months ended december  and in order to disclose trends using data comparable to the prior year  operating statistics in this section and throughout management s discussion and analysis are presented on a same hospital basis  where noted  and exclude the results of coastal carolina medical center and sierra providence east medical center  for which we did not yet have a full calendar year of operating results at the beginning of the three months ended december  same hospital continuing operations three months ended december  admissions  patient days and surgeries increase decrease commercial managed care admissions governmental managed care admissions medicare admissions medicaid admissions uninsured admissions charity care admissions other admissions total admissions paying admissions excludes charity and uninsured charity admissions and uninsured admissions admissions through emergency department commercial managed care admissions as a percentage of total admissions emergency department admissions as a percentage of total admissions uninsured admissions as a percentage of total admissions charity admissions as a percentage of total admissions surgeries inpatient surgeries outpatient total surgeries patient days total adjusted patient days patient days commercial managed care average length of stay days adjusted patient admissions the change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  adjusted patient days admissions represents actual patient days admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues 
our florida and central regions achieved the strongest admissions growth in the three months ended december   and our central region achieved its second highest growth of the year in that period 
our california region experienced a decline in admissions in the three months ended december   which was its only negative growth of the year 
both our southern states region and our philadelphia market had admissions declines during the period 
while total same hospital admissions declined by in the three months ended december   paying admissions grew by 
there was also a decline in uninsured and charity admissions 
commercial managed care admissions declined by compared to the three months ended december   but improved relative to the year over year decline reported in the three months ended september  a decline in obstetrics volumes accounted for of our decline in commercial managed care admissions in the three months ended december  compared to the same period in under our targeted growth 
table of contents initiative  we have deemphasized the obstetrics service line in a significant number of hospitals 
surgery growth remained strong in the three months ended december   supported by growth in outpatient surgeries of 
inpatient surgeries were flat relative to the three months ended december  our targeted growth initiative brought incremental focus to a number of the service lines that contributed to this growth in surgeries 
same hospital continuing operations three months ended december  outpatient visits increase decrease total visits paying visits excludes charity and uninsured uninsured visits uninsured visits as a percentage of total visits charity care visits charity care visits as a percentage of total visits surgery visits commercial managed care visits commercial visits as a percentage of total visits the change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  while total same hospital outpatient visits declined by in the three months ended december   paying outpatient visits which excludes uninsured and charity outpatient visits increased by in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in competition from physician owned enterprises offering outpatient services continues to restrain our growth in outpatient volumes 
our recent acquisitions of outpatient facilities added  outpatient visits in the three months ended december  and was more than offset by  lost visits resulting from recent divestitures and the joint venturing of some of our existing outpatient facilities where we took a minority interest 
excluding the impact of this resultant net loss of  outpatient visits from acquisitions and divestitures  outpatient visits in the three months ended december  would have declined by  visits  or 
same hospital continuing operations three months ended december  revenues increase decrease net operating revenues net patient revenue from commercial managed care revenues from the uninsured net operating revenues in the three months ended december  include million from the partial reversal of a million unfavorable adjustment recorded in the three months ended june  related to a graduate medical education reimbursement dispute at one of our california hospitals 
excluding this million from net operating revenues for the three months ended december   net operating revenues would have increased by million  or  compared to the three months ended december  as the charge reversal was recorded in other revenue  our patient pricing statistics for the three months ended december  were unaffected 
prior year cost report adjustments contributed million to net operating revenues in the three months ended december  prior year cost report adjustments made no contribution to net operating revenues in the three months ended december  
table of contents same hospital continuing operations three months ended december  revenues on a per patient day  per admission and per visit basis increase decrease net inpatient revenue per admission net inpatient revenue per patient day net outpatient revenue per visit net patient revenue per adjusted patient admission net patient revenue per adjusted patient day managed care net inpatient revenue per admission managed care net outpatient revenue per visit adjusted patient days admissions represents actual patient days admissions adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days admissions by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues 
pricing improvement was evident across all key metrics  primarily reflecting the improved terms of our commercial managed care contracts 
outpatient pricing again outpaced the growth in inpatient pricing due to an improving mix of procedures performed in our outpatient facilities 
our investment and development of higher end procedures in both the surgery and imaging areas of our outpatient business  as well as recent acquisitions  have contributed to this improving mix 
same hospital continuing operations three months ended december  selected operating expenses increase decrease salaries  wages and benefits supplies other operating expenses total rent lease expense salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day supplies per adjusted patient day other operating expenses per adjusted patient day total per adjusted patient day included in other operating expenses 
adjusted patient days represent actual patient days adjusted to include outpatient services by multiplying actual patient days by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and outpatient revenues and dividing the results by gross inpatient revenues 
on a per adjusted patient day basis  salaries  wages and benefits increased in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees and increased health benefits costs  partially offset by a decline in full time employee headcount  reduced contract labor expense  improved worker s compensation loss experience and lower incentive compensation costs 
contract labor expense  which is included in salaries  wages and benefits  was million in the three months ended december   a decrease of million  or  as compared to the same period in supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased by in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase in supplies expense is primarily due to the increased number of surgeries as well as the use of certain new  higher cost drugs 
a portion of the increase in supplies expense relates to revenue growth for increased reimbursements from certain payers 
other operating expenses per adjusted patient day decreased by in the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in included in this decrease was a significant decline in malpractice expense 
on a total hospital basis  malpractice expense declined to million in the three months ended december  from million in the same period in  a decline of million or 
this decrease is primarily attributable to improved claims experience and was partially offset by million of incremental expenses related to a lower interest rate environment that increased the discounted present value of projected future liabilities 
other operating expenses were also impacted by higher physician fees reflecting increases in emergency department on call payments  increases in costs of contracted services  as well as repair and maintenance costs 
declining consulting costs also had a favorable impact on other operating expenses 

table of contents same hospital continuing operations three months ended december  provision for doubtful accounts increase decrease provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues collection rate from self pay collection rate from managed care payers the change is the difference between the amounts shown for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  provision for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  despite declines in uninsured admissions and outpatient visits of and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts resulted from the decline in our self pay collection rate  which decreased to approximately from in the in the three months ended december   higher pricing  higher patient insurance deductibles  and a favorable adjustment to provision for doubtful accounts in that did not recur 
cash flow data for the three months ended december  cash and cash equivalents were million at december   a decrease of million from million at september  significant cash flow items in the three months ended december  included capital expenditures of million  consisting of million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations  interest payments of million  million in principal payments excluding interest of million classified as operating cash outflows from continuing operations related to our civil settlement with the federal government  a million decline in the cash and cash equivalents balance related to our medicare health maintenance organization insurance subsidiary operating in louisiana  primarily due to the timing of monthly payments from the centers for medicare and medicaid services  which is classified as a discontinued operations cash outflow from operations  cash distributions of million we received related to our investment in the reserve yield plus fund  which are classified as investing activity cash flows  and insurance recoveries of million related to our december redding medical center litigation settlement  based on the components of the recoveries  million was classified as operating cash flows from continuing operations and million was classified as operating cash flows from discontinued operations 
sources of revenue we receive revenues for patient services from a variety of sources  primarily managed care payers and the federal medicare program  as well as state medicaid programs  indemnity based health insurance companies and self pay patients ie  patients who do not have health insurance and are not covered by some other form of third party arrangement 

table of contents the table below shows the sources of net patient revenues on a same hospital basis  expressed as percentages of net patient revenues from all sources years ended december  net patient revenues from medicare medicaid managed care governmental managed care commercial indemnity  self pay and other our payer mix on a same hospital admissions basis  expressed as a percentage of total admissions from all sources  is shown below years ended december  admissions from medicare medicaid managed care governmental managed care commercial indemnity  self pay and other the increase in managed care governmental admissions is primarily due to a shift from traditional government programs to managed government programs 
government programs the medicare program  the nation s largest health insurance program  is administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms of the us department of health and human services hhs 
medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals years of age and older  certain younger people with disabilities  and people with end stage renal disease  and is provided without regard to income or assets 
medicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources  and is jointly funded by the federal government and state governments 
medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health related services for the nation s poor and most vulnerable individuals 
these government programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the cost of providing services to our patients and the timing of payments to our facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited  or if we or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents medicare medicare offers its beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits 
one option  the original medicare plan  is a fee for service payment system 
the other option  called medicare advantage  includes health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations  private fee for service medicare special needs plans and medicare medical savings account plans 
the major components of our net patient revenues for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan for the years ended december   and are set forth in the table below years ended december  revenue descriptions diagnosis related group operating diagnosis related group capital outlier outpatient disproportionate share direct graduate and indirect medical education other adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances total medicare net patient revenues the other revenue category includes one skilled nursing facility  inpatient psychiatric units  one inpatient rehabilitation hospital  inpatient rehabilitation units  one long term acute care hospital  other revenue adjustments  and adjustments related to the estimates for current year cost reports and related valuation allowances 
a general description of the types of payments we receive for services provided to patients enrolled in the original medicare plan is provided below 
recent regulatory and legislative updates to the terms of these payment systems and their estimated effect on our revenues can be found under regulatory and legislative changes 
acute care hospital inpatient prospective payment system medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group payments sections d and g of the social security act the act set forth a system of payments for the operating and capital costs of inpatient acute care hospital admissions based on a prospective payment system 
under the inpatient prospective payment system ipps  medicare payments for hospital inpatient operating services are made at predetermined rates for each hospital discharge 
discharges are classified according to a system of medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related groups ms drgs  which categorize patients with similar clinical characteristics that are expected to require similar amounts of hospital resources 
cms assigns to each ms drg a relative weight that represents the average resources required to treat cases in that particular ms drg  relative to the average resources used to treat cases in all ms drgs 
the base payment amount for the operating component of the ms drg payment is comprised of an average standardized amount that is divided into a labor related share and a nonlabor related share 
both the labor related share of operating base payments and the base payment amount for capital costs are adjusted for geographic variations in labor and capital costs  respectively 
these base payments are multiplied by the relative weight of the ms drg assigned to each case 
the ms drg operating and capital base rates  relative weights and geographic adjustment factors are updated annually  with consideration given to the increased cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals  the relative costs associated with each ms drg  and changes in labor data by geographic area 
although these payments are adjusted for area labor and capital cost differentials  the adjustments do not take into consideration an individual hospital s operating and capital costs 
outlier payments outlier payments are additional payments made to hospitals for treating medicare patients who are costlier to treat than the average patient in the same ms drg 
to qualify as a cost outlier  a hospital s billed charges  adjusted to cost  must exceed the payment rate for the ms drg by a fixed threshold established annually by cms 
the medicare fiscal intermediary calculates the cost of a claim by multiplying the billed charges by a cost to charge ratio that is typically based on the hospital s most recent filed cost report 
generally  if the computed cost exceeds the sum of the ms drg payment plus the fixed threshold  the hospital receives of the difference as an outlier payment 
under the act  cms must project aggregate annual outlier payments to all prospective payment system pps hospitals to be not less than or more than of total ms drg payments outlier percentage 
the outlier percentage is 
table of contents determined by dividing total outlier payments by the sum of ms drg and outlier payments 
cms annually adjusts the fixed threshold to bring projected outlier payments within the mandated limit 
a change to the fixed threshold affects total outlier payments by changing the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments  and the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that still qualify 
disproportionate share hospital payments in addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries  medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately high share of low income patients 
disproportionate share hospital dsh payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information defined by cms and are calculated as a percentage add on to the ms drg payments 
this percentage varies  depending on several factors that include the percentage of low income patients served 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations qualified for dsh payments 
direct graduate and indirect medical education the medicare program provides additional reimbursement to approved teaching hospitals for additional expenses incurred by such institutions 
this additional reimbursement  which is subject to certain limits  including intern and resident full time equivalent fte limits established in  is made in the form of direct graduate medical education gme and indirect medical education ime payments 
during  of our hospitals in continuing operations were affiliated with academic institutions and were eligible to receive such payments 
medicare rules permit hospitals to enter into medicare gme affiliation agreements for the purpose of applying the fte limits on an aggregate basis  and some of our hospitals have entered into such agreements 
we have been contacted by cms in connection with gme fte limits and related reimbursement at doctors medical center in modesto  california as a result of our transaction with a county owned hospital in modesto 
we have annually collected approximately million of gme reimbursement at the hospital 
we replied to cms that  based on our analysis of the transaction and the applicable cms rules  we believe that the gme fte limits and related reimbursement reported on the hospital s cost reports were substantially correct 
in january  cms preliminarily advised us that they disagree with our analysis 
during the three months ended june   we submitted additional information to cms regarding the original transaction 
cms subsequently contacted us and stated that they continue to disagree with our analysis  and they instructed our fiscal intermediary to reopen settled cost reports to recover ime and gme payments made to the hospital 
during the three months ended september   we submitted additional information for cms consideration 
also during the three months ended september   we received notices from our fiscal intermediary of its intent to reopen certain cost reports in connection with this matter 
we have since received settlement notices for the hospital s through cost reporting periods that reflect a disallowance of all of the hospital s ime and gme payments  and the hospital s cost report was filed consistent with the fiscal intermediary s disallowance on the prior year cost reports 
additionally  the fiscal intermediary ceased making ime and gme interim payments to the hospital for current and future services 
although we are pursuing a reversal of cms decision  the outcome is uncertain at this time 
as a result  in the three months ended june   we recorded an unfavorable adjustment of million million related to prior years and million related to the current year  and we have not subsequently recorded any ime or gme revenue for this hospital 
during the three months ended december   stanislaus county confirmed its obligation with respect to a residency program funding grant agreement between doctors medical center and the county  as a result  we recorded an million receivable for that additional grant funding 
hospital outpatient prospective payment system under the outpatient prospective payment system  hospital outpatient services  except for certain services that are reimbursed on a separate fee schedule  are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications apcs 
services in each apc are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require  and a payment rate is established for each apc 
depending on the services provided  hospitals may be paid for more than one apc for an encounter 
cms periodically updates the apcs and annually adjusts the rates paid for each apc 
inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system the inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system ipf pps applies to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units located within acute care hospitals that have been designated as exempt from the hospital inpatient prospective payment system 
the ipf pps includes several provisions to ease the transition to this system from the previous cost based system 
for example  cms phased in the ipf pps for existing hospitals and units over a three year period to avoid disrupting the delivery of inpatient psychiatric services 
all of our hospitals psychiatric units transitioned to the ipf pps on or before june  the ipf pps  which is based on prospectively determined per diem rates  includes a stop loss provision to protect providers against significant losses during the transition period  and an outlier policy that authorizes additional payments for extraordinarily costly cases 

table of contents inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment system rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation units in acute care hospitals meeting certain criteria established by cms are eligible to be paid as an inpatient rehabilitation facility irf under the irf prospective payment system irf pps 
payments under the irf pps are made on a per discharge basis 
a patient classification system is used to assign patients in irfs into case mix groups 
the irf pps uses federal prospective payment rates across distinct case mix groups 
prior to july   a rehabilitation hospital or unit was eligible for classification as an irf if it could show that  during its most recent month cost reporting period  it served an inpatient population of which at least percent of the patients required intensive rehabilitation services for the treatment of one or more of ten specific conditions 
this became known as the percent rule 
on may   cms released a final rule entitled medicare program  changes to the criteria for being classified as an inpatient rehabilitation facility that revised the medical condition criteria rehabilitation hospitals and units must meet 
this rule also replaced the percent rule compliance threshold with a three year transition compliance threshold of  and for years one  two and three  respectively  then a return to in year four  commencing with cost reporting periods beginning on or after july  the three year transition period was later delayed by one year  and then was permanently set at in see regulatory and legislative changes below 
as of december   our inpatient rehabilitation hospital and all of our rehabilitation units were in compliance with the required compliance threshold 
cost reports the final determination of certain medicare payments to our hospitals  such as dsh  gme  ime and bad debt expense  are retrospectively determined based on our hospitals cost reports 
the final determination of these payments often takes many years to resolve because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal  and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
for filed cost reports  we adjust the accrual for estimated cost report settlements based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for estimated cost report settlements for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
medicaid medicaid programs are funded by both the federal government and state governments 
these programs and the reimbursement methodologies are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year 
estimated payments under various state medicaid programs  excluding state funded managed care medicaid programs  constituted approximately  and of net patient revenues at our continuing general hospitals for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these payments are typically based on fixed rates determined by the individual states 
we also receive dsh payments under various state medicaid programs 
for the years ended december   and  our revenue attributable to dsh payments and other state funded subsidy payments was approximately million million  and million  respectively 

table of contents medicaid patient revenues by state for the year ended december  are set forth in the table below year ended december  florida california georgia missouri pennsylvania texas south carolina nebraska north carolina alabama louisiana tennessee several states in which we operate have recently faced budgetary challenges that resulted in reduced medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers 
further  although most states addressed projected budgetary gaps in their final budgets  because of the recent economic downturn  many states are facing mid year budget gaps that could result in additional reductions to medicaid payments  coverage and eligibility or additional taxes on hospitals 
based on a recent report  at least states are projecting budget shortfalls in their and or budgets 
for example in florida  the legislature held a special session in january to address the state s budget deficit and proposed several changes for consideration in the full legislative session that commenced february  if enacted as proposed  the changes would result in a across the board reduction in medicaid rates effective july  we estimate that the annual impact of these changes on our florida hospitals revenues would be a reduction of approximately million to million in on september   the governor of california signed into law a budget containing more than million in reductions to medi cal  the state s medicaid program  for the fiscal year beginning july  under the budget  a reduction to certain medi cal provider payments is in effect until march   when the reduction will be reduced to 
at this time  we estimate that these payment reductions will reduce our revenues by approximately million in the reductions also apply to capitation payments to medi cal managed care plans  however  we cannot estimate at this time what impact the reductions will have on such payments 
in addition to provider payment reductions  the budget includes payment deferrals and reductions in coverage 
on december   a new budget plan for california was released to address budget deficits in the current year as well as the new fiscal year beginning july  the new plan includes a one month payment deferral in in addition to the previous payment deferral already budgeted  elimination of some benefits and further reductions in coverage 
at this time  we cannot estimate the impact on our revenues from these proposed budget cuts 
further  we cannot predict the extent of the impact on our hospitals of future actions the states might take to address additional budgetary shortfalls 
although legislation has been introduced to provide additional federal funding to states facing budgetary shortfalls  we cannot predict what action congress will take on the legislation and the impact  if any  of such legislation on our hospitals 
in may  cms issued a final rule  medicaid program  cost limit for providers operated by units of government and provisions to ensure the integrity of the federal state financial partnership  that places limits and restrictions on medicaid reimbursement to safety net hospitals 
a one year moratorium on implementation of the final rule was included in the federal fiscal year ffy supplemental appropriations act  which meant that the rule could not take effect before may  on may   cms announced that it was voluntarily extending the moratorium for an additional days  then in june the moratorium was extended through march  as part of the ffy supplemental appropriations act 
congress is currently considering legislation that would extend the moratorium until june  we cannot predict what further action  if any  congress or cms may take to extend the moratorium or implement the final rule 
however  the provisions of the rule could materially reduce the amount of medicaid payments we receive in the future 

table of contents also in may  cms issued a proposed rule clarifying that the agency would no longer provide federal medicaid matching funds for gme purposes  however  the ffy supplemental appropriations act contained language that placed a one year moratorium on any such restriction 
the moratorium was scheduled to expire on may  on may   cms announced that it was voluntarily extending the moratorium for an additional days  then in june the moratorium was extended through march  as part of the ffy supplemental appropriations act 
congress is currently considering legislation that would extend the moratorium until june  annual medicaid gme payments to our hospitals are approximately million 
we cannot predict what further action  if any  congress or cms will take on this issue 
regulatory and legislative changes recent regulatory and legislative updates to the medicare and medicaid payment systems are provided below 
annual update to the medicare inpatient prospective payment system under medicare law  cms is required annually to update certain rules governing the inpatient prospective payment system 
the updates generally become effective october  the beginning of the federal fiscal year 
on july   cms issued the final changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and ffy rates final rule 
the final rule includes the following payment and policy changes a market basket increase of for ms drg operating payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data hospitals that do not report specified quality measure data will receive an increase of a increase in the capital federal ms drg rate  an increase in the number of quality measures hospitals would need to report in ffy in order to qualify for the full market basket update from in ffy to in ffy  an across the board reduction of as required by the transitional medical assistance  abstinence education  and qualifying individuals programs extension act of to offset the effect of changes in documentation and or coding or the classification of discharges that do not reflect real changes in case mix  further implementation of a provision of the deficit reduction act of preventing medicare from giving hospitals higher payments for the additional costs of treating a patient that acquires a condition including an infection during a hospital stay by adding three hospital acquired conditions  and a decrease in the cost outlier threshold from  to  which was later further reduced to  as described below 
as a result of recent legislation affecting wage index reclassifications  cms did not have sufficient time between the passage of the legislation and the deadline for publication of the final rule to recalculate wage indices based on the new reclassification data 
on september   cms issued the final ffy rates notice rate notice  which contains the final ffy wage indices and payment rates 
in addition to revising the wage indices and standardized amounts  the cost outlier threshold was further reduced to cms projects that the combined impact of the final payment and policy changes will yield an average increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas populations over million 
this includes cms estimate of a increase in payments resulting from improved coding and documentation 
based on an analysis of the payment and policy changes in the final rule  including the impact of the rate notice  as applied to our hospitals  the estimated annual impact is an increase in our medicare inpatient revenues of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty of other factors that may influence our future ipps payments by individual hospital  including admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
in addition to the across the board reduction described above  the transitional medical assistance  abstinence education  and qualifying individuals programs extension act of specifies that  to the extent the documentation and coding adjustments applied in ffy and ffy result in overpayments or underpayments relative to the actual amount of documentation and coding related increases  cms shall correct the overpayments and underpayments in fiscal years a determination of overpayment will result in a reduction of medicare inpatient payments in those years 
we expect cms to address the documentation and coding adjustments in the ffy proposed rule to be issued during  however  we cannot predict at this time how cms will conduct the final analysis or the outcome of the final determination  or estimate the potential impact on our revenues 

table of contents payment and policy changes to the medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system on july   cms issued the final rule for the medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system for ffy irf pps final rule 
the irf pps final rule includes the following payment and policy changes an increase in the outlier threshold for high cost outlier cases from  to  and an update to the case mix group relative weights and average length of stay values using ffy data 
cms is also implementing the following statutorily mandated provisions of the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of a compliance threshold held at for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july   a continuation of counting comorbidities when determining an irf s compliance with the threshold  and an update to the irf pps payment rate equal to effective for discharges beginning on and after april  through ffy at december   we operated one inpatient rehabilitation hospital  and of our general hospitals in continuing operations operated inpatient rehabilitation units 
cms projects that the payment and policy changes will result in an estimated total decrease in aggregate irf payments of million or of total irf pps payments for ffy this decrease is due to the update to the outlier threshold amount to reduce estimated outlier payments from for ffy to for ffy we do not believe that the statutorily mandated or irf pps final rule changes will have a material impact on our net operating revenues 
because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future irf payments  including admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  and the impact of compliance with the irf admission criteria  we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes 
payment changes to the medicare inpatient psychiatric facility prospective payment system on may   cms issued a notice of the medicare inpatient psychiatric facility ipf prospective payment system update for the rate year beginning july  ipf pps notice

cms projects that the combined impact of the payment changes will yield an average increase in payments for all ipfs including psychiatric units in acute care hospitals  and an average increase in payments for psychiatric units of acute care hospitals located in urban areas 
using the urban unit impact percentage as applied to our medicare ipf payments for the months ended june   we do not believe the payment changes will have a material impact on our net operating revenues 
because of the uncertainty of the factors that may influence our future ipf payments  including admission volumes  length of stay and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding our estimate of the impact of these changes 

table of contents payment and policy changes to the medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system on october   cms issued the final changes to the hospital outpatient prospective payment system and calendar year payment rates opps final rule 
the opps final rule includes the following payment and policy changes a inflation update in medicare payment rates for hospital outpatient services paid under the outpatient prospective payment system opps  for purposes of the calendar year cy update  an increase in the number of measures that hospitals are required to report to receive the full cy market basket update from four measures in cy to measures in cy  and making a single payment for multiple services of a particular type such as multiple ultrasound procedures performed in a single hospital session in addition to ultrasound  cms will apply this policy to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging services 
cms projects that the combined impact of the payment and policy changes in the opps final rule will yield an average increase in payments for all hospitals and an average increase in payments for hospitals in large urban areas populations over million 
according to the cms hospital specific opps final rule impact file  the increase in our medicare outpatient revenues is expected to be approximately million 
because of the uncertainty regarding other factors that may influence our future opps payments  including volumes and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate 
payments for emergency health services provided to undocumented aliens section of the medicare modernization act of provides million each year for ffys to eligible providers for emergency services furnished to undocumented and other specified aliens 
the statutory authorization for the funding of that program expired on september   although cms indicated that payments to providers would continue after that date until all allocated funds are exhausted 
the fiscal intermediary assigned to process the section claims recently announced that cms has approved payment for medical services delivered on or before march  congress considered legislation to provide additional funding for the program in  but ultimately took no action 
we cannot predict whether congress will provide new funding in or when currently allocated funds will be exhausted 
our hospitals received approximately million in section payments in calendar year tricare hospital outpatient prospective payment system tricare is the managed care component of the us department of defense dod military health system 
it provides benefits to active duty members of the united states armed services  including some national guard and reserve members  and military retirees  as well as their dependents 
tricare brings together the health care resources of the uniformed services and supplements them with networks of civilian health care professionals  institutions  pharmacies and suppliers 
in section of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year  congress mandated that tricare payment methods and amounts for institutional care should be determined  to the extent practicable  in accordance with the same reimbursement rules used by medicare 
medicare outpatient reimbursement amounts are generally lower than current tricare rates 
on december   the dod issued a final rule  with an effective date of january   to implement a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services under tricare that is modeled after the medicare outpatient prospective payment system 
in that final rule  the dod estimates that the tricare outpatient payment and policy changes will result in a reduction of approximately from current payment levels for urban hospitals 
we estimate that implementation of the new outpatient payment system could reduce annual tricare payments to our hospitals by approximately million 
on february   the dod released a rule that delays the effective date of the new tricare outpatient payment system until may  and invited additional public comment on the final rule 
because of uncertainty regarding the final rule and other factors that may influence our future tricare outpatient payments  including volumes and case mix  we cannot provide any assurances regarding this estimate

cms medicare value based purchasing program report congress  through section b of the deficit reduction act of  authorized the secretary of hhs to develop a plan to implement value based purchasing vbp commencing in ffy for medicare hospital services paid under the ipps 
by statute  the plan must include consideration of the development and selection of measures of quality and efficiency in inpatient settings  reporting  collection and validation of quality data  the structure  size and source of value based payment adjustments  and disclosure of information on hospital performance 
on november   cms issued a report to congress with its plan to implement a vbp program 
in the report  cms proposes to transform medicare from a passive payer of claims to an active purchaser of care 
the options in the report build on the foundation of the current program of reporting hospital quality data for the annual payment update  which ties a portion of the ipps annual payment update to a hospital meeting certain requirements  including reporting on a defined set of inpatient quality measures 
under cms proposal  its vbp program would phase out those requirements and would make a portion of a hospital s payments contingent on actual performance on specified measures  rather than simply on the hospital s reporting data for these measures 
under vbp  payments to high performing hospitals would be larger than those to lower performing hospitals because the ipps would be used to provide financial incentives to drive improvements in clinical quality  patient centeredness and efficiency 
public reporting of performance on medicare s hospital compare website  a key component of the current reporting program  would remain an essential component of vbp 
on september   the quality first act was introduced in the us house of representatives that would have established a program of performance based payment for medicare inpatient services starting in ffy  however  the th congress adjourned without taking action on the bill 
we cannot predict what action the new congress or cms under the new administration may take with respect to the development or implementation of a vbp program  nor can we predict at this time what impact  if any  a vbp program might have on our results of operations or cash flows 
medicare recovery audit contractor rac initiative section of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of directed the secretary of hhs to demonstrate the use of racs under cms medicare integrity program in identifying underpayments and overpayments under the medicare program  and recouping those overpayments 
racs are third party organizations under contract with cms  and the law provides that compensation paid to each rac be based on a percentage of overpayment recoveries identified by the rac 
the rac demonstration was slated to end in march  however  section of the tax relief and health care act of made the rac program permanent and instructed cms to use racs to identify medicare underpayments and overpayments nationwide by in november  cms released the revised rac statement of work sow 
the sow included several improvements  including placing certain restrictions on the claims subject to review by the racs  and it delayed implementation of the rac program in some states 
several of our hospitals included in the rac demonstration received notices of overpayments resulting from rac reviews 
the overpayment determinations are subject to reconsideration and appeal through various forums  and we will pursue the reversal of the determinations where appropriate  however  we cannot predict the outcome of the appeals 
in addition to overpayments identified by the racs that are not reversed  we will incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and pursue the reversal of payment denials 
on october   cms announced the names of the new national racs and according to cms timetable  the new racs were to begin reviews in december however  two unsuccessful bidders protested the awarding of the permanent contracts  and all rac activity was stopped pending a determination by the government accountability office gao 
in february  the two unsuccessful bidders withdrew their protests  and cms announced that it is taking steps to resume its rollout of the permanent rac program beginning march we cannot predict the impact of future rac reviews on our results of operations or cash flows 
medpac recommendations the medicare payment advisory commission medpac is an independent congressional agency established by the balanced budget act of to advise congress on issues affecting the medicare program 
the commission s statutory mandate is quite broad  in addition to advising congress on payments to private health plans participating in medicare and providers in medicare s traditional fee for service program  medpac is also tasked with analyzing access to care  quality of care and other issues affecting medicare 

table of contents on january   medpac voted on final recommendations for their march report to congress 
their final recommendations affecting hospital payments include the following congress should increase payment rates for the acute inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems for by the projected rate of increase in the hospital market basket index concurrent with the implementation of a quality program  and congress should reduce the ime adjustment in by to per increment in the resident to bed ratio  and the funds obtained by reducing the ime adjustment should be used to fund a quality incentive payment program 
we cannot predict what actions  if any  congress or cms may take with respect to medpac s recommendations or what impact those actions may have on our operations 
any actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
regulations addressing serious medical events in an effort to encourage hospitals to improve quality of care  the medicare program and certain state medicaid programs have taken steps to reduce or withhold payments to hospitals for treatment given to patients whose conditions were caused by serious medical error 
under rules that went into effect on october   medicare will no longer pay hospitals for the higher costs of care resulting from eight complications  including falls  objects left inside patients during surgery  pressure ulcers and three types of hospital acquired infections 
certain states have established policies or proposed legislation to prohibit hospitals from charging or receiving payment from their medicaid programs for highly preventable adverse medical events sometimes called serious reportable events or never events  which were developed by the national quality forum  a non profit organization that seeks to improve the quality of american healthcare 
also  some states impose fines and penalties on hospitals when these events occur 
serious reportable events include wrong site surgery  serious medication mistakes and discharging a baby to the wrong mother  among others 
hospitals in some states  including california  are required to report certain adverse events to a state agency charged with publicizing the events  as well as the results of any ensuing investigation conducted by the agency 
we believe that our commitment to quality initiative  which utilizes the most current evidence based techniques to improve the way we provide care  reduces our exposure to serious reportable events  but we are unable to predict the future impact of this development on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program schip extension act of the state children s health insurance program provides health insurance to poor children 
schip is jointly financed  under the provisions of the social security act  by federal and state governments and administered by the states 
within broad federal guidelines  each state determines the design of its program  eligibility groups  benefit packages  payment levels for coverage  and administrative and operating procedures 
schip provided a capped amount of funds to states on a matching basis through september   when it expired 
the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of  which was signed into law on december   extended funding through march  on february   the president signed the state children s health insurance program bill  which extends the schip program by years and expands the program to an additional million children 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   the president signed the american recovery and reinvestment act of into law

table of contents billion in state fiscal relief  which includes billion for a temporary month increase in the federal medical assistance percentage the rate at which the federal government matches states medicaid expenditures  and a increase in the states fiscal year and dsh payments that would revert to of the payments under current law  and billion in new spending on health information technology  most of which is for incentive payments to physicians and hospitals  which the congressional budget office assumes will generate billion in savings over time  and billion for health information technology grants 
we cannot predict how or when these measures will be implemented 
we also cannot predict what impact any of the measures might have on our results of operations or cash flows 
private insurance managed care we currently have thousands of managed care contracts with various health maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos 
hmos generally maintain a full service health care delivery network comprised of physician  hospital  pharmacy and ancillary service providers that hmo members must access through an assigned primary care physician 
the member s care is then managed by his or her primary care physician and other network providers in accordance with the hmo s quality assurance and utilization review guidelines so that appropriate health care can be efficiently delivered in the most cost effective manner 
hmos typically provide no benefit or reimbursement to their members who use non contracted health care providers for non emergency care 
ppos generally offer limited benefits to members who use non contracted health care providers 
ppo members who use contracted health care providers receive a preferred benefit  typically in the form of lower co payments  co insurance or deductibles 
as employers and employees have demanded more choice  managed care plans have developed hybrid products that combine elements of both hmo and ppo plans 
the amount of our managed care net patient revenues during the years ended december   and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
approximately of our managed care net patient revenues for the year ended december  was derived from our top ten managed care payers 
national payers generate approximately of our total net managed care revenues 
the remainder comes from regional or local payers 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from managed care payers 
we expect managed care governmental admissions to continue to increase as a percentage of total managed care admissions over the near term 
however  the managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans typically generate lower yields than commercial managed care plans  which have been experiencing an improved pricing trend 
although we have had fourteen consecutive quarters of improved year over year managed care pricing  we expect some moderation in the pricing percentage increases in the future 
through the year ended december   our commercial managed care net inpatient revenue per admission from our acute care hospitals was approximately higher than our aggregate yield on a per admission basis from government payers  including managed medicare and medicaid insurance plans 
indemnity an indemnity based agreement generally requires the insurer to reimburse an insured patient for health care expenses after those expenses have been incurred by the patient  subject to an increasing number of policy conditions and exclusions 
unlike an hmo member  a patient with indemnity insurance is free to control his or her utilization of health care and selection of health care providers 
self pay patients self pay patients are patients who do not qualify for government programs payments  such as medicare and medicaid  and who do not have some form of private insurance and  therefore  are responsible for their own medical bills 
a significant 
table of contents portion of our self pay patients is being admitted through our hospitals emergency departments and often requires high acuity treatment 
high acuity treatment is more costly to provide and  therefore  results in higher billings  which are the least collectible of all accounts 
we believe our level of self pay patients has been higher in the last several years than previous periods due to a combination of broad economic factors  including reductions in state medicaid budgets  increasing numbers of individuals and employers who choose not to purchase insurance  and an increased burden of co payments and deductibles to be made by patients instead of insurers 
self pay accounts pose significant collectability problems 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our net accounts receivable related to continuing operations were due from self pay patients 
further  a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients 
we have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts we deem highly collectible 
this is just one example of our continuous improvement efforts dedicated to modifying and refining our processes  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
over the longer term  several other initiatives we have previously announced should also help address this challenge 
for example  our compact with uninsured patients compact is designed to offer managed care style discounts to most uninsured patients  which enables us to offer lower rates to those patients who historically have been charged standard gross charges 
a significant portion of those charges had previously been written down in our provision for doubtful accounts 
under the compact  the discount offered to uninsured patients is recognized as a contractual allowance  which reduces net operating revenues at the time the self pay accounts are recorded 
the uninsured patient accounts  net of contractual allowances recorded  are further reduced to their net realizable value through provision for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends for self pay accounts and other factors that affect the estimation process 
the estimated costs based on selected operating expenses  which include salaries  wages and benefits  supplies and other operating expenses of caring for our self pay patients for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we also provide charity care to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive 
most patients who qualify for charity care are charged a per diem amount for services received  subject to a cap 
except for the per diem amounts  our policy is not to pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  therefore  we do not report these amounts in net operating revenues or in provision for doubtful accounts 
most states include an estimate of the cost of charity care in the determination of a hospital s eligibility for medicaid dsh payments 
the estimated costs based on the selected operating expenses described above of providing charity care for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively

only one of our individual hospitals represented more than approximately of our net operating revenues for the year ended december   and none represented more than of our total assets  excluding goodwill and intercompany receivables  at december  net operating revenues from our other operations were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively

revenues during the year ended december   net operating revenues from continuing operations increased compared to the year ended december  our same hospital net inpatient revenues for the year ended december  increased by compared to the year ended december  there were various positive and negative factors impacting our net inpatient revenues 
key positive factors include improved managed care pricing as a result of renegotiated contracts  partially offset by a reduction in stop loss payments to million in from million in  and an increase in total admissions and patient days 
key negative factors include a decrease in commercial managed care admissions  a decrease in dsh payments under various states medicaid programs to million in from million in  and favorable adjustments for prior year cost reports and related valuation allowances of million in compared to million in same hospital admissions for the year ended december  increased by compared to the year ended december  primarily due to net volume increases in many of the service lines emphasized by our targeted growth initiative  psychiatric volumes at a facility we acquired in modesto  california in november  and a net growth in physicians resulting from our general focus on recruitment efforts and our targeted physician recruitment strategies at various hospitals for specific service lines  partially offset by lower invasive cardiac procedures 
same hospital net outpatient revenues during the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december   while outpatient visits declined by for the same periods 
the primary reason for the revenue increase is improved managed care pricing 

table of contents salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  salaries  wages and benefits per adjusted patient day increased approximately in compared to the increase is primarily due to merit increases for our employees  an increase in the number of employed physicians  increased health benefits and retirement plans costs  increased annual incentive compensation costs  and hurricane related labor costs  partially offset by a decline in full time employee headcount  a decline in contract labor expenses and stock compensation expense  and improved workers compensation loss experience 
at december   approximately of the employees at our hospitals and related health care facilities in both continuing and discontinued operations were represented by labor unions 
labor relations at our facilities generally have been satisfactory 
we  and the hospital industry in general  are continuing to see an increase in the amount of union activity across the country 
as union activity increases  our salaries  wages and benefits expense may increase more rapidly than our net operating revenues 
we currently have labor contracts and collective bargaining agreements with the california nurses association cna  the service employees international union seiu  the united nurses associations of california and the american federation of state  county and municipal employees that cover registered nurses  service and maintenance workers  and other employees at of our continuing general hospitals in california  three of our continuing general hospitals in florida and one of our continuing general hospitals in philadelphia 
all of these union agreements set stable and competitive wage increases within our budgeted expectations through various dates in and early in  the cna and the seiu commenced union organizing activities at several of our hospitals pursuant to the terms of the separate peace accords we entered into with those unions in to date  we have granted the cna access to hahnemann university hospital in philadelphia and three of our hospitals in houston cypress fairbanks medical center  park plaza hospital and houston northwest medical center 
we are currently engaged in collective bargaining with the cna at cypress fairbanks medical center after registered nurses at that facility voted in favor of representation by the cna in march and the results of that election were certified by the national labor relations board nlrb in may in august  two registered nurses from cypress fairbanks medical center and park plaza hospital  with the help of the national right to work legal defense foundation  filed unfair labor practice charges against us and the cna with the nlrb 
the charges allege that our peace accord with the cna violates federal rules prohibiting employer dominated unions and improperly restricts nurses from speaking out against the union 
the filing also claims that the peace accord subverts the nlrb s role by stipulating that an arbitrator will resolve conflicts rather than federal board representatives 
in february  additional charges were filed with the nlrb relating to our hahnemann university hospital in philadelphia 
the nlrb is considering all of the claims  and we expect a formal decision shortly  however  we presently cannot determine the ultimate resolution of this matter 
separately  we are defending our actions in connection with the seiu s failed attempt to organize employees at our saint francis hospital in memphis  tennessee 
a trial in that matter was expected to commence in january  but has since been postponed while the parties engage in settlement discussions 
in addition  in january  we executed an agreement with the seiu postponing for one year any further organizing efforts by that union as contemplated by the terms of our peace accord 
included in salaries  wages and benefits expense in the year ended december  is million of stock based compensation expense compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to the vesting of higher grant date fair value awards from prior years and the issuance of new awards at lower grant date fair values primarily due to our lower stock price 
supplies supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues increased by for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   while supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased approximately in compared to this increase in supplies expense per adjusted patient day reflects higher costs for orthopedics  pharmaceuticals and implants due to increased volumes  inflation and technology improvements  and higher surgical supply costs due to an increase in surgeries  partially offset by lower cardiovascular supply costs  which resulted from a decrease in cardiovascular procedures 
we strive to control supplies expense through product standardization  bulk purchases  contract compliance  improved utilization and operational improvements that should minimize waste 
the items of current cost reduction focus continue to be cardiac stents and pacemakers  orthopedics and implants  and high cost pharmaceuticals 
we also utilize the group purchasing strategies and supplies management services of broadlane a company in which we held a interest until august  which offers group purchasing procurement strategy  outsourcing and e commerce services to the health care industry 

table of contents provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net operating revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the negative impact on bad debts as a result of the growth in self pay accounts assigned to our collection agencies  a slight decline in self pay collection trends since the first half of  pricing increases and improved charge capture in our emergency departments were only partially mitigated by improved point of service collections and improved insurance balances by aging category 
the table below shows the net accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payer at december  and december  december  december  accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts net in millions medicare medicaid net cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances commercial managed care governmental managed care self pay uninsured self pay balance after estimated future recoveries from accounts assigned to collection agencies other total continuing operations total discontinued operations a significant portion of our provision for doubtful accounts relates to self pay patients 
collection of accounts receivable has been a key area of focus  particularly over the past several years  as we have experienced adverse changes in our business mix 
at december   our collection rate on self pay accounts was approximately  including collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors 
during  we experienced a downward trend in our self pay collection rate as follows at march   at june   and at september  these self pay collection rates include payments made by patients  including co payments and deductibles paid by patients with insurance  prior to an account being classified and assigned to our in house self pay collection group 
the comparable self pay collection percentage as of december   adjusted for the reclassification of certain hospitals to discontinued operations  was approximately 
our provision for doubtful accounts in the three months ended december  includes a million unfavorable adjustment in the estimate of necessary bad debt reserve levels at year end compared to a favorable adjustment of million in the three months ended december  the change in anticipated collections as of december  was based on a look back period of months of collections 
we have performed systematic analyses to focus our attention on drivers of bad debt for each hospital 
while emergency department use is the primary contributor to our provision for doubtful accounts in the aggregate  this is not the case at all hospitals 
as a result  we are increasing our focus on targeted initiatives that concentrate on non emergency department patients 
these initiatives are intended to promote process efficiencies in working self pay accounts we deem highly collectible 
this is just one example of our continuous improvement efforts dedicated to modifying and refining our processes  enhancing our technology and improving staff training throughout the revenue cycle in an effort to increase collections and reduce accounts receivable 
payment pressure from managed care payers also affects our provision for doubtful accounts 
we typically experience ongoing managed care payment delays and disputes  however  we continue to work with these payers to obtain adequate and timely reimbursement for our services 
our estimated collection rate on managed care accounts was approximately as of both december  and december   adjusted for hospitals reclassified to discontinued operations  which includes collections from point of service through collections by our in house collection agency or external collection vendors 

table of contents we continue to focus on revenue cycle initiatives to improve cash flow 
one specific initiative that was started during the three months ended september  and is expected to be completed in is the center for patient access services  which is a centralized dedicated operation that performs financial clearance  including completing insurance eligibility checks  documenting verification of benefits  providing required notifications to managed care payers  obtaining pre authorizations when necessary and contacting the patient to offer pre service financial counseling 
although we continue to improve our methodology for evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we may incur future charges if there are unfavorable changes in the trends affecting the net realizable value of our accounts receivable 
we manage our provision for doubtful accounts using hospital specific goals and benchmarks such as total cash collections  point of service cash collections  accounts receivable days outstanding ar days  and accounts receivable aging 
the following tables present the approximate aging by payer of our continuing operations net accounts receivable of billion and billion  excluding cost report settlements payable and valuation allowances of million and million  at december  and december   respectively december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total december  medicare medicaid managed care indemnity  self pay and other total days days days over days total our ar days from continuing operations were days at december  compared to days at december  ar days at december  and are within our target of less than days 
ar days are calculated as our accounts receivable from continuing operations on the last date in the quarter divided by our revenue from continuing operations for the quarter ended on that date divided by the number of days in the quarter 
as of december   we had a cumulative total of patient account assignments dating back at least three years or older of approximately billion related to our continuing operations being pursued by our in house and outside collection agencies or vendors 
these accounts have already been written off and are not included in our receivables or in the allowance for doubtful accounts  however  an estimate of future recoveries from all the accounts at collection agencies is determined based on our historical experience and recorded in accounts receivable 
patient advocates from our medical eligibility program mep screen patients in the hospital to determine whether those patients meet eligibility requirements for financial assistance programs 
they also expedite the process of applying for these government programs 
receivables from patients who are potentially eligible for medicaid are classified as medicaid pending  under our mep  with appropriate contractual allowances recorded 
based on recent trends  approximately of all accounts in our mep are ultimately approved for benefits under a government program such as medicaid

other operating expenses other operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased by for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  other operating expenses per adjusted patient day increased by approximately in compared to primarily due to higher physician fees  contracted services  repair and maintenance costs  utility costs and an million gain on a sale of a medical office building in florida in  which reduced other operating expenses  partially offset by lower information systems implementation costs  consulting costs and malpractice expense 
malpractice expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in malpractice expense is primarily attributable to improved claims experience  partially offset by million of incremental expense related to the lower interest rate environment  which increased the discounted present value of projected future liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and restructuring charges during the year ended december   we recorded net impairment and restructuring charges of million compared to million  net of insurance recoveries of million  for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail of these charges and related liabilities

if these expectations are not met  or if in the future negative trends occur that impact our future outlook  further impairments of long lived assets and goodwill may occur  and we will incur additional restructuring charges 
future restructuring of our regions that changes our goodwill reporting units could also result in further impairments of our goodwill 
litigation and investigation costs litigation and investigation costs in continuing operations for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the amount includes a million increase in the estimated liabilities for wage and hour actions and other unrelated employment matters further described in note to the consolidated financial statements

includes minimum revenue guarantees  primarily related to physicians under relocation agreements and physician groups that provide services at our hospitals  and operating lease guarantees 
these agreements contain various rights and termination provisions 
the standby letters of credit are required principally by our insurers and various states to collateralize our workers compensation programs pursuant to statutory requirements and as security to collateralize the deductible and self insured retentions under certain of our professional and general liability insurance programs 
the amount of collateral required is principally dependent upon the level of claims activity and our creditworthiness 
the insurers require the collateral in case we are unable to meet our obligations to claimants within the deductible or self insured retention layers 
the standby letters of credit are issued under our revolving credit facility 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to the expansion and renovation of existing facilities  including amounts to comply with applicable laws and regulations  equipment and information systems additions and replacements  introduction of new medical technologies  design and construction of new hospitals and buildings  and various other capital improvements 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for the year ending december  will total approximately million to million  including million that was accrued at december   but not paid until the anticipated capital expenditures include approximately million in to meet california seismic requirements for 
table of contents our remaining california facilities after all planned divestitures 
we currently estimate spending a total of approximately million to comply with the requirements under california s seismic regulations 
our current estimated seismic costs are considerably lower than certain previous estimates because several of our hospitals have been evaluated as having reduced risk using a new evaluation tool 
our total estimated seismic expenditure amount has not been adjusted for inflation 
our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending december  also include approximately million to improve disability access at certain of our facilities  as a result of a consent decree in a class action lawsuit 
we expect to spend a total of approximately million on such improvements over the next seven years 
we were previously required to complete the same work over the next three years  but negotiated an extension to allow for a more orderly use of cash flow 
interest payments  net of capitalized interest  were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest payments since is primarily due to payments related to our civil settlement with the federal government  as such payments did not begin until the fourth quarter of we anticipate that our gross interest payments  including capitalized interest  for the year ending december  will be approximately million 
however  this amount could increase depending on the success of our recent offer to exchange up to billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes maturing in december and june for an equal aggregate principal amount of two new series of senior secured notes maturing in and in a private placement 
although the total amount of our long term debt will not change as a result of the exchange offer  the interest rates on the new notes actually issued in connection with the exchange offer will be higher than the interest rates on our existing and notes  resulting in increased interest payments for us

our primary source of operating cash is the collection of accounts receivable 
as we experience changes in our business mix and as admissions of uninsured and underinsured patients grow  our operating cash flow is negatively impacted due to lower levels of cash collections and higher levels of bad debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  key negative and positive factors contributing to the change between the and periods include the following net income tax payments of million in the year ended december  compared to refunds of million received in  payments of million million in principal and million in interest in the year ended december  related to our civil settlement with the federal government compared to million million in principal and million in interest in  as these payments did not begin until the fourth quarter of  additional aggregate annual k matching contributions and annual incentive compensation payments of million million in year ended december  compared to million in  additional cash flows as a result of enhanced management of accounts payable million and accounts receivable million  insurance recoveries of million in the year ended december  related to litigation  which was settled in december  involving our former redding medical center  lower investment earnings in compared to of approximately million  excluding million of redding insurance recoveries part of the million of redding recoveries discussed above classified as investment earnings  a million decline in the cash and cash equivalents balance related to our medicare hmo insurance subsidiary operating in louisiana primarily due to the timing of monthly payments from cms  and

in  we received proceeds of million from our investment in metrocrest hospital authority bonds essentially  the source of these proceeds was our final payment of million under our lease agreement with the authority to operate two hospitals in the dallas  texas area and million from the cash surrender value or basis reduction of certain life insurance policies 
in addition  in we received million of insurance recoveries for hurricane related property damage 
further initiatives to increase the efficiency of our balance sheet during could generate incremental cash 
these initiatives include the sale of our medical office buildings and excess land  buildings or other underutilized or inefficient assets 
we are currently working to reach definitive agreements in connection with our previously announced intention to sell up to of our owned medical office buildings 
these types of transactions are subject to significant negotiation and due diligence efforts and likely will be delayed as a result of the effects of the current credit environment 
the remaining owned medical office buildings are less likely to be sold as we are either a substantial or the primary occupant  or because the buildings are strategically located for our purposes 
the realization of any incremental cash as a result of balance sheet initiatives cannot be assured 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  including million and million  respectively  for construction of a new hospital in el paso  texas  which was completed in may  and a replacement hospital in mt 
pleasant  south carolina  which we expect to complete in we use the fair market value to record our investments that are held for sale 
as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements  the majority of our investments are valued based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
however  at december   one of our captive insurance subsidiaries held million principal value of auction rate securities  classified as investments  whose auctions have failed due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
due to the illiquidity of these securities for over a year  we recorded an other than temporary impairment of approximately million in the year ended december  in addition  we recorded a loss of approximately million related to million of investments in the reserve yield plus fund and reclassified the balance from cash equivalents as the fund has experienced liquidity issues and temporarily suspended distributions 
the fund is currently in the process of liquidating its investments and distributing cash to its investors and  in the three months ended december   we received million of cash distributions from the fund 
we expect the fund to liquidate all of its investments  however  the ultimate timing is uncertain 
we will continue to closely monitor our investments  but do not anticipate any future decrease in value of either the auction rate securities or the reserve yield plus fund to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have no other investments that we expect will be negatively affected by the current economic crisis that will materially impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants we have a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility that is collateralized by patient accounts receivable of our acute care and specialty hospitals  and bears interest at our option based on the london interbank offered rate plus basis points or citigroup s base rate  as defined in the credit agreement  plus basis points 
the revolving credit agreement includes a provision  which we believe is customary in receivables backed credit facilities  that gives our banks the right to require that proceeds of collections of substantially all of our consolidated accounts receivable be applied directly to repay outstanding loans and other amounts that are due and payable under the revolving credit facility at any time that unused borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is less than million or if an event of default has occurred and is continuing thereunder 
in that event  we would seek to re borrow under the revolving credit facility to satisfy our operating cash requirements 
our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to conditions that we believe are customary in such facilities  including that no events of default then exist 

table of contents in june  we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement that allows us to grant liens on certain hospital facilities and inventory up to certain dollar limits set forth in the amendment 
the amendment also provides us with additional flexibility over the remaining term of the credit agreement to pursue  at our option  various alternatives to refinance our existing unsecured senior debt  if market conditions and other considerations warrant 
the alternatives include the issuance of secured debt  preferred stock and convertible debt  as well as other unsecured debt 
the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants and conditions that have  among other requirements  limitations on liens on principal properties and sale and lease back transactions with respect to principal properties 
a principal property is defined in the indentures as a hospital that has an asset value on our books in excess of of our consolidated net tangible assets  as defined 
the above limitations do not apply  however  to debt that is secured by assets other than principal properties or debt that is secured by principal properties if the aggregate of such secured debt does not exceed of our consolidated net tangible assets  as further described in the indentures 
the indentures also prohibit the consolidation  merger or sale of all or substantially all assets unless no event of default would result after giving effect to such transaction 
all of our senior notes are general unsecured senior debt obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness  but are effectively subordinated to the obligations of our subsidiaries and any obligations under our revolving credit facility to the extent of the collateral 
in early  we made an offer to exchange up to billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes maturing in december and june for an equal aggregate principal amount of two new series of senior secured notes maturing in and in a private placement 
as of the filing date of this report  the offer remained open 
any new notes ultimately issued as part of the exchange offer will be guaranteed by and secured by a pledge of the capital stock and other ownership interests of certain of our subsidiaries 
although the total amount of our long term debt will not change as a result of the exchange offer  the interest rates on the new notes actually issued in connection with the exchange offer will be higher than the interest rates on our existing and notes  resulting in increased interest expense for us 
we may also be required to record a significant net gain in connection with the exchange offer  primarily based on the anticipated fair value of the new notes 
from time to time  we expect to engage in additional capital markets  bank credit and other financing activities depending on our needs and financing alternatives available at that time 
we believe our existing indentures provide significant flexibility for future collateralized borrowings 
although we are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions in our revolving credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes  our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was limited to million at december   based on our eligible receivables and limitations related to our fixed charge coverage ratio under the agreement 
at december   there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
we also had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
we generally indemnify our current and former officers and directors from claims and lawsuits related to their actions taken on our behalf during their employment 
liquidity we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents on hand  our investments in the reserve yield plus fund  marketable securities of our captive insurance companies classified as noncurrent investments on our balance sheet  availability under our revolving credit facility  future cash provided by operating activities and anticipated proceeds from the sales of hospitals and other assets held for sale should be adequate to meet our current cash needs 
these sources of liquidity should also be adequate to finance planned capital expenditures  payments on the current portion of our long term debt and other presently known operating needs 
long term liquidity for debt service will be dependent on improved cash provided by operating activities  results of balance sheet initiatives previously discussed and  given favorable market conditions  future borrowings or refinancings 
however  our cash requirements could be materially affected by the deterioration in our results of operations  as well as the various uncertainties discussed in this and other sections  which could require us to pursue any number of financing options  including  but not limited to  additional borrowings  debt refinancing  asset sales or other financing alternatives 
with the current tightening in the credit markets  the level  if any  of these financing sources cannot be assured  and the ability of our counterparties to close asset sales as previously anticipated could also be affected 

table of contents we are aggressively identifying and implementing further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance  including cash flow 
among the areas being addressed are volume growth  managed care payer contracting  procurement efficiencies  cost standardization  bad debt expense reduction initiatives  underperforming hospitals  and certain hospital and overhead costs not related to patient care 
although these initiatives may result in improved performance  that performance may remain somewhat below our hospital management peers because of geographic and other differences in hospital portfolios 
off balance sheet arrangements excluding the hospitals whose operating results are included in discontinued operations  our consolidated operating results for the years ended december   and include billion  million and million  respectively  of net operating revenues and million  million and million  respectively  of income from operations generated from five general hospitals operated by us under lease arrangements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the respective buildings and the future lease obligations under four of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as they are considered operating leases 
the current terms of these leases expire between and  not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise 
if these leases expire  we would no longer generate revenue or expenses from these hospitals 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  except for million of standby letters of credit outstanding and guarantees as of december  recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we must use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use 
in general  we base the estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  given the particular circumstances in which we operate 
actual results may vary from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  and may produce materially different outcomes under different conditions or when using different assumptions 
our critical accounting estimates cover the following areas recognition of net operating revenues  including contractual allowances  provisions for doubtful accounts  accruals for general and professional liability risks  accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans  accruals for litigation losses  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  asset retirement obligations  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize net operating revenues in the period in which services are performed 
net operating revenues primarily consist of net patient service revenues that are recorded based on established billing rates ie  gross charges  less estimated discounts for contractual and other allowances  principally for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and managed care and other health plans  as well as uninsured patients under the compact 
revenues under the traditional fee for service medicare and medicaid programs are based primarily on prospective payment systems 
discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in earlier periods  and certain other payments  such as dsh  gme  ime and bad debt expense  which are based on our hospitals cost reports  are estimated using historical trends and current factors 
cost report settlements under these programs are subject to audit by medicare and medicaid auditors and administrative and judicial review  and it can take several years until final settlement of such matters is determined and completely resolved 
because the laws  regulations  instructions and rule interpretations governing medicare and medicaid reimbursement are complex and change frequently  the estimates recorded by us could change by material amounts 
we have a system and estimation process for recording medicare net patient revenue and estimated cost report settlements 
this results in us recording accruals to reflect the expected final settlements on our cost reports 
for filed cost reports  we record the accrual based on those cost reports and subsequent activity  and record a valuation allowance against those cost reports based on historical settlement trends 
the accrual for periods for which a cost report is yet to be filed is recorded based on estimates of what we expect to report on the filed cost reports  and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as previously described 
cost reports must generally be filed within five months after the end of the annual cost report reporting period 
after the cost report is filed  the accrual and corresponding valuation allowance may need to be adjusted 
revenues under managed care plans are based primarily on payment terms involving predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates  discounted fee for service rates and or other similar contractual arrangements 
these revenues are also subject to review and possible audit by the payers 
the payers are billed for patient services on an individual patient basis 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review and adjudication of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances at the individual hospital level utilizing billing data on an individual patient basis 
at the end of each month  on an individual hospital basis  we estimate our expected reimbursement for patients of managed care plans based on the applicable contract terms 
these estimates are periodically reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known contract terms as well as payment history 
although we do not separately accumulate and disclose the aggregate amount of adjustments to the estimated reimbursement for every patient bill  we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
we do not believe there were any adjustments to estimates of individual patient bills that were material to our revenues 
in addition  on a corporate wide basis  we do not record any general provision for adjustments to estimated contractual allowances for managed care plans 
revenues related to self pay patients may qualify for a discount under the compact  whereby the gross charges based on established billing rates would be reduced by an estimated discount for contractual allowance 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned under all the above arrangements 
we know of no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with any payers that would affect our revenues for which we have not adequately provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
provisions for doubtful accounts although outcomes vary  our policy is to attempt to collect amounts due from patients  including co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  at the time of service while complying with all federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
generally  as required by emtala  patients may not be denied emergency treatment due to inability to pay 
therefore  services  including the legally required medical screening examination and stabilization of the patient  are performed without delaying to obtain insurance information 
in non emergency circumstances or for elective procedures and services  it is our policy to verify insurance prior to a patient being treated 
we provide for an allowance against accounts receivable that could become uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable by hospital  our historical collection experience by hospital and for each type of payer over an month look back period  and other relevant factors 

table of contents our practice is to reduce the net carrying value of self pay accounts receivable  including accounts related to the co payments and deductibles due from patients with insurance  to their estimated net realizable value at the time of billing 
generally  uncollected balances are assigned to our in house collection agency between to days  once patient responsibility has been identified 
when accounts are assigned to the collection agency by the hospital  the accounts are completely written off the hospital s books through the provision for doubtful accounts  and an estimated future recovery amount is calculated and recorded as a receivable on the hospital s books at the same time 
the estimated future recovery amount is adjusted based on the aging of the accounts and changes to actual recovery rates 
the estimated future recovery amount for self pay accounts is gradually written down whereby it is fully reserved if the amount is not paid within two years after the account is assigned to our in house collection agency 
managed care accounts are collected through our hospital based business offices or regional business offices  whereby the account balances remain in the hospital s patient accounting system and on the hospital s books  and are adjusted based on an analysis of the net realizable value as they age 
managed care accounts collected through our hospital based business offices or regional business offices are gradually written down whereby they are fully reserved if the accounts are not paid within two years 
changes in the collectability of aged managed care accounts receivable are ongoing and impact our provision for doubtful accounts 
we continue to experience payment pressure from managed care companies concerning amounts of past billings 
we aggressively pursue collection of these accounts receivable using all means at our disposal  including arbitration and litigation  but we may not be successful 
accruals for general and professional liability risks we accrue for estimated professional and general liability claims  to the extent not covered by insurance  when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we maintain reserves  which are based on actuarial estimates for the portion of our professional liability risks  including incurred but not reported claims to the extent we do not have insurance coverage 
our liability consists of estimates established based upon discounted actuarial calculations using several factors  including the number of asserted claims and reported incidents  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimates of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  the timing of historical payments  and risk free discount rates used to determine the present value of projected payments 
the liability is adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known 
malpractice expense is recorded within other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will change significantly if future claims differ from historical trends 
in addition  because of the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates 
accruals for supplemental executive retirement plans our supplemental executive retirement plan benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
the discount rate is a critical assumption in determining the elements of expense and liability measurement 
we evaluate this critical assumption annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover  and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we decreased our discount rate to in from in to reflect market interest rate conditions at our december  measurement date 
the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for by million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would increase net periodic pension expense for by million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at december  by million 

table of contents accruals for litigation losses we record reserves for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
under sfas  a loss contingency is recorded if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we record probable loss contingencies based on the best estimate of the loss 
if a range of loss can be reasonably estimated  but no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
these estimates are often initially developed earlier than when the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are adjusted if additional information becomes known 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we calculate the amount of an impairment if the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of the assets is estimated based on appraisals  established market values of comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections we believe to be reasonable and supportable 
they require our subjective judgments and take into account assumptions about revenue and expense growth rates 
these assumptions may vary by type of facility and presume stable or improving results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell 
in such circumstances  our estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparable assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows 
these fair value estimates can change by material amounts in subsequent periods 
many factors and assumptions can impact the estimates  including the future financial results of our hospitals  how the hospitals are operated in the future  changes in health care industry trends and regulations  and the nature of the ultimate disposition of the assets 
in certain cases  these fair value estimates assume the highest and best use of the assets in the future to a market place participant is other than as a hospital 
in these cases  the estimates are based on the fair value of the real property and equipment if utilized other than as a hospital 
the impairment recognized does not include the costs of closing the hospital or other future operating costs  which could be substantial 
accordingly  the ultimate net cash realized from the hospital  should we choose to sell it  could be significantly less than its impaired value 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are subject to impairment tests performed at least annually 
for goodwill  we perform the test at the reporting unit level  as defined by appropriate accounting standards  when events occur that require an evaluation to be performed or at least annually 
if we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value  then we reduce the carrying value  including any allocated goodwill  to fair value 
estimates of fair value are based on appraisals  established market prices for comparative assets or internal estimates of future net cash flows and presume stable or improving results at our hospitals  depending on their circumstances 
if the presumed level of performance does not occur as expected  impairment may result 

table of contents asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with asset retirements in the period in which it is incurred  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation can be made 
when the liability is initially recorded  we capitalize the cost of the asset retirement obligation by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost associated with the retirement obligation is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the obligation  any difference between the cost to settle the asset retirement obligation and the liability recorded is recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
the calculation of the asset retirement obligation is a critical accounting estimate because factors used in calculating the obligation can change  which could result in larger or smaller estimated obligations that could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the significant assumptions and estimates used in the calculation include the following estimated settlement date of the obligation the year when the asset is no longer deemed to have any future useful life  and the facility or asset is closed  or otherwise disposed of  is when final settlement of the obligation is estimated to occur  and is generally based on the remaining years of useful life of our facilities or the expiration of a lease 
changes in demand  competing facilities  economic conditions  technology advancements  state regulations and availability of physicians  nurses and staff can affect the estimated settlement date 
retirement obligation costs these costs are estimated based on our knowledge of the applicable laws and regulations  known facts and circumstances of specific obligations  and cost estimates obtained from our knowledge and past experience 
asbestos presence the estimated amount of asbestos in our facilities was determined by our construction staff based on their knowledge of the architectural state of the facility  the age of the facility and whether any renovation had recently occurred 
due to facilities changing ownership several times and our experience during renovations of inconsistent use of building materials  it cannot be known with certainty the exact amount of asbestos present or the exact location of all asbestos that may need to be remediated 
inflation rate the inflation rate applied to current remediation costs is used to estimate the future value of the remediation costs at the time the retirement obligation is estimated to be settled 
we have assumed an inflation rate of based on the nature of the retirement obligations 
discount rate the estimated costs at the anticipated settlement date are discounted back to the year the asset was built or acquired to determine the amount of the obligation when it was incurred 
the estimate of the initial obligation has been accreted to the current date in accordance with sfas the discount rate represents our credit adjusted  risk free rate of interest  at the time the obligation was originally recorded  which was estimated to be 
using these estimates and assumptions  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  fixed asset cost  accumulated depreciation and the asset retirement obligation were calculated for each of our facilities that have known asset retirement obligations 
subsequent changes to these assumptions will affect future depreciation and accretion expense 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb staff position no

this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 

table of contents developing our provision for income taxes and analysis of uncertain tax positions items requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels  the availability  or lack thereof  of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits  the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
we consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions  and such judgments are subject to periodic review 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are derecognized in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
while we believe we have adequately provided for our income tax receivables or liabilities and our deferred tax assets or liabilities in accordance with sfas and fin  adverse determinations by taxing authorities or changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for the cost of stock based compensation using the fair value method required by sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  under which the cost of stock option grants and other incentive awards to employees  directors  advisors and consultants generally is measured by the fair value of the awards on their grant date and is recognized over the vesting periods of the awards  whether or not the awards had any intrinsic value during the period 
under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of stock option grants as of the date of each grant  using a binomial lattice model 
the key assumptions of the binomial lattice model include expected volatility  expected dividend yield  expected life  expected forfeiture rate  risk free interest rate range  early exercise threshold  and early exercise rate 
the expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model incorporates historical and implied share price volatility and is based on an analysis of historical prices of our stock and open market exchanged options 
the expected volatility reflects the historical volatility for a duration consistent with the contractual life of the options  and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open market exchanges 
the historical share price volatility excludes the movements in our stock price during the period october  through december  due to unique events occurring during that time  which caused the extreme volatility of our stock price 
the expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding 
this model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price 
the risk free interest rates are based on zero coupon united states treasury yields in effect at the date of grant consistent with the expected exercise timeframes 

table of contents the most critical of the above assumptions in our calculations of fair value is the expected life of an option  because it  in turn  is a principal part of our calculations of expected volatility and interest rates 
accordingly  we reevaluate our estimate of expected life at each major grant date 
our reevaluation is based on recent exercise patterns 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below presents information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments as of december  the fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments 
at december   we had no borrowings subject to or with variable interest rates 
maturity date  year ending december  thereafter total fair value dollars in millions fixed rate long term debt average interest rates we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 
at december   we had long term  market sensitive investments held by our captive insurance subsidiaries 
our market risk associated with our investments in debt securities classified as non current assets is substantially mitigated by the long term nature and type of the investments in the portfolio 
at december   the net accumulated unrealized losses related to our captive insurance companies investment portfolios were approximately million 
we have no affiliation with partnerships  trusts or other entities sometimes referred to as special purpose or variable interest entities whose purpose is to facilitate off balance sheet financial transactions or similar arrangements by us 
thus  we have no exposure to the financing  liquidity  market or credit risks associated with such entities
