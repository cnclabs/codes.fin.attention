management strategy the company s goal is to serve as a community oriented financial institution serving the northwestern new jersey  northeastern pennsylvania and orange county  new york marketplace 
while offering traditional community bank loan and deposit products and services  the company obtains significant non interest income through its tri state insurance agency  inc tri state  insurance brokerage operations and the sale of non deposit products 
we report the operations of tri state as a separate segment from our commercial banking operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for december  included herein for more financial data regarding our two segments 
forward looking statements when used in this discussion the words believes  anticipates  contemplated  expects or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to those forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after this date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for december  included herein 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effect cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results may differ from those estimates 
management makes adjustments to its assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate 
the amounts currently estimated by us are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following critical accounting policies encompass the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense reflects the amount deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio 
management s judgment is based on the evaluation of the past experience of individual loans  the assessment of current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
loan losses are charged directly against the allowance for loan losses and recoveries on previously charged off loans are added to the allowance 
management uses significant estimates to determine the allowance for loan losses 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including current economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows  and other relevant factors 
since the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses is dependent to a great extent on conditions that may be beyond our control  it is possible that management s estimates of the allowance for loan losses and actual results could differ in the near term 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
for example  a downturn in the local economy could cause increases in non performing loans 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could cause some of our loans to become inadequately collateralized 
in either case  this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively 
index impact earnings 
additionally  a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively impact earnings 
finally  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examination  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
they may require additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
future increases to our allowance for loan losses  whether due to unexpected changes in economic conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our future results of operations 
stock based compensation 
the company currently has several stock option plans in place for employees and directors of the company 
the company accounts for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january  based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on a grant date fair value estimate in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
r 
the company had  unvested stock options at december   therefore  the adoption of fasb statement no 
r relates to these unvested stock options and any stock options granted after january  income taxes 
management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation and evaluation of the timing and recognition of resulting tax assets and liabilities 
management uses the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
deferred tax expense is the result of changes between deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are allowance for loan losses  deferred compensation and securities available to sale 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has recorded goodwill of million at december  related to the acquisition of tri state insurance agency on october  and thousand from the acquisition of the port jervis  new york branch office on march  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
requires that goodwill is not amortized to expense  but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company periodically assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill require additional impairment testing 
the company performs its annual impairment test on the goodwill of tri state in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value  no write downs of goodwill are necessary 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an additional test is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of goodwill 
the company determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during and business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance could result in different assessments of the fair value and could result in impairment charges in the future 
investment securities impairment evaluation 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investments in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value

the write downs are due to the decline in fair value of these foreclosed properties  and the additional expense is related to the ongoing cost to maintain those foreclosed properties held by the bank 
during  our expense for fdic deposit insurance premiums increased by thousand  due to the availability of a thousand credit in and higher assessments rates applicable to all insured institutions in our expense for fdic deposit insurance will increase substantially due both to an increase in assessments rates adopted by the fdic effective april  and a likely special assessment

the bank s regulators have implemented risk based guidelines which require banks to maintain certain minimum capital as a percent of such assets and certain off balance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors risk adjusted assets 
banks are required to maintain tier i capital as a percent of risk adjusted assets of and tier ii capital as of risk adjusted assets of at a minimum 
at december   the bank s tier i and tier ii capital ratios were and  respectively 
the company also maintained million in cash and cash equivalents which could be contributed to the bank as capital 
in addition to the risk based guidelines discussed above  the bank s regulators require that banks which meet the regulators highest performance and operational standards to maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier i capital as a percent of tangible assets of 
for those banks with higher levels of risk or that are experiencing or anticipating growth  the minimum will be proportionately increased 
minimum leverage ratios for each bank and bank holding company are established and updated through the ongoing regulatory examination process 
as of december   the bank had a leverage ratio of 

index off balance sheet arrangements 
the company s financial statements do not reflect off balance sheet arrangements that are made in the normal course of business 
these off balance sheet arrangements consist of unfunded loans and letters of credit made under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
these unused commitments  at december  totaled million 
this consisted of million in commitments to grant commercial and residential loans  million in commercial construction lines of credit  million in home equity lines of credit  and the remainder in other unused commitments 
these instruments have fixed maturity dates  and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon  they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to the company 
management believes that any amounts actually drawn upon can be funded in the normal course of operations 
interest rate risk an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is the volatility of a company s earnings from a movement in market interest rates 
interest rate gap analysis is a common  though imperfect  measure of interest rate risk 
we do not employ gap analysis as a rate risk management tool  but rather we rely upon earnings at risk analysis to forecast the impact on our net interest income instantaneous and basis point increases in market rates 
in assessing the impact on earnings  the rate shock analysis assumes that no change occurs in our funding sources or types of assets in response to the rate change 
our board of directors has established limits for interest rate risk based on the percentage change in interest income we would incur in differing interest rate scenarios 
at december  the percentage of change in interest income in the event of a or basis point change in interest rates was within the policy limits 
our financial modeling simulates our cash flows  interest income and interest expense from earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for a twelve month period in each of the different interest rate environments  using actual individual deposit  loan and investment maturities and rates in the model calculations 
assumptions regarding the likelihood of prepayments on residential mortgage loans and investments are made based on historical relationships between interest rates and prepayments 
commercial loans with prepayment penalties are assumed to pay on schedule to maturity 
in actual practice  commercial borrowers may request and be granted interest rate reductions during the life of a commercial loan due to competition from financial institutions and declining interest rates 
the following table sets forth our interest rate risk profile at december  and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the impact on net interest income illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions 
change in percent gap as a change in percent gap as a net interest change in net of net interest change in net of dollars in thousands income interest income total assets income interest income total assets down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points impact of inflation and changing prices unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  the level of interest rates has a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or change with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  which are affected by inflation 
accordingly  the liquidity  interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities are more indicative of its ability to maintain acceptable performance levels 
management of the company monitors and seeks to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes by attempting to match the maturities of assets and liabilities to gap  thus seeking to minimize the potential effect of inflation
