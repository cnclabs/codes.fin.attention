net income was positively impacted by increased product sales volumes due to increased demand for certain navistar product lines as well as production efficiencies and reduced fixed expenses 
in connection with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in mexico  the company expensed approximately  of transition costs through december  looking forward  the company anticipates decreased sales levels during as a result of the uncertainties in the current economy 
industry analysts are forecasting an overall decrease in heavy duty truck production of approximately compared to levels 
in response to the expected decreased sales levels  the company is focused on reducing costs and adjusting operations 
management believes these actions will lessen the impact of the significantly reduced sales  although profitability will continue to be impacted in due to the large fixed cost component of the company s business and due to the difficulty in maintaining production efficiencies in a decreased and volatile sales climate 
additionally  the company expects to incur approximately  of transition and start up expenses in associated with its new manufacturing facility in matamoros  mexico which will further decrease earnings 
results of operations compared with net sales for totaled  an approximate decrease from the  reported for included in total sales are tooling project revenues of  for and  for tooling project sales result from billings to customers for molds and assembly equipment built specifically for their products

table of contents credit that was used to finance the remaining portion of the stock repurchase from navistar 
partially offsetting higher interest expense from the share repurchase was a reduction in interest associated with reductions of long term debt due to regularly scheduled payments 
variable interest rates experienced by core molding technologies with respect to its two long term borrowing facilities have increased  however  due to the interest rate swaps previously entered into by core molding technologies  the interest rate is essentially fixed for these two debt instruments 
income tax expense for was approximately of total income before taxes compared to approximately in in  the company adjusted the state and local tax rates due to changes in the tax laws of various states

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds have been cash generated from operating activities and bank borrowings 
the company s primary cash requirements are for operating expenses and capital expenditures 
in december of  the company and its subsidiary  corecomposites  entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with keybank national association keybank as a lender  lead arranger  sole book runner and administrative agent 
under the credit agreement  keybank has made certain loans  which include i a  construction loan  ii an  construction loan  iii an  revolving credit commitment  iv a  term loan to refinance a previous term loan with keybank  and v a letter of credit in an undrawn face amount of  with respect to the company s existing industrial development revenue bond financing 
as widely reported  financial markets in the united states  europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions that include severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values 
while currently these conditions have not impaired the company s ability to access credit markets and finance operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies  which may impact the company s ability to borrow in the future 
cash provided by operating activities totaled  net income contributed  to operating cash flow 
non cash deductions of depreciation and amortization contributed  to operating cash flow 
in addition  the increase in the postretirement healthcare benefits liability of  is not a current cash obligation  and this item will not be a significant cash obligation until more retirees begin to utilize their retirement medical benefits 
changes in working capital decreased cash provided by operating activities by  the decrease in working capital was impacted by increase in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in accounts payable 
these uses of cash were partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities 
cash used for investing activities was  for the year ended december   which primarily represented payments related to the company s construction of a new manufacturing facility in mexico 
the company previously announced plans to spend approximately million on a new facility that will replace its existing leased facility in mexico and add compression molding capabilities 
to finance this project  the company has received bank financing for new borrowings of  of which the company has drawn  at december  at december   commitments for capital expenditures in progress were  capital expenditures for are anticipated to be  which include  related to the construction of the company s new manufacturing facility in mexico 
financing activities increased cash flow by  the primary financing activity is from borrowings on the construction loan for the new facility in mexico of  partially offsetting these borrowings were principal repayments on the company s secured note payable of  and the company s industrial revenue bond of  additionally  net repayments of  on the line of credit decreased financing cash flow 

table of contents at december   the company had no cash on hand and an available line of credit of  line of credit  which is scheduled to mature on april  at december   core molding technologies had outstanding borrowings on the line of credit of  management expects this line of credit to be adequate to meet core molding technologies liquidity needs 
the company is required to meet certain financial covenants included in its debt agreements with respect to leverage ratios  fixed charge ratios  capital expenditures as well as other customary affirmative and negative covenants 
as of december   the company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants for the line of credit  the secured note payable  the two construction loans related to the new facility in mexico  the letter of credit securing the industrial revenue bond and certain equipment leases 
on march   the company entered into a first amendment to the credit agreement with keybank the first amendment 
pursuant to the terms of the first amendment  the lender agreed to modify certain terms of the credit agreement 
these modifications included modification of the definition of ebitda to add back transition costs up to  associated with the transition and startup of the new production facility in matamoros and add back non cash compensation expense recorded under sfas r modification of the fixed charge definition to exclude from consolidated interest expense any measure of ineffectiveness from interest rate swaps and amortization of loan origination and issuance costs modification of the leverage ratio from x to x at june   x at september   and x at december  increase the applicable margin for interest rates applicable to libor loans effective march  to basis points for both construction loans and the revolving line of credit  all rates decrease basis points upon reaching a leverage ratio of less than to increase the letter of credit fee on the industrial revenue bond to basis points increase the libor floor on the  construction loan and revolving line of credit to and implement a libor floor on the  construction loan 
based on the company s forecasts which are primarily based on industry analysts estimates of heavy and medium duty truck production volumes as well as other assumptions management believes to be reasonable  management believes that the company will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants as amended under the first amendment to the credit agreement for the next months 
management believes that cash flow from operating activities together with available borrowings under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet core molding technologies liquidity needs 
however  if a material adverse change in the financial position of core molding technologies should occur  or if actual sales or expenses are substantially different than what has been forecasted  core molding technologies liquidity and ability to obtain further financing to fund future operating and capital requirements could be negatively impacted 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet transactions the company has the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on the company s balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
based on this definition  the table below includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  and after total debt line of credit interest operating lease obligations contractual commitments for capital expenditures postretirement benefits total future interest payments in the above table include the entire  of construction loans related to the new matamoros manufacturing facility  however  only  has been drawn at december  interest is calculated based the effective interest rates on the company s borrowing arrangements reflective of the interest rate swap agreements in place for the long term borrowings 
as of december   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  workers compensation and self insurance healthcare accruals  post retirement benefits  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value 
table of contents of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  management also records estimates for chargebacks such as customer returns  customer rework chargebacks  discounts offered to customers  and price adjustments 
should these customer returns  chargebacks  discounts  and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts  additional allowances may be required 
the company recorded allowances for chargebacks of  at december  and  at december  inventories inventories  which include material  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories are accounted for using the first in  first out fifo method of determining inventory costs 
inventory quantities on hand are regularly reviewed  and where necessary  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based on historical and anticipated usage 
the company has recorded an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory of  at december  and  at december  goodwill and long lived assets management evaluates whether impairment exists for goodwill and long lived assets annually on december or at interim periods if an indicator of impairment exists 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine impairment  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  decreases in future cash flows from operating activities that are below our assumptions could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to recover its long lived assets 
the company has not recorded any impairment to goodwill for long lived assets for the years ended december  and a decrease in future cash flows would not adversely impact the net book value of goodwill and a increase in the rate used to discount future cash flows would not adversely impact the net book value of goodwill 
self insurance the company is self insured with respect to most of its columbus and batavia  ohio and gaffney  south carolina medical and dental claims and columbus and batavia  ohio workers compensation claims 
the company has recorded an estimated liability for self insured medical and dental claims incurred but not reported and worker s compensation claims incurred but not reported at december   and of  and  respectively 
post retirement benefits management records an accrual for postretirement costs associated with the health care plan sponsored by core molding technologies 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine the reserves  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  increases in future healthcare costs above the assumptions could have an adverse effect on core molding technologies operations 
the effect of a change in healthcare costs is described in note of the consolidated notes to financial statements 
core molding technologies recorded a liability for postretirement healthcare benefits based on actuarially computed estimates of  at december   and  at december  the decrease in the liability is attributable to unrecognized gains of  and benefit payments of  recorded in this was offset by increases to the liability of  related to service and interest costs 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time products are shipped and title transfers 
allowances for returned products  chargebacks and other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized 
tooling revenue is recognized when the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership 
progress billings and expenses are shown net as an asset or liability on the company s balance sheet 
tooling in progress can fluctuate significantly from period to period and is dependent upon the stage of tooling projects and the related billing and expense payment timetable for individual projects and therefore does not necessarily reflect projected income or loss from tooling projects 
at december  the company has recorded a net liability related to tooling in progress of  which represents approximately  of progress tooling billings and  of progress tooling expenses 
at december  the company had recorded a net liability related to tooling in progress of  which represents approximately  of progress tooling billings and  of progress tooling expenses 
income taxes management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance and has not recorded a valuation allowance due to anticipating it being more likely than not that the company will realize these benefits 
an analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
such analysis is based upon the premise that the company is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s relationships with its two largest customers navistar and paccar  and the company s recent customer diversification efforts 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of its relationships with its key customers  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of  management recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination 
management has recognized all tax positions as of december  the deferred tax asset of  at december  primarily includes temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of  as well as temporary differences between the book and tax value for inventory reserves and accrued liabilities of approximately  inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
with the current economic conditions  inflation may not be a great concern  however  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
