item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form k 
patents  trademarks and other intellectual property the company believes that the success of its business depends more on the technical competence  creativity and marketing abilities of its employees than on any individual patent  trademark or copyright 
nevertheless  as part of its ongoing research  development and manufacturing activities  gardner denver has a policy of seeking to protect its proprietary products  product enhancements and processes with appropriate intellectual property protections 
in the aggregate  patents and trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacture and marketing of many of gardner denver s products 
however  the company does not consider any single patent or trademark  or group of patents or trademarks  to be material to its business as a whole  except for the gardner denver trademark 
other important trademarks the company uses include  among others  aeon  belliss morcom  bottarini  champion  compair  cycloblower  drum  duroflow  elmo rietschle  emco wheaton  hoffman  hydrovane  lamson  legend  nash  oberdorfer  opi  quantima  reavell  sutorbilt  tamrotor  thomas  todo  webster  welch and wittig 
pursuant to trademark license agreements  cooper has rights to use the gardner denver trademark for certain power tools 
gardner denver has registered its trademarks in the countries where it deems necessary or in the company s best interest 
the company also relies upon trade secret protection for its confidential and proprietary information and routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees as well as its suppliers and other third parties receiving such information 
there can be no assurance  however  that these protections are sufficient  that others will not independently obtain similar information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or that they can effectively be protected

environmental matters the company is subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage  handling  emission  disposal and discharge of materials into the environment 
the company believes that its existing environmental control procedures are adequate and it has no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area 
gardner denver has an environmental policy that confirms its commitment to a clean environment and compliance with environmental laws 
gardner denver has an active environmental management program aimed at compliance with existing environmental regulations and developing methods to eliminate or significantly reduce the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although these laws impose joint and several liability  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
based on currently available information  gardner denver was only a small contributor to these waste sites  and the company has  or is attempting to negotiate  de minimis settlements for their cleanup 
the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially 
table of contents complete and the company s future obligations entail a share of the sites ongoing operating and maintenance expense 
the company is also addressing three on site cleanups for which it is the primary responsible party 
two of these cleanup sites are in the operation and maintenance stage and the third is in the implementation stage

based on currently available information  the company does not anticipate that any of these sites will result in material additional costs beyond those already accrued on its balance sheet

item a 
risk factors we have exposure to the risks associated with the current global economic crisis  which may negatively impact our revenues  liquidity  suppliers and customers 
as widely reported  financial markets in the united states  europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
these economic developments negatively affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways 
the adverse economic conditions in the united states  europe and asia result in decreased demand for our products  which in turn have a negative effect on our revenues and net income 
additionally  the current global credit crisis may prohibit our customers and suppliers from obtaining financing for their operations  which could result in i disruption to our supply deliveries or our inability to obtain raw materials at favorable pricing  ii decrease in orders of our products or the cancellations thereof  and iii our customers inability to pay for our products 
furthermore  the volatility in security prices may adversely affect the value of the assets in the company s pension plans  which may  in turn  result in increased future funding requirements and pension cost 
the company is unable to predict the severity or the duration of the current disruptions in the financial markets and the adverse economic conditions in the united states  europe and asia 
however  a prolonged period of economic decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and exacerbate the other risk factors described below 
we may not realize the expected financial benefits from the acquisition of compair and from recently announced restructuring actions 
on october   we completed our acquisition of compair 
achieving the expected benefits of this acquisition will require us to increase the revenues of compair  successfully integrate the compair operations with our own and realize certain anticipated synergies 
additionally  certain integration and restructuring actions identified prior to the acquisition have been accelerated to deal with slowing end market demand 
if we are unable to integrate our businesses successfully or implement these restructuring actions effectively  then we may fail to realize the 
table of contents anticipated synergies and growth opportunities or achieve the cost savings and revenue growth we anticipated from these actions 
we operate in cyclical markets  which may make our revenues and operating results fluctuate 
demand for some of our fluid transfer products is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs and oil and natural gas prices 
the energy market  in particular  is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for these commodities is depressed  the demand for our products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced 
accordingly  our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period as the markets for our products have historically experienced cyclical downturns in demand 
the current global economic crisis and future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we face robust competition in the markets we serve  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we actively compete with many companies producing the same or similar products 
depending on the particular product  we experience competition based on a number of factors  including price  quality  performance and availability 
we compete against many companies  including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the economy as a whole 
in addition  new competitors could enter our markets 
if we cannot compete successfully  our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
large or rapid increases in the costs of raw materials or substantial decreases in their availability and our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our primary raw materials  directly and indirectly  are cast iron  aluminum and steel 
although we have a limited number of long term contracts with key suppliers and are seeking to enter into additional long term contracts  we do not have long term contracts with most of our suppliers 
consequently  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials 
factors such as supply and demand  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and dealers  the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price of raw materials 
we use single sources of supply for certain iron castings  motors and other select engineered components 
from time to time in recent years  we have experienced a disruption to our supply deliveries and may experience further supply disruptions  particularly during the current global economic crisis should one or more suppliers become insolvent 
any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely meet our commitments to customers and  therefore  our operating results 
an increasing percentage of our sales and operations are in non us jurisdictions and is subject to the economic  political  regulatory and other risks of international operations 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states 
we have manufacturing facilities in germany  the united kingdom  china  brazil  italy  sweden  finland and canada 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available 
non us operations and non us export sales could be adversely affected as a result of nationalization of private enterprises  political or economic instability in certain countries  especially during the current global economic crisis  differences in foreign laws  including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights  
table of contents changes in the legal and regulatory policies of foreign jurisdictions  credit risks  currency fluctuations  in particular  changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar  the euro  the british pound sterling and the chinese yuan  exchange controls  changes in tariff restrictions  royalty and tax increases  export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments  potential problems obtaining supply of raw materials  shipping products during times of crisis or war  and other factors inherent in foreign operations 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets  the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
as of december   the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately billion  or of our total assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets  including goodwill  are assigned to the operating divisions based upon their fair value at the time of acquisition 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually 
if the carrying amount of an operating division exceeds its fair value  we could be required to record non cash impairment charges in our net income 
such non cash impairment charges  if significant  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized  reduce our consolidated stockholders equity and increase our debt to total capitalization ratio  which could negatively impact our credit rating  existing debt covenants and access to public debt and equity markets 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility 
we have debt of approximately million at december   and our indebtedness could have an adverse future effect on our business 
for example we may have a limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  restructuring costs  execution of our growth strategy  or other purposes  a portion of our cash flow will be used to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  the various covenants contained in our credit agreement  the indenture covering the senior subordinated notes  and the documents governing our other existing indebtedness may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to some of our competitors  and borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
the nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims  which could harm our business 
customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property  equipment or the environment 
in addition  our products are integral to the production process 
table of contents for some end users and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects 
we maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size 
however  we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred 
we also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable 
we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used 
our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse impact 
the availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is intense 
however  we provide long term equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers  including change in control agreements  which provide incentives for them to make a long term commitment to our company 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we may not be able to continue to identify and complete strategic acquisitions and effectively integrate acquired companies to achieve desired financial benefits 
we have completed acquisitions since becoming an independent company in we expect to continue making acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise 
however  we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions 
furthermore  our existing operations may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources  which would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
even if we can complete future acquisitions  we face significant challenges in consolidating functions and effectively integrating procedures  personnel  product lines  and operations in a timely and efficient manner 
the integration process can be complex and time consuming  may be disruptive to our existing and acquired businesses  and may cause an interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  those businesses 
even if we can successfully complete the integration of acquired businesses into our operations  there is no assurance that anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements will be realized within the expected time frame  or at all 
we face risks associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
we have both funded and unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide 
as of december   our projected benefit obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately million unfunded status 
estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these benefit plans are based on various assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  rates of compensation increases  expected long term rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates 
while we believe that the assumptions are appropriate  significant differences between actual results and estimates  significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes  could adversely affect our financial results 
we have invested the plan assets of our funded benefit plans in various equity and debt securities 
a deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from the current global economic crisis  or otherwise  could cause the unfunded status of these benefit plans to increase  thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to these plans 
an obligation to make contributions to our benefit plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses  and may have an adverse impact on our operations  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents the risk of regulatory non compliance could have a significant impact on our business 
our global operations subject us to regulation by us federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws  regulations and policies  which could result in conflicting legal requirements 
noncompliance with any applicable laws could result in enforcement actions  fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation 
in addition  changes in current legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  data protection  international trade or compliance requirements could adversely affect our operations  revenues and earnings as well as require us to modify our strategic objectives 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 
our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and workplace safety 
under such laws and regulations  we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and regulations 
we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are  or have been  used for industrial purposes 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws 
an accrued liability on our balance sheet reflects costs which are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters 
if we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations  we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with regulatory requirements relating to environmental matters  and many environmental laws impose joint and several liability for remediation for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination  or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
communication or information systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our clients 
our business is highly dependent on financial  accounting and other data processing systems and other communications and information systems  including our enterprise resource planning tools 
we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems 
if any of these systems do not function properly  we could suffer financial loss  business disruption  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation 
if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions  our ability to grow could be limited 
although we have back up systems in place  we cannot be certain that any systems failure or interruption  whether caused by fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  acts of terrorism or war or otherwise will not occur  or that back up procedures and capabilities in the event of any failure or interruption will be adequate 
we are a defendant in certain asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources  and typically we are one of approximately or more named defendants 
in our experience to date  the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which we bear responsibility 

table of contents we believe that the pending lawsuits are not likely to  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants  could cause a different outcome 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality provisions  contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties  from time to time we may receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents  trademarks or other proprietary rights of such third party 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be costly and time consuming  and can divert management s attention and other resources 
depending on the resolution of such claims  we may be barred from using a specific technology or other right  may be required to redesign or re engineer a product  or may become liable for significant damages 
our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages or other labor difficulties 
as of january  we have approximately  full time employees 
a significant number of our employees  including a large portion of the employees outside of the us  are represented by works councils and labor unions 
although we do not anticipate future work stoppages by our union employees  there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur 
although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages  we cannot be assured that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements  that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor  that negotiations or other union matters will not divert management s attention away from operating the business or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations 
in addition  proposed legislation  known as the employee free choice act  could make it significantly easier for union organizing efforts in the us to be successful and could give third party arbitrators the ability to impose terms of collective bargaining agreements upon us and a labor union if we and such union are unable to agree to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement 
the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs and or decreased operating results

outlook in general  the company believes that demand for compressor and vacuum products tends to correlate with the rate of total industrial capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial production industrial machinery because air is often used as a fourth utility in the manufacturing process 
over longer time periods  the company believes that demand also tends to follow economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gross domestic product gdp around the world 
during  total industrial capacity utilization rates in the us  as published by the federal reserve board  declined below and to the lowest level since rates above have historically indicated a good demand environment for industrial equipment such as compressor and vacuum products 
the rapid decline in industrial production in the us and europe has resulted in reduced levels of capacity utilization and deferred purchases of capital equipment such as compressor packages 
order backlog consists of orders believed to be firm for which a customer purchase order has been received or communicated 
however  since orders may be rescheduled or canceled  backlog does not necessarily reflect future sales levels 
in  orders for compressor and vacuum products increased million  or  to  million  compared to  million in order backlog for the compressor and vacuum products segment increased to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase in orders reflected the effect of acquisitions million  and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates million  partially offset by reduced demand across most product lines as a result of the global economic downturn 
orders for compressor and vacuum products declined during the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in the increase in order backlog reflected the effect of acquisitions million  partially offset by reduced demand in most product lines and geographic regions 
the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced backlog by approximately million  or  compared to december   due primarily to strengthening of the usd against the eur and gbp during the end of the third quarter and during the fourth quarter of future demand for petroleum related fluid transfer products has historically corresponded to market conditions  rig counts and expectations for oil and natural gas prices  which the company cannot predict 
orders for fluid transfer products increased to million in  compared to million in  due primarily to strong demand for drilling pumps during the second and third quarters of the year  largely offset by lower demand for well servicing pumps and loading arms 
orders for fluid transfer products declined during the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in beginning in the fourth quarter of  declining energy prices led certain oil and gas exploration and production companies to lower their spending expectations and to a lower expected 
table of contents average rig count in north america in the company is uncertain how long petroleum pump orders will remain at these levels 
order backlog for the fluid transfer products segment declined to million at december   compared to million at december  an increase in backlog for petroleum pumps compared with a very low backlog in was partially offset by large orders for well stimulation pumps and loading arms received in which did not recur in the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced backlog by approximately million  or  compared to december   due primarily to strengthening of the usd against the eur and gbp during the second half of the deteriorating worldwide economic conditions and financial crisis have clouded the company s visibility into many of its key end market segments and it remains cautious in its outlook for in the third quarter of  demand began to slow in north america and western europe and  during the fourth quarter  decelerated further in those markets and began to decline in end market segments in asia and eastern europe 
the company expects to see demand improve first in its shorter lead time products that are more susceptible to swings in the economy  such as those that serve light industry and class trucks and oem s products for medical and environmental applications 
the company has not yet seen any indications that demand is improving 
during  the company accelerated its implementation of lean enterprise techniques  which created near term pressure on gross profit and operating margins as production levels  lead times and inventories were reduced 
future benefits are expected to be realized through the reduction of manufacturing lead time and resulting operating margin improvements 
the company believes these initiatives will lead to operating margin improvements in the long term and improved manufacturing flexibility to respond more quickly to increases in demand when end market conditions improve 
although end market conditions deteriorated more quickly than expected during the second half of  the company responded with previously developed contingency plans  including a reduction of the global salaried workforce  implementation of a hiring freeze and strict controls on discretionary spending 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed the closure of two manufacturing facilities in the us and the transfer of their activities into existing locations 
it also announced the closure of a large manufacturing facility in the uk and consolidation into an existing compair facility  which is expected to be substantively completed during the fourth quarter of the company continues to identify and evaluate further cost reduction and rationalization opportunities 
based on the uncertain economic outlook  the company estimates that it may incur restructuring costs of approximately million consisting primarily of employee termination benefits for further consolidation of manufacturing capacity in actual restructuring costs incurred in will be dependent on  among other things  the length and severity of the current economic downturn

the million reduction in accounts receivable was due primarily to reduced shipment volume during the fourth quarter of days sales outstanding  excluding compair  increased to in compared to in  due largely to an increase in revenues outside the us  which typically carry longer payment terms 
the net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflects lower production volume and material order rates during the fourth quarter of and a reduction in customer advance payments

in accordance with sfas no 
 the total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  were million and represented the unfunded status of the company s defined benefit plans at the end of the total pension and other postretirement benefit liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line items accrued liabilities  postretirement benefits other than pensions and other liabilities 
because this liability is impacted by  among other items  plan funding levels  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and investment return on plan assets  it does not represent expected liquidity needs 
accordingly  the company did not include this liability in the contractual cash obligations table 
the company funds its us qualified pension plans in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction 
the company is committed to making the required minimum contributions and expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its us qualified pension plans during furthermore  the company expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its postretirement health care benefit plans during future contributions are dependent upon various factors including the performance of the plan assets  benefit payment experience and changes  if any  to current funding requirements 
therefore  no amounts were included in the contractual cash obligations table 
the company generally expects to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
the company s non us pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations 
the company expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its non us qualified pension plans during no amounts have been included in the contractual cash obligations table due to the same reasons noted above 
disclosure of amounts in the contractual cash obligations table regarding expected benefit payments in future years for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans 
in order to inform the reader about expected benefit payments for these plans over the next several years  the company anticipates the annual benefit payments for the us plans to be in the range of approximately million to million in and to remain at or near these annual levels for the next several years  and the annual benefit payments for the non us plans to be in the range of approximately million to million in and to increase by approximately million each year over the next several years 
during the third quarter of  the company implemented certain revisions to its three defined benefit 
table of contents pension plans in the united kingdom and adjusted the net periodic benefit cost associated with these plans see note benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company had approximately million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
these unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual cash obligations table due to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of settlement with taxing authorities 
net deferred income tax liabilities were million as of december  this amount is not included in the contractual cash obligations table because the company believes this presentation would not be meaningful 
net deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling net deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading  because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
in the normal course of business  the company or its subsidiaries may sometimes be required to provide surety bonds  standby letters of credit or similar instruments to guarantee its performance of contractual or legal obligations 
as of december   the company had million in such instruments outstanding and had pledged million of cash to the issuing financial institutions as collateral for such instruments 
contingencies the company is a party to various legal proceedings  lawsuits and administrative actions  which are of an ordinary or routine nature 
in addition  due to the bankruptcies of several asbestos manufacturers and other primary defendants  among other things  the company has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
the company has also been named as a defendant in a number of silicosis personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically the company is one of approximately or more named defendants 
in the company s experience to date  the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which the company bears responsibility 
predecessors to the company sometimes manufactured  distributed and or sold products allegedly at issue in the pending asbestos and silicosis litigation lawsuits the products 
however  neither the company nor its predecessors ever mined  manufactured  mixed  produced or distributed asbestos fiber or silica sand  the materials that allegedly caused the injury underlying the lawsuits 
moreover  the asbestos containing components of the products were enclosed within the subject products 
the company has entered into a series of cost sharing agreements with multiple insurance companies to secure coverage for asbestos and silicosis lawsuits 
the company also believes some of the potential liabilities regarding these lawsuits are covered by indemnity agreements with other parties 
the company s uninsured settlement payments for past asbestos and silicosis lawsuits have not been material 
the company believes that the pending and future asbestos and silicosis lawsuits are not likely to  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  based on the company s anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to address the risks of such matters  the limited potential asbestos exposure from the components described above  the company s experience that the vast majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the products or for which the company otherwise bears responsibility  various potential defenses available to the company with respect to such matters  and the company s prior disposition of comparable matters 
however  due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and because future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants  could cause a different outcome  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for 
table of contents related natural resource damages 
persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although these laws impose joint and several liability  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
based on currently available information  the company was only a small contributor to these waste sites  and the company has  or is attempting to negotiate  de minimis settlements for their cleanup 
the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially complete and the company s future obligations entail a share of the sites ongoing operating and maintenance expense 
the company is also addressing three on site cleanups for which it is the primary responsible party 
two of these cleanup sites are in the operation and maintenance stage and the third is in the implementation stage 
the company is also participating in a voluntary cleanup program with other potentially responsible parties on a fourth site which is in the assessment stage 
based on currently available information  the company does not anticipate that any of these sites will result in material additional costs beyond those already accrued on its balance sheet 
the company has an accrued liability on its balance sheet to the extent costs are known or can be reasonably estimated for its remaining financial obligations for these matters 
based upon consideration of currently available information  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial condition  liquidity or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal  state  local or foreign environmental laws or regulations  or cleanup costs relating to the sites discussed above

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
management believes that the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements related to these areas are based on their best judgments and estimates  although actual results could differ materially under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability to fully collect amounts due from its customers 
the allowance is determined based on a combination of factors including the length of time that the receivables are past due and the company s knowledge of circumstances relating to specific customers ability to meet their financial obligations 
if economic  industry  or specific customer business trends worsen beyond earlier estimates  the company may increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
inventory reserves inventories  which consist of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
fixed manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facility 
unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred 
as of december   million of the company s inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out fifo basis with the remaining million accounted for on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets  including goodwill  are assigned to the operating divisions based upon their fair value at the time of acquisition 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization but are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired or that there is a probable reduction in the fair value of an operating division below its aggregate carrying value 
the company performs the impairment test at the operating division level during the third quarter of each fiscal year using balances as of june the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable operating divisions with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
the company determines the fair value of its operating divisions using assumptions based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows and a discount rate that is based upon the cost of capital specific to the company reflective of a market transaction between market participants 
the company believes that these assumptions are reasonable and comply with gaap 
if the carrying amount of an operating division exceeds its fair value  the company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of 
table of contents impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected operating division s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the company accounts for long lived assets  including intangible assets that are amortized  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires that all long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  such as reductions in demand for the company s products or significant economic slowdowns in the company s end markets  reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset to be held and used is impaired 
such reviews involve a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its remaining useful life 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to its fair value or  if fair value is not readily determinable  to an estimated fair value based on discounted expected future cash flows 
the impairment to be recognized as a non cash charge to earnings is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to dispose 
the company performed its impairment testing during the third quarter of using balances as of june and determined that the carrying values of intangible assets not subject to amortization and goodwill were not impaired 
subsequent to the company s annual impairment test  worldwide economic activity deteriorated due to credit conditions resulting from the financial crisis 
as a result  the company experienced a significant slowdown in orders and lowered projected near term earnings levels compared to management s expectations at the end of the second quarter of in addition  the company s common stock price declined during the second half of causing the market capitalization of the company to drop to a level slightly above its book value at december  based on the combination of these factors  the company concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require the performance of interim goodwill and long lived assets impairment analyses as of december  as a result of the interim impairment analyses  the company concluded that no impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles had occurred 
as part of these analyses  the company performed additional impairment testing of one of its operating divisions as events and changes in circumstances indicated that goodwill and other intangibles assets assigned to this division may have been impaired 
upon completion of the additional testing procedures  the company determined that the fair value of this operating division exceeded its aggregate carrying value 
the company also determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to its long lived assets were in excess of their carrying values  and therefore these assets were not impaired 
in performing these interim impairment analyses  the company considered both the current and long term projected level of earnings and cash flows generated by its businesses  and management s expectations about the depth and duration of the current economic downturn 
the company does not believe that the near term economic challenges are indicative of the long term economic outlook for its businesses and the end markets it serves 
it is possible that these assumptions may change if the economic environment continues to deteriorate or remains depressed at current levels for an extended period of time 
in such circumstances the company may record non cash impairment charges relating to its goodwill and long lived assets and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
warranty reserves the company establishes reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based upon historical warranty experience and additionally for any known product warranty issues 
the company s products typically carry a one year warranty 
although the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  the company s warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
employee medical and workers compensation benefit claims the company maintains accruals for estimated medical and workers compensation claims incurred  but unpaid or not reported 
the accruals are based on a number of factors  including historical experience and recent claims 
table of contents history  and are subject to ongoing revision as conditions change and new data becomes available 
in estimating the liability for medical claims  the company uses analyses of prior medical claims history provided by an independent third party firm 
business combinations when the company acquires a business  the purchase price is allocated to the tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
management generally engages independent third party appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
the measurement of acquired contractual and contingent liabilities in connection with an acquired business also requires management to make significant estimates which may be subject to a certain degree of variability 
the company may establish a liability for the estimated cost of restructuring actions for which management has begun to assess and formulate a plan as of  or prior to  the consummation date of the acquisition 
this liability is included in the purchase price allocation for acquisitions consummated on or before december   and may include the estimated cost of the closure and consolidation of facilities and voluntary and involuntary employee termination and relocation benefits 
to the extent the actual cost of these plans varies from the amount estimated within one year of the date of acquisition  the purchase price allocation will be adjusted for acquisitions consummated on or before december  stock based compensation the company accounts for share based payment awards in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under sfas r  share based payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period 
determination of the fair values of share based payment awards at grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of the relevant share based awards and the expected volatility of the company s stock 
additionally  management must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected term of share based awards represents the period of time that the share based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over the expected term of the award 
expected forfeitures are based on historical experience 
pension and other postretirement benefits gardner denver sponsors a number of pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide 
the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors 
these assumptions include the discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations  future rate of compensation increases  expected rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates 
the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations as of december  and were derived by examining the rates of high quality  fixed income securities whose cash flows or duration match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments under the plans 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized through net periodic benefit cost over future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost 
actuarial valuations associated with the company s pension plans at december  used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
a decrease in 
table of contents the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the company s annual pension expense by approximately million 
please refer to note benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to gardner denver s benefit plans  including quantitative disclosures reflecting the impact that changes in certain assumptions would have on service and interest costs and benefit obligations 
income taxes the calculation of the company s income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments 
as part of the company s analysis and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to the tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors us and international tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the company s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments utilized in determining the income tax provision  and records adjustments as necessary 
loss contingencies contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of the potential loss 
the most significant contingencies impacting the company s financial statements are those related to product warranty  personal injury lawsuits  environmental remediation and the resolution of matters related to open tax years 
for additional information on these matters  see note summary of significant accounting policies  note income taxes and note contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments all derivative financial instruments are reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges  any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the current period 
a derivative instrument may be designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in expected future cash flows if the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period of designation 
if a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged asset  liability or firm commitment is recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is immediately recognized in earnings 
gains or losses on derivative instruments recognized in earnings are reported in the same line item as the associated hedged transaction in the consolidated statements of operations 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when it is determined that a derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  the derivative is sold  terminated or exercised  the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur within two months of the originally specified time period 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge  the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value 
when cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative is sold  terminated  or exercised  the net gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings or until it becomes unlikely that a hedged forecasted transaction will occur within two months of the originally scheduled time period 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because a hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the balance 
table of contents sheet and recognized as a gain or loss currently in earnings 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur within two months of the originally specified time period  the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized immediately through earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks during the normal course of business  including those presented by changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to these risks is managed through a combination of operating and financing activities 
the company selectively uses derivative financial instruments  including forwards and swaps  to manage the risks from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  and currency exchange rates can be volatile  and the company s risk management activities do not totally eliminate these risks 
consequently  these fluctuations could have a significant effect on the company s financial results 
notional transaction amounts and fair values for the company s outstanding derivatives  by risk category and instrument type  as of december  and  are summarized in note off balance sheet risk  concentrations of credit risk and fair value of financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  principally aluminum 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including cast iron  aluminum  copper  and steel 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company has long term contracts with some of its suppliers of key components 
however  to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk results primarily from its borrowings of million at december  the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed and variable rate debt and uses pay fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt in order to adjust the relative proportions 
the interest rates on approximately of the company s borrowings were effectively fixed as of december  if the relevant libor amounts for all of the company s borrowings had been basis points higher than actual in  the company s interest expense would have increased by million 
exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the company s operations is conducted by its subsidiaries outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar 
almost all of the company s us subsidiaries conduct their business primarily in their local currencies  which are also their functional currencies 
other than the us dollar  the euro  british pound  and chinese yuan are the principal currencies in which the company and its subsidiaries enter into transactions 
the company is exposed to the impacts of changes in currency exchange rates on the translation of its non us subsidiaries assets  liabilities  and earnings into us dollars 
the company partially offsets these exposures by having certain of its non us subsidiaries act as the obligor on a portion of its borrowings and by denominating such borrowings  as well as a portion of the borrowings for which the company is the obligor  in 
table of contents currencies other than the us dollar 
of the company s total net assets of  million at december   approximately million was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
borrowings by the company s us subsidiaries at december  totaled million  and the company s consolidated borrowings denominated in currencies other than the us dollar totaled million 
fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates in the value of non us dollar borrowings that have been designated as hedges of the company s net investment in foreign operations are included in other comprehensive income 
the company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the risk that arises when they  from time to time  enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency 
to mitigate this risk  the company and its subsidiaries typically settle intercompany trading balances monthly 
the company also selectively uses forward currency contracts to manage this risk 
at december   the notional amount of open forward currency contracts was million and their aggregate fair value was million 
to illustrate the impact of currency exchange rates on the company s financial results  the company s operating income would have decreased by approximately million if the us dollar had been percent more valuable than actual relative to other currencies 
this calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion to the us dollar and that there are no indirect effects of the change in the value of the us dollar such as changes in non us dollar sales volumes or prices
