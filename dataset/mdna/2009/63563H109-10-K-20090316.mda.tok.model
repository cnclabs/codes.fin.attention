overview we own and operate dental laboratories located in states and one canadian province  serving an active customer base of over  dentists 
our business consists of the design  fabrication  marketing and sale of custom dental prosthetic appliances for dentists located primarily in the domestic marketplace 
our products are grouped into the following three main categories restorative products 
restorative products that our dental laboratories sell consist primarily of crowns and bridges 
a crown replaces the part of a tooth that is visible  and is usually made of gold  porcelain or zirconia 
a bridge is a restoration of one or more missing teeth that is permanently attached to the natural teeth or roots 
in addition to the traditional crown  we also make porcelain jackets  which are crowns constructed entirely of porcelain  onlays  which are partial crowns which do not cover all of the visible tooth  and precision crowns  which are restorations designed to receive and connect a removable partial denture 
we also make inlays  which are restorations made to fit a prepared tooth cavity and then cemented into place 
reconstructive products 
reconstructive products sold by our dental laboratories consist primarily of partial dentures and full dentures 
partial dentures are removable dental prostheses that replace missing teeth and associated structures 
full dentures are dental prostheses that substitute for the total loss of teeth and associated structures 
we also sell precision attachments  which connect a crown and an artificial prosthesis  and implants  which are fixtures anchored securely in the bone of the mouth to which a crown  partial or full denture is secured by means of screws or clips 
cosmetic products 
cosmetic products sold by our dental laboratories consist primarily of porcelain veneers and ceramic crowns 
porcelain veneers are thin coverings of porcelain cemented to the front of a tooth to enhance personal appearance 
ceramic crowns are crowns made from ceramic materials that most closely replicate natural teeth 
we also sell composite inlays and onlays  which replace silver fillings for a more natural appearance  and orthodontic appliances  which are products fabricated to move existing teeth to enhance function and appearance 
recent trends we believe that the economic recession in the united states has negatively impacted the entire dental laboratory industry  as price sensitive consumers postpone elective dental work 
the increasing severity of the current economic crisis  coupled with rising unemployment and problems in the housing and credit markets has further eroded consumer confidence 
additionally  we believe that the low cost segment for united states manufactured dental prosthetics has declined as competition from offshore laboratories  primarily those located in china  has become more intensive 
while our business has not traditionally focused on this low cost segment of the market  certain customers are sensitive to price competition 
as a result  these increasing competitive pressures have restrained somewhat our ability to increase prices 
since  these increasing competitive pressures in the form of low price competition have been partially responsible for decreasing revenues or revenue growth in several marketplaces 
in  we partnered with dentsply prident to offer a high quality  economical restoration manufactured in china with fda registered materials for those practices that are more price focused than our typical customer 
we believe that this strategic product offering  which has been made available in select marketplaces based upon individual customer needs and is coupled with patient level disclosures regarding country of origin  materials and our satisfaction guarantee  provides our dentists with a risk free  outsourced restoration 
in addition  we face growing competition from technology based solutions that allow dentists to fabricate their own restorations without the use of a dental laboratory 
these trends appear to be restraining industry growth  and have impacted our results of operations 
the main components of our costs are labor and related employee benefits as well as raw materials  including precious metals such as gold and palladium 
over the past several years  competition for labor resources and 
table of contents increases in medical insurance costs  as well as volatility in the prices of many precious metals that we use have driven these costs higher 
in  we evaluated and adjusted staffing levels  as appropriate  at each of our locations  while continuing to recognize the need to maintain an available and properly trained workforce 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into  we have continued to proactively reduce staffing levels to improve profitability and eliminate excess capacity in response to the economic recession and the decline in consumer discretionary spending 
we have also focused on reducing discretionary operating expenses to manage through the current recessionary environment 
additionally  technology based dental laboratory cad cam manufacturing solutions have required us to make additional investments in capital equipment 
our ability to afford and utilize these cad cam systems provides us the opportunity to centrally produce product for many of our laboratories at more efficient and profitable levels 
we are focusing on more completely leveraging this technology investment to reduce labor costs 
therefore  we believe that these investments are critical to our long term business strategy 
acquisitions we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions  which have played an important role in helping us increase sales from  in to  in in march  we completed the acquisition of green dental laboratories  inc green 
green is treated as a separate reportable segment for financial reporting purposes 
in october  we completed our largest acquisition to date  that of keller group  incorporated keller of st 
louis  missouri 
keller is also treated as a separate reportable segment for financial reporting purposes 
most recently  in september  we completed the acquisition of dental art laboratories  inc dental art of lansing  michigan 
our consolidated statement of income reflects the financial results of dental art for the last four months of fiscal the acquisition of keller has broadened our marketing strategies and product offerings 
in recent years keller has changed its focus from local markets in the midwest to the national marketplace 
in order to sustain this strategy  keller invests significantly in product advertising  primarily in dental print publications and direct mail  on products that can generate strong revenue growth 
one of these products is the nti tss plus tm device nti  an alternative to full coverage bite guards that is also approved by the fda for use in the treatment of medically diagnosed migraine pain and jaw disorders 
sales growth for nti  for which keller holds a long term  exclusive product license  was approximately  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal we have used long term debt to finance the purchase of green  keller and dental art 
future acquisitions may also be funded using available debt financing 
as a result of these acquisitions  we are more highly leveraged than we were previously 
our interest expense has therefore become a more significant component of our pre tax earnings 
interest expense in was  compared to  in and  in however  due primarily to lower interest rates  interest expense declined from  for to  for  which contains four months of interest expense related to the debt that funded the acquisition of dental art 
overview of results of operations for the year ended december   sales increased  to  net sales increased by approximately  as a result of the dental art acquisition 
net sales decreased approximately  at dental laboratories owned for the full year ended december  and furthermore  approximately  of sales growth was attributable to the effect of increased prices due to the underlying increases in the prices of precious metals passed through to customers  without which sales growth would have been further negative 
the decline in sales was primarily attributable to decreased patient demand  particularly in the fourth quarter of  resulting from the drop in consumer discretionary spending as the recession deepened 
excluding the acquisition of dental art  sales declined  in the fourth quarter of sales growth in the fourth quarter of for keller  relative to their performance in the first nine months of  was flat at  or 
in the fourth quarter  sales declined  at green and  at the ndx laboratories 
for the year ended december   gross profit decreased by  compared to the year ended december  within our cost of sales  employee benefits costs  primarily health insurance costs  increased 
table of contents by  as a result of higher claims experience 
labor costs increased by approximately  including  in cost of sales  over the prior year as a result of base pay increases  including raises related to a modification of the laboratory incentive compensation plan the laboratory plan 
the former plan was designed to reward operating efficiency 
the modified plan is now designed to provide incentives for growth in profits 
as a result of these and other design changes  the reported amounts of laboratory incentive compensation are significantly less this year than in the past 
conversely  labor expenses are somewhat higher within both cost of goods sold and operating expenses with laboratory incentive compensation decreasing by  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the end of the second quarter 
based on our initial assessment for  the fair value of our business units exceeded their carrying value and therefore our goodwill was not impaired 
as economic conditions worsened in the fourth quarter and our business performance and outlook was not as strong as anticipated at the end of the second quarter  management determined that circumstances had changed enough to perform an additional goodwill impairment test as of december  the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value is determined by using an income approach  consistent with our valuation of dental laboratories acquired in purchase business combinations 
we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  based on a multiple of annual earnings 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and profit margin percentages  and future market conditions  among others 
our projections are based on an internal forecasts and a business review 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered to be impaired 
however  if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the analysis we completed for december  determined that the fair value of ten dental laboratories in the ndx laboratories operating segment was less than their carrying value 
the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for the laboratories which step one indicated were impaired 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
in determining the fair value of assets we utilize valuations of certain intangible assets  including trade names and customer relationships 
the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to these laboratories exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in goodwill impairment of  as of december   we had  of goodwill remaining on our consolidated balance sheet 
within operating expenses  increases in deferred compensation accruals and market declines in the investment values of related insurance policies combined to increase expenses by  primarily as a result of rising fuel costs in  delivery costs increased  as a result of the factors discussed above  particularly the impairment of goodwill  income before provision for income taxes decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources on august  we entered into an amended and restated financing agreement the amended agreement with bank of america  na the bank 
the amended agreement included a revolving line of credit of  a revolving acquisition line of credit of  and a term loan facility of  the interest rate on both revolving lines of credit and the term loan was the prime rate or  at our option  libor  a cost of funds rate  or the bank s fixed rate plus a range of to depending on the ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the amended agreement 
the amended agreement required monthly payments of principal on the term loan  based on a seven year amortization schedule  with a final payment 
table of contents due on the fifth anniversary of the amended agreement 
the amended agreement required compliance with certain covenants  including the maintenance of specified net worth  income and other financial ratios 
in october we borrowed against our acquisition line of credit to finance our acquisition of keller 
in order to refinance the borrowings incurred for the keller acquisition  we and the bank executed a second amended and restated loan agreement as of november  the second agreement comprising uncollateralized senior credit facilities totaling  the second agreement amended and restated the amended agreement a to increase the term loan facility to an aggregate principal amount of  and used the proceeds of the increase in the term loan to repay the portion of the outstanding principal balance under the acquisition line of credit and b to adjust the allocation of availability under the lines of credit by increasing the revolving line of credit to   of which may be used for future acquisitions and decreasing the acquisition line of credit from  to  the interest rate on both lines of credit and the term loan was the prime rate or  at our option  libor  a cost of funds rate or the bank s fixed rate  plus  in each case  a range of to  depending on the ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as each is defined in the second agreement 
the term loan facility portion of the second agreement requires monthly interest payments and monthly payments of principal  based on a seven year amortization schedule  with a final payment due on the fifth anniversary of the second agreement 
the second agreement requires compliance with certain covenants  including the maintenance of specified net worth  minimum consolidated total ebitda  debt to income ratio and other financial ratios 
the second agreement was amended on may   effective march   to revise certain financial targets within these covenants 
additionally  we and the bank agreed to consolidate the revolving line of credit with the acquisition line of credit into a single line of credit of  to be used by us for general corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions 
the second agreement was also amended on september  on account of the acquisition of dental art  which increased our outstanding debt and therefore required an adjustment to an affected financial covenant 
we further amended the agreement on december  to extend the maturity of the line of credit to november  the amendment changed the interest rate on both the line of credit and the term loan to prime rate or  at our option  libor  a cost of funds rate  or the bank s fixed rate  plus  in each case  a range of to  depending on the ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as each is defined in the second agreement and increased the commitment fee on the unused portion of the line of credit from 
to 
in addition  the amendment revised certain financial targets within the covenants 
finally  on march   we amended the second agreement to exclude the  goodwill impairment discussed previously from the calculation of ebitda  used in determining our compliance with certain financial covenants 
these amendments did not change the total availability under the second agreement

table of contents results of operations our results are reported within three operating segments  ndx laboratories  green dental and keller 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in our consolidated financial statements years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment operating income other expense interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales in  competitive pressures from offshore laboratories that can produce crowns at fees lower than crowns manufactured in the united states have limited our ability to raise our prices  particularly during a time when we have experienced relatively higher costs for precious metals used in manufacturing 
in addition  these competitive pressures are partially responsible for declines in revenues or revenue growth in several marketplaces 
we also believe that since the beginning of  the recessionary environment in the united states impacted our revenues and the revenues of the entire dental laboratory industry  as price sensitive consumers postpone elective dental work 
the impact of the recession on our business was particularly noticeable in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   net sales increased  or over year ended december  net sales increased by approximately  as a result of the dental art acquisition in september excluding the dental art acquisition  net sales decreased approximately  for the full year ended december  as compared to furthermore  approximately  of sales growth was attributable to the effect of increased prices due to underlying increases in the prices of precious metals passed through to customers 
the decline in sales for laboratories held more than one year was primarily attributable to decreased patient demand  particularly in the fourth quarter of as consumers started to delay certain dental work due to economic uncertainties 
excluding acquired sales from dental art  sales declined  in the fourth quarter of sales growth in the fourth quarter of for keller  relative to their performance in the first nine months of  was flat at  or 
in the fourth quarter  sales declined  at green and  at the ndx laboratories 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased by  or in the year ended december  over the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold increased from to  primarily resulting from increases in labor and related benefits  increases in laboratory overhead and rising materials costs 
green s labor costs of of sales  as compared to in  and keller s labor costs of of sales  as compared to in  lowered the overall percentage while the portion attributable to ndx laboratories increased to of sales for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  included in the increase in the ndx laboratories segment is a reclassification of approximately  in 
table of contents base pay increases related to modifications of the laboratory plan  which is discussed above 
laboratory overhead increased  primarily as a result of increased depreciation and rent for new facilities and increases in technical training 
excluding the acquisition of dental art  production labor and related benefits increased by approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the cost of raw materials as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  for most of  the average cost of gold and palladium  precious metals components of many dental alloys  was on the rise 
however  by the end of  due to decreased global demand for palladium  the average price of palladium was essentially unchanged  while gold increased by approximately over average costs in the prior year 
although we were able to pass a majority of precious metal cost increases on to our customers  prolonged higher metal costs have had and likely will continue to have a negative impact on gross profit percentages 
selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses  net of goodwill impairment and consisting of selling  delivery and administrative expenses both at the laboratory and corporate level  increased by  for the year ended december  compared to operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from in to in as a percentage of net sales  delivery expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in selling expenses increased from of sales for the year ended december  to in selling expenses in for the keller segment were of sales  or  laboratory incentive compensation decreased from of sales in to in  as the amount decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  in the net increase of  in our operating expenses in was primarily attributable to the following increases additional operating and amortization expense associated with the dental art acquisition  increases in delivery costs  resulting primarily from cost increases in fuel and delivery services  increases in selling expenses  including  in increased marketing expense at keller and  in increased sales compensation  offset by decreases in customer rewards program expenses of   increases in administrative expenses at the laboratory level  including  in increased compensation primarily resulting from increases to base pay of  related to the change in the laboratory plan  offset by decreases to depreciation expense and losses on asset disposals of   increases in salaries and benefits at the corporate level  and  decrease of the cash surrender value of life insurance policies as a result of market value declines  net of decreases in the related deferred compensation accruals for our supplemental executive retirement plans  partially offset by decreases in laboratory incentive compensation as a result of the laboratory plan restructuring  decreases in executive incentive compensation accruals due to our financial results  and decrease in amortization due to fully amortized non compete agreements  goodwill impairment our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the end of the second quarter 
based on our initial assessment for  the fair value of our business units exceeded their carrying value and therefore our goodwill was not impaired 
as economic conditions worsened in the fourth quarter and our business performance and outlook was not as strong as anticipated at the end of the second quarter  management determined 
table of contents that circumstances had changed enough to perform an additional goodwill impairment test as of december  based on our evaluation of goodwill  we determined that the fair value of ten dental laboratories in the ndx laboratories operating segment was less than their carrying value  resulting in goodwill impairment of  operating income as a result of the above factors  our operating income decreased by  to  for the year ended december  from  in as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased from in to in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates  interest expense declined from  for to  for approximately  of interest expense was related to the borrowings that funded the acquisition of dental art 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  however  for the year ended december   income before provision for income taxes was  and the effective tax rate was therefore 
the reason the tax provision exceeds income before provision for income taxes is due to the tax impact of the impairment of goodwill 
goodwill impairment recorded in the amount of  has an associated tax benefit of only  as approximately of the goodwill impairment charge is not deductible for tax purposes 
without the impact of goodwill impairment  our tax provision would have resulted in an effective tax rate of  which would have represented a decrease from the effective tax rate for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate before adjustment for goodwill impairment was due in part to recognition of research and experimentation credits of  offset by increases in the amount of certain non deductible expenses 
net income as a result of all the factors discussed above  particularly the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter  net income decreased  to  or per share on a diluted basis for the year ended december  from  or per share on a diluted basis in operating segment results our business consists of a single industry segment  which is the design  fabrication  marketing and sale of custom dental prosthetic appliances for and to dentists in north america 
we report on three operating segments within this single industry segment 
these three segments are known as green dental  representing the operations of green dental laboratories  inc of heber springs  arkansas  which we acquired in march  keller  representing the operations of keller group  incorporated with laboratories in st

sales growth in the fourth quarter of for keller  relative to their performance in the first nine months of  was flat at  or 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily as a result of improved labor efficiency  partially offset by increased materials cost  including precious metals 
delivery costs increased by  which primarily is the result of increased delivery service charges due to higher volume and increased fuel costs 
as a result  delivery costs as a percentage of sales rose to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  advertising expense increased by  for the year ended december  compared to due to increased marketing activities

year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   net sales increased  or over the prior year 
net sales increased by approximately  primarily as a result of acquisitions measured by business at dental laboratories owned less than one year 
net sales decreased approximately  at dental laboratories owned for both the year ended december  and the year ended december   primarily as a result of sales declines in the ndx laboratories operating segment 
competitive pressures from offshore laboratories that can produce crowns at fees lower than crowns manufactured in the united states continue to limit our ability to raise our prices during a time when we have experienced relatively higher costs for precious metals used in manufacturing 
in addition  these competitive pressures are partially responsible for declines in revenues or revenue growth in several marketplaces 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased by  or in the year ended december  over the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased from to  primarily resulting from decreases in labor and related benefits  partially offset by increases in materials expense and laboratory overhead 
excluding acquisitions  production labor and related benefits decreased by approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to reductions in our staffing levels at certain laboratories 
the cost of raw materials as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in the average cost of precious metals used as components of many dental alloys  including gold and palladium  increased by approximately for gold and for palladium over average costs in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  the average cost of gold increased by over the average cost in the fourth quarter of although we are able to pass a portion of precious metal cost increases on to our customers  prolonged higher metal costs have had and likely will continue to have a negative impact on gross profit percentages 
overall  labor expense as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  improved over the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  production labor and related benefits declined from in to in green s labor costs of of sales and keller s labor costs of of sales lowered the overall percentage while the portion attributable to ndx laboratories decreased to of sales for the year ended december  from for the year ended december

table of contents net income as a result of all the factors discussed above  net income increased  to  or per share on a diluted basis for the year ended december  from  or per share on a diluted basis in operating segment results our business consists of a single industry segment  which is the design  fabrication  marketing and sale of custom dental prosthetic appliances for and to dentists in north america 
we report on three operating segments within this single industry segment 
these three segments are known as green dental  representing the operations of green dental laboratories  inc of heber springs  arkansas which we acquired in march  keller  representing the operations of keller group  incorporated with laboratories in st 
louis  missouri and louisville  kentucky  which we acquired in october   and ndx laboratories  which represents our remaining laboratories  including impact dental laboratory limited  which we acquired in october  year ended december change change revenue ndx laboratories green dental keller subtotal less inter segment revenues ndx laboratories green dental keller net sales laboratory operating income ndx laboratories green dental keller laboratory operating income ndx laboratories for the year ended december   sales growth in this segment of consisted of a reduction in same laboratory sales offset by in sales growth attributable to the october acquisition of impact 
the reduction in internal sales resulted primarily from the loss of certain customers as we consolidated certain laboratories and departments  with the goal of improving long term profitability 
several laboratories in this segment also experienced lower unit volumes as they were impacted by increased competitive pressures in the form of low price competition 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  cost of goods sold decreased by  the decrease was attributable to decreases in manufacturing labor and benefits of approximately  primarily resulting from reductions in staffing levels and associated decreases in health insurance costs and decreases in the cost of materials of approximately  offset by additional costs related to acquisitions of  and laboratory overhead increases of approximately  resulting from new facilities and higher energy costs 
laboratory operating income as a percentage of sales for ndx laboratories increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed above 

table of contents green dental for the year ended december   internal sales growth in this segment was 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily the result of increases in materials cost  including precious metals 
laboratory operating income as a percentage of sales for green declined from for the year ended december  and to for the year ended december  the decline was primarily attributable to increased selling expenses  primarily compensation  and lower property disposal gains 
keller this segment resulted from our acquisition of keller group  inc effective october  while sales growth in the first nine months of was all attributable to the acquisition  sales in the fourth quarter of grew by over the fourth quarter of  the first in which we owned keller 
keller operates with manufacturing efficiencies but also is pursuing growth with significant spending in product advertising  primarily in dental print publications and direct mail 
as a result  while keller returned lower net operating margins than our other operating segments  it has achieved significantly higher sales growth 
laboratory operating income as a percentage of sales improved to for the year ended december  compared to for the quarter ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales improved to for the year ended december  compared to for the quarter ended december  critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
as released by the sec requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of certain of our significant accounting policies is presented below 
summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss  generally as the dentists orders are shipped 
we record shipping and handling fees charged to customers as revenues in accordance with eitf accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
shipping and handling costs totaled approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  and are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill amortization ceased on december  we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the value of goodwill has been impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis  based on a two step process 
our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the end of the second quarter 
based on our initial assessment for  the fair value of our business units exceeded their carrying value and therefore our goodwill was not impaired 
as economic conditions worsened in the fourth quarter and our business performance and outlook was not as strong as anticipated at the end of the second quarter  management determined that circumstances had changed enough to perform an additional goodwill impairment test as of december  the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value is determined by using an income approach  consistent with our valuation of dental laboratories acquired in purchase business combinations 
we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  based on a multiple of annual earnings 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature 
table of contents and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and profit margin percentages  and future market conditions  among others 
our projections are based on an internal forecasts and a business review 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered to be impaired 
however  if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the analysis we completed for december  determined that the fair value of ten dental laboratories in the ndx laboratories operating segment was less than their carrying value 
the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for the laboratories which step one indicated were impaired 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
in determining the fair value of assets we utilize valuations of certain intangible assets  including trade names and customer relationships 
the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to these laboratories exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in goodwill impairment of  as of december   we had  of goodwill remaining on our consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  we also recognize the existence of value in trade names acquired in business combinations and believe the useful life of this intangible to be indefinite 
accordingly  trade names are also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis using a single step method in accordance with sfas no 
impairment charges related to trade names are recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset 
impairment charges of   and  were recorded in the year ended december   and  respectively 
trade name impairment charges generally result from a decline in forecasted revenue at specific laboratories in comparison to revenue forecasts used in previous valuation calculations 
intangible assets subject to amortization we follow the applicable accounting pronouncements specifically sfas no 
business combinations and emerging issues task force abstract recognition of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in a business combination eitf  in accounting for purchase business combinations 
non competition agreements and customer relationship intangibles arising from dental laboratory acquisitions are amortized over their useful lives 
the acquisition date fair value of non competition agreements are deferred and amortized over their economic useful lives  in accordance with the terms of the agreements  ranging from to years 
the acquisition date fair value associated with acquired customer relationships are amortized over their estimated economic useful life  ranging from to years 
inventories inventories  consisting principally of raw materials  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we use estimates based on specific identification to maintain proper reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
additionally  we estimate work in process inventories by applying current labor  materials and selected overhead expense rates to standard production schedules 
we estimate the value of unrefined precious metal scrap based on the application of various return and refining statistics 
finished goods inventory consists of completed orders that were shipped to customers immediately subsequent to period end 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated depreciable lives buildings years furniture and fixtures years laboratory equipment years computer equipment years 
table of contents leasehold improvements and capital leases are amortized over the lesser of the assets estimated useful lives or the lease terms 
gains and losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation expense totaled approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal impairment of long lived assets at each balance sheet date  management evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  using certain financial indicators  such as historical and future ability to generate income from operations 
our policy is to assess whether an impairment exists in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the determination is based on an evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant event  a significant change in the environment in which the business operates or if the expected future cash flows become less than the carrying amount of the asset 
cash surrender of life insurance the cash surrender value of life insurance policies are recorded at net realizable value 
income taxes we follow sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
the amount of deferred tax asset or liability is based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we have considered our current financial characteristics as well as current tax law and do not believe that the recoverability of various tax assets and liabilities is impaired  and therefore have recorded them at their full value 
we also follow fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the minimum threshold is defined in fin as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas and sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value which are provided in the table below 
sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis 
the adoption of both sfas and sfas had no impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fsp that partially deferred the effective date of sfas for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and removed certain leasing transactions from the 
table of contents scope of sfas sfas as amended by this fsp is effective for nonfinancial assets and liabilities in fiscal years beginning after november  and will be applied prospectively 
the provisions of sfas are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we use the market approach technique to value our financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during the year ended december  our financial assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of investments in insurance contracts held as assets to satisfy outstanding retirement liabilities 
sfas no 
requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices  interest rates  and yield curves 
level inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data 
the following table presents information about our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  there were no liabilities that required disclosure quoted prices in significant other significant as of december  active markets observable inputs unobservable inputs description level level level financial assets cash surrender value of life insurance total financial assets recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fas no 
revised  business combinations fas r 
fas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements  the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
fas r is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combination we enter into after december  will be subject to this new standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposure includes potential price volatility of commodities we use in our manufacturing processes 
we purchase dental alloys that contain gold  palladium and other precious metals 
we have not participated in hedging transactions 
we have relied on pricing practices that attempt to pass some portion  if not all  of our increased costs on to our customers  in conjunction with materials substitution strategies 
our market risk exposure also includes investments in insurance contracts held as assets to satisfy outstanding retirement liabilities  a portion of which are subject to market value fluctuations of the underlying investment 
at december   we had variable rate debt of million 
based on this amount  the earnings and cash flows impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately  net of tax  holding other variables constant 
we have investments in a foreign subsidiary 
the net assets of this subsidiary are exposed to volatility in current exchange rates 
we have determined that the effect of a change in exchange rates would be immaterial to our results of operations and financial position
