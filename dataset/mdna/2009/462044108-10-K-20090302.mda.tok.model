seismic industry overview since the s  oil and gas companies have sought to reduce exploration risk by using seismic data to create an image of the earth s subsurface 
seismic data is recorded when listening devices placed on the earth s surface or seabed floor  or carried within a streamer cable on a towed streamer vessel  measure how long it takes for sound vibrations to echo off rock layers underground 
for seismic acquisition onshore  the acoustic energy producing the sound vibrations is generated by the detonation of small explosive charges or by large vibroseis vibrator vehicles 
in marine acquisition  the energy is provided by a series of air guns that deliver highly compressed air into the water column 
the acoustic energy propagates through the subsurface as a spherical wave front  or seismic wave 
interfaces between different types of rocks will both reflect and transmit this wave front 
onshore  the reflected signals return to the surface where they are measured by sensitive receivers that may be either analog coil spring geophones or digital accelerometers based on mems micro electro mechanical systems technology  offshore  the reflected signals are recorded by either hydrophones towed in an array behind a streamer acquisition vessel or by multicomponent geophones or mems sensors that are placed directly on the seabed 
once the recorded seismic energy is processed using advanced algorithms and workflows  images of the subsurface can be created to depict the structure  lithology rock type  fracture patterns  and fluid content of subsurface horizons  highlighting the most promising places to drill for oil and natural gas 
this processing also aids in engineering decisions  such as drilling and completion methods  as well as decisions affecting overall reservoir production 
typically  an e p company engages the services of a geophysical acquisition company to prepare site locations  coordinate logistics  and acquire seismic data in a selected area 
the e p company generally relies upon third parties such as ion to provide the contractor with equipment  navigation and data management software  and field support services necessary for data acquisition 
after the data is collected  the same geophysical contractor  a third party data processing company  or the e p company itself will process the data using proprietary algorithms and workflows to create a series of seismic images 
geoscientists then interpret the data by reviewing the images and integrating the geophysical data with other geological and production information such as well logs or core information 
during the s  digital seismic data acquisition systems which converted the analog output from the geophones into digital data for recording and computers for seismic data processing were introduced 
using the new systems and computers  the signals could be recorded on magnetic tape and sent to data processors where they could be adjusted and corrected for known distortions 
the final processed data was displayed in a form known as stacked data 
computer filing  storage  database management  and algorithms used to process the raw data quickly grew more sophisticated  dramatically increasing the amount of subsurface seismic information 
until the early s  the primary commercial seismic imaging technology was two dimensional  or d  technology 
d seismic data is recorded using straight lines of receivers crossing the surface of the earth 
once processed  d seismic data allows 
table of contents geoscientists to see only a thin vertical slice of the earth 
a geoscientist using d seismic technology must speculate on the characteristics of the earth between the slices and attempt to visualize the true three dimensional d structure of the subsurface 
the commercial development of d imaging technology in the early s was an important technological milestone for the seismic industry 
previously  the high cost of d seismic data acquisition techniques and the lack of computing power necessary to process  display  and interpret d data on a commercial basis had slowed its widespread adoption 
today s d seismic techniques record the reflected energy across a series of closely spaced seismic lines that collectively provide a more holistic  spatially sampled depiction of geological horizons and  in some cases  rock and fluid properties  within the earth 
d seismic data and the associated computer based interpretation platforms allowed geoscientists to generate more accurate subsurface maps than could be constructed on the basis of the more widely spaced d seismic lines 
in particular  d seismic data provided more detailed information about subsurface structures  including the geometry of bedding layers  salt structures  and fault planes 
the improved d seismic images allowed the oil and gas industry to discover new reservoirs  reduce finding and development costs  and lower overall hydrocarbon exploration risk 
driven by faster computers and more sophisticated mathematical equations to process the data  the technology advanced quickly 
as commodity prices decreased and the pace of innovation in d seismic imaging technology slowed in the late s  e p companies slowed the commissioning of new seismic surveys 
also  business practices employed by geophysical contractors in the s impacted demand for seismic data 
in an effort to sustain higher utilization of existing capital assets  geophysical contractors increasingly began to collect speculative seismic data for their own account in the hopes of selling it later to e p companies 
contractors typically selected an area  acquired data using generic acquisition parameters and generic processing algorithms  capitalized the acquisition costs  and attempted to sell the survey results to multiple e p companies 
these generic  speculative  multi client surveys were not tailored to meet the unique imaging objectives of individual clients and caused an oversupply of seismic data in many regions 
additionally  since contractors incurred most of the costs of this speculative seismic data at the time of acquisition  contractors lowered prices to recover as much of their fixed investment as possible  which drove operating margins down 
the fundamentals of the oil and gas exploration and production industry and the seismic sector improved markedly beginning in as commodity prices increased  e p companies increased their capital investment programs  which drove higher demand for our products and services 
in july  oil prices reached an all time high of nearly per barrel 
sentiment changed dramatically in september as adverse global economic conditions began to affect demand for a wide variety of products and services throughout the world  including the demand for both oil and refined products  such as gasoline and natural gas 
by the end of  oil prices had fallen to roughly per barrel  and e p companies began to curtail their investment programs  announcing spending cuts that exceeded in some cases 
as a consequence  seismic acquisition contractors began to scale back their investments in new seismic hardware and software  while e p companies moved to optimize their spending on seismic data processing services and the purchase of seismic data libraries 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information 
ion geophysical s business strategy beginning in and continuing until the fourth quarter of  we observed increased spending for seismic services and equipment by e p companies and seismic contractors  driven in part by an increase in commodity prices 
a decline in the number and size of new discoveries  production declines in known reservoirs  and expanded demand for hydrocarbons had increased the pressure on e p companies to discover additional fields and optimize the recovery of those already on production 
until the fourth quarter of  this increasing exploration activity combined with higher commodity price levels increased the demand for seismic technology and services 
additionally  e p companies were focusing on hydrocarbon reservoirs located in deeper waters or deeper in the geologic column 
these reservoirs are generally more complex or subtle than the reservoirs that were discovered in prior decades and are located in unconventional reservoir types such as tar sand deposits or tight gas locked within hard rock  low permeability shales 
as a result  the process of finding and developing these hydrocarbon deposits is proving to be more challenging  which in turn results in escalating costs and increasing demands for newer and more efficient imaging technologies 
moreover  as e p companies may increasingly use seismic data to enhance production from known fields by repeating time lapse seismic surveys over a defined area  we believe that seismic companies such as ion can benefit because the repeat application of seismic extends the utility of subsurface imaging beyond exploration and into production monitoring  which can last for decades 
we also believe that e p companies will increasingly use seismic technology providers who will collaborate with them to tailor surveys that address specific geophysical problems and to apply advanced digital sensor and imaging technologies to take into account the geologic peculiarities of a specific area 
in the future  we expect that these companies will rely less on undifferentiated  mass 
table of contents seismic studies created using analog sensors and traditional processing technologies that do not adequately identify geologic complexities 
in  we acquired two companies  which were important in our evolution from being primarily a seismic equipment provider to becoming a broad based seismic solutions provider our acquisition of concept systems holdings limited concept systems and its integrated planning  navigation  command control  and data management software and solutions for towed streamer and seabed operations  and our acquisition of gx technology corporation gxt  and its advanced seismic data imaging solutions services and seismic data libraries for the marine environment 
additionally  in september  we further expanded our land system offerings through the acquisition of aram systems ltd 
and canadian seismic rentals inc sometimes collectively referred to herein as aram 
we acquired aram for the purpose of advancing our strategy and market penetration in the land seismic recording system business 
through these and other acquisitions  along with our research and development efforts  our technologies and services now include seismic data acquisition hardware  command and control software  value added services associated with seismic survey design  seismic data processing and interpretation  and seismic data libraries 
the dramatic changes that occurred in the fourth quarter of and continued into have caused us to re evaluate and refine our business strategy 
during late  disruption in the us financial markets prompted a global economic crisis  which adversely affected economic activity in most regions of the world and led to a tightening of the availability of commercial credit 
many economists are now predicting a prolonged worldwide economic recession and a slow recovery in the credit markets 
since the global economic crisis began to unfold  crude oil prices have rapidly declined from a peak oil price of per barrel in july to approximately per barrel in december hydrocarbon price erosion has caused e p companies to decrease their capital expenditure plans for exploration and production activities  which  in turn  adversely impacts the demand for many of our products and services 
unlike many other seismic companies  we participate only in the technology side of the business and are mainly involved in the planning  processing and interpretation of data services 
we do not provide the actual contracting services  and  as a result  do not have large capital expenditures that are required to fund land and marine seismic crews 
our costs are therefore much more variable than most other seismic companies  which provides greater flexibility in difficult economic times 
during the fourth quarter of and continuing into  we have been re evaluating our business strategy to ensure that it remains consistent with the commercial realities of our customers and a market guided by dramatically lower commodity prices 
we also have re evaluated and made necessary reductions in our cost structure to better align with necessary changes in strategy and to adjust to the current levels of demand 
for example  we observed a severe slowdown in sales activity for our land acquisition systems in north america and russia 
as a result  we have reduced employee headcount across our company by approximately in december and january  with the most reduction concentrated within the land imaging systems segment 
we believe that our current headcount is sufficient to manage our business and serve our customers needs during in all segments  but we may make further adjustments as market conditions and our strategy dictate 
in addition to analyzing employee resources  we have evaluated current and planned internal and external programs  including research and development  to ensure that each program is serving a worthwhile goal in the most efficient manner 
we are a technology solutions company and we rely upon our research and development programs to ensure that we offer products capable of solving complex imaging problems around the world efficiently 
the recent declines in oil and natural gas prices do not change the universally accepted facts that the oil and gas industry still suffers from declines in the number and size of new discoveries and production declines in known reservoirs 
these facts  combined with growing global demographics  support a conclusion of continuing long term demand for hydrocarbons 
in the current difficult economic environment  we believe that our technologies and services are ideal tools for e p companies seeking ways to be more productive in a lower price environment 
as a result  we have focused much of our research and development efforts on strategic programs that are seeking efficient and cost effective solutions for the challenges in the current market and also in a recovered economy 
a key element of our business strategy  which started with the acquisition of gxt in  has been to understand the challenges faced by e p companies in survey planning  acquisition  processing and even interpretation  and to strive to develop and offer technology and services that enable us to work with the e p companies to solve their challenges 
we have found that a collaborative 
table of contents relationship with e p companies  with a goal of better understanding their imaging challenges and then working with them and our contractor customers to assure that the right technologies are properly applied  is the most effective method for meeting our customers needs 
this strategy of being a full solutions provider to solve the most difficult challenges for our customers is an important element of our long term business strategy  and we are implementing this approach globally through local personnel in our regional organizations who possess an intimate understanding of the unique challenges in their areas 
in summary  our business strategy is predicated on successfully executing seven key imperatives continuing to manage our cost structure to reflect current market and economic conditions while keeping key strategic technology programs progressing with an overall goal of enabling e p companies to solve their complex reservoir problems most efficiently and effectively  expanding our ion solutions business in new regions with new customers and new land and marine service offerings  including proprietary services for owners and operators of oil and gas properties  globalizing our ion solutions data processing business by opening advanced imaging centers in strategic locations  and expanding our presence in the land seismic processing segment  with emphasis on serving the emerging national oil companies  developing and introducing our next generation of marine towed streamer products  with a goal of developing markets beyond the new vessel market  expanding our seabed imaging solutions business using our vectorseis ocean vso acquisition system platform and derivative products to obtain technical and market leadership in what we continue to believe is a very important and expanding market  utilizing our recent aram acquisition as a framework to increase our market share and profitability in cable based land acquisition systems  and furthering the commercialization of firefly  our cableless full wave land data acquisition system  through sales and also through a services rental model to advance the diffusion rate 
the rapid decline of oil and natural gas prices in late makes it even more important for the e p industry to reduce the number of dry holes and to optimize the wells that are successful 
e p companies continue to be interested in technology to increase production and in improving their understanding of targeted reservoirs  in both the exploration and production phases 
we believe that our new technologies  such as firefly  digifin and orca  will continue to attract interest because they are designed to deliver improvements in image quality within more productive delivery systems 
for more information regarding our products and services  see products and services below 
full wave digital our seismic data acquisition products and services are well suited for traditional d  d  and d data collection as well as more advanced multicomponent or full wave digital seismic data collection techniques 
conventional geophone sensors are based on a mechanical  coil spring magnet arrangement 
the single component geophone measures ground motion in one direction  even though reflected energy in the earth travels in multiple directions 
this type of geophone can capture only pressure waves p waves 
p waves represent only a portion of the full seismic wavefield 
conventional geophones have limitations in collecting shear waves s waves  which involve a component of particle motion that is orthogonal to the direction of wave propagation a more horizontal component of motion 
in addition  geophones require accurate placement both vertically and spatially 
inaccurate placement  which can result from poorly planned surveys or human error  can introduce distortions that negatively affect the final subsurface image 
multicomponent seismic sensors are designed to record the full seismic wavefield by measuring reflected seismic energy in three directions 
this vector based measurement enables multicomponent sensors to record not only p wave data  but also to record shear waves 
ion s vectorseis sensor was developed using mems accelerometer technology to enable a true vector measurement of all seismic energy reflected in the subsurface 
vectorseis is designed to capture the entire seismic signal and more faithfully record all wavefields traveling within the earth 
by measuring both p waves and s waves  the vectorseis full wave sensor records a more 
table of contents complete and accurate seismic dataset having higher frequency content than conventional sensors 
when data recorded by vectorseis is processed using the advanced imaging techniques offered by our gxt imaging solutions group  we are able to deliver higher definition images of the subsurface to our oil and gas customers  which enables geophysicists to better identify subtle structural  rock  and fluid oriented features in the earth 
in addition  we believe that full wave technologies should deliver improved operating efficiencies in field acquisition and reduce cycle times across the seismic workflow  from planning through acquisition and final image rendering 
vectorseis acquires full wave seismic data in both land and marine environments using a portfolio of advanced imaging platforms manufactured by ion scorpion our cable based land acquisition system that replaced our system four system in late  vectorseis ocean vso our redeployable ocean bottom cable system for the seabed  and firefly our cableless full wave land acquisition system

our cable based scorpion and aries land acquisition systems consist of a central recording unit and multiple remote ground equipment modules that are connected by cable 
the central recording unit is in a transportable enclosure that serves as the control center of each system and is typically mounted within a vehicle or helicopter 
the central recording unit receives digitized data  stores the data on storage media for subsequent processing  and displays the data on optional monitoring devices 
it also provides calibration  status  and test functionality 
the remote ground equipment consists of multiple remote modules and line taps positioned over the survey area 
seismic data is collected by analog geophones or vectorseis digital sensors 
our aries product line was acquired in connection with our acquisition of aram in september the product line consists of analog cable based land acquisition systems and related peripherals and equipment 
aries land system products include remote 
table of contents acquisition modules rams  which acquire analog seismic data from the geophones and transmit the data digitally to the central processing equipment  and line tap units that interconnect baseline cables from the recording equipment to multiple receiver lines and function to retransmit data from the rams to central recording equipment 
aries products also include system batteries standard sealed or lithium ion  central recording equipment including seismic processing module and aram software  baseline cables that connect the central recording equipment with the taps and receiver line cables that connect geophones or hydrophone groups to a ram 
scorpion is capable of recording full wave seismic data 
digital sensors  while more expensive than traditional analog geophones  can provide increased response linearity and bandwidth  which translates into higher resolution images of the subsurface 
in addition  one digital sensor can replace a string of six or more analog geophones  providing users with equipment weight reduction and improved operating efficiencies 
scorpion contains numerous enhancements that are designed to reduce our manufacturing costs  improve system reliability and productivity  and enable higher station count acquisition 
during  we delivered scorpion land acquisition systems to oil and natural gas corporation limited  the national oil company of india 
each scorpion system is capable of recording with digital  full wave vectorseis sensors or analog geophones 
we began vectorseis technology land acquisition field tests in  and since that time vectorseis technology has been used to acquire seismic data in north america  europe  asia  the pacific basin region  the middle east  and the commonwealth of independent states 
in  we introduced our vectorseis system four land acquisition system 
in  we announced the introduction of our new hybrid system four platform  which gave seismic companies the flexibility to use both traditional analog geophone sensors and digital full wave vectorseis sensors on the same survey 
vectorseis is also used as the primary sensor device on our firefly cableless land acquisition system 
in november  we announced our development of firefly  a cableless system for full wave land seismic data acquisition 
by removing the constraints of cables  geophysicists can custom design surveys for multiple subsurface targets and increase receiver station density to more fully sample the subsurface 
we believe that the cableless design of firefly will improve field productivity while reducing concerns for health and safety and environmental liability exposure 
firefly s benefits include a decrease in system weight and  we believe  superior operational efficiencies  reduction in operational troubleshooting time  and better defined sampled seismic data 
also  we believe that the data management capabilities of firefly should reduce the amount of time spent pre processing the data 
during late and  we delivered an early version of our firefly system  which was used by british petroleum and then apache corporation  in field application projects located in wyoming and northeast texas  respectively 
an advanced version of our firefly system was successfully deployed in july on a multi client survey in northwest colorado in which pittsburgh based e p operator  east resources  served as the lead underwriter 
this initial deployment of the more advanced version of our firefly system was called durham ranch  after one of the large  privately held ranches in this ecologically sensitive area 
in early  ion sold its first commercial firefly system  which will be used in a producing hydrocarbon basin containing reservoirs that have been difficult to image with conventional seismic techniques 
geophones 
geophones are analog sensor devices that measure acoustic energy reflected from rock layers in the earth s subsurface using a mechanical  coil spring element 
we market a full suite of geophones and geophone test equipment that operate in most environments  including land  transition zone  and downhole 
we believe our sensor group is the leading designer and manufacturer of precision geophones used in seismic data acquisition 
our analog geophones are used in other industries as well 
vibrators and energy sources 
vibrators are devices carried by large vibroseis vehicles and  along with dynamite  are used as energy sources for land seismic acquisition 
we market and sell the ahv iv  an articulated tire based vibrator vehicle  and a tracked vibrator  the xvib  for use in environmentally sensitive areas such as the arctic tundra and desert environments 
our pelton division is a provider of energy source control and positioning technologies 
pelton s vib pro control system provides vibrator vehicles with digital technology for energy control and global positioning system technology for navigation and positioning 
pelton s shot pro dynamite firing system  released in  is the equivalent technology for seismic operations using dynamite energy sources 

table of contents marine imaging systems products products for our marine imaging systems business segment include the following marine acquisition systems 
our traditional marine acquisition system consists of towed marine streamers and shipboard electronics that collect seismic data in water depths greater than meters 
marine streamers  which contain hydrophones  electronic modules and cabling  may measure up to  meters in length and are towed up to at a time behind a towed streamer seismic acquisition vessel 
the hydrophones detect acoustical energy transmitted through water from the earth s subsurface structures 
our first digistreamer system  our next generation towed streamer system  was successfully commissioned at the start of the north sea season in the second digistreamer system was delivered during digistreamer uses solid streamer and continuous acquisition technology for towed streamer operations 
during  we introduced our vectorseis ocean vso system  an advanced system for seismic data acquisition using redeployable ocean bottom cable  and we shipped the first system to reservoir exploration technology  asa rxt  a norwegian seismic contractor 
during  we completed the delivery of our fifth vso system to rxt 
we have entered into a multi year agreement with rxt under which rxt has agreed to purchase a minimum of million in vso systems and related equipment from us through approximately million in purchase commitments remain under the agreement 
the agreement also entitles us to receive a royalty of of all revenues generated by rxt through the use of vso equipment from january through the end of the term of the agreement 
in turn  the agreement grants rxt exclusive rights to this product line through in  we recognized million of royalty income under this agreement 
marine positioning systems 
our digicourse marine streamer positioning system includes streamer cable depth control devices  lateral control devices  compasses  acoustic positioning systems  and other auxiliary sensors 
this equipment is designed to control the vertical and horizontal positioning of the streamer cables and provides acoustic  compass  and depth measurements to allow processors to tie navigation and location data to geophysical data to determine the location of potential hydrocarbon reserves 
digifin  our advanced lateral streamer control system  saw significant acceptance by the industry in with a total of nine systems delivered during the year 
digifin is designed to maintain tighter  more uniform marine streamer separation along the entire length of the streamer cable  which allows for better sampling of seismic data and improved subsurface images 
we believe that digifin also enables faster line changes and minimize the requirements for in fill seismic work 
source and source control systems 
we manufacture and sell air guns  which are the primary seismic energy source used in marine environments to initiate the acoustic energy transmitted through the earth s subsurface 
an air gun fires a high compression burst of air underwater to create an energy wave for seismic measurement 
we offer a digital source control system digishot  which allows for reliable control of air gun arrays for d exploration activities 
data management solutions products and services through this segment  we supply software systems and services for towed marine streamer and seabed operations 
software developed by our subsidiary  concept systems  is installed on towed streamer marine vessels worldwide and is a component of many redeployable and permanent seabed monitoring systems 
products and services for our data management solutions business segment include the following marine imaging 
orca is our next generation successor software product for towed streamer navigation and integrated data management applications 
during and  orca made significant inroads into the towed streamer market with several major seismic contractors adopting the technology for their new  high end seismic vessels 
orca includes modules designed to manage acquisition marine surveys integrating the navigation  source control  and streamer control functions 
orca can manage complex marine surveys such as time lapse d surveys and wats wide azimuth towed streamer surveys 
wats is an advanced acquisition technique for imaging complex structures for example  subsalt in the marine environment  generally implemented with multiple source vessels that shoot at some distance from the streamer recording vessel 
orca is designed to be compatible with our digifin product  which enables streamer lateral control  and digistreamer  ion s new marine streamer acquisition system 
spectra is concept systems legacy integrated navigation and survey control software system for towed streamer based d  d  and d seismic survey operations 
seabed imaging 
concept systems also offers gator  an integrated navigation and data management software system for multi vessel ocean bottom cable and transition zone such as marshlands operations 
the gator system is designed to provide real time  multi vessel positioning and data management solutions for ocean bottom  shallow water  and transition zone crews 

table of contents survey design  planning and optimization

post survey analysis tools 
concept systems command and control systems such as orca  spectra and gator are designed to integrate with its post survey tools for processing  analysis  and data quality control 
these tools include its sprint navigation processing and quality control software for marine geophysical surveys  and its reflex software for seismic coverage and attribute analysis 
ion solutions division services services for our ion solutions business segment include the following seismic data processing services 
the gxt imaging solutions group provides a variety of seismic data processing and imaging services to e p companies for marine  ocean bottom and land environments 
services include survey planning and design  project oversight of data acquisition operations  advanced signal processing  final image rendering  and geophysical and reservoir analysis 
the gxt imaging solutions group offers processing and imaging services through which it develops a series of subsurface images by applying its processing technology to data owned or licensed by its customers 
the group also provides support services to its customers  such as data pre conditioning for imaging and outsourced management of seismic data acquisition and image processing services 
the gxt imaging solutions group uses parallel computer clusters to process seismic data by applying advanced proprietary algorithms and workflows that incorporate techniques such as illumination analysis  data conditioning and velocity modeling  and time and depth migration 
pre stack depth migration involves the application of advanced  computer intensive processing techniques which convert time based seismic information to a depth basis 
while pre stack depth migration is not necessary in every imaging situation  it generally provides the most accurate subsurface images in areas of complex geology 
it also helps to convert seismic data  which is recorded in the time domain  into a depth domain format that is more readily applied by geologists and reservoir engineers in identifying well locations 
our reverse time migration rtm technology was developed to improve imaging in areas where complex structural conditions or steeply dipping subsurface horizons have provided imaging challenges for oil and gas companies 
our axis geophysics group axis  based in denver  colorado  focuses on advanced seismic data processing for stratigraphically complex onshore environments 
axis has developed a proprietary data processing technique called azim that is designed to better account for the anisotropic effects of the earth ie  different layers of geological formations that are not parallel to each other  which tend to distort seismic images 
azim is designed to correct for these anisotropic effects by producing higher resolution images in areas where the velocity of seismic waves varies with compass direction or azimuth 
the azim technique is used to analyze fracture patterns within reservoirs 
we believe that the application of ion s advanced processing technologies and imaging techniques can better identify complex hydrocarbon bearing structures and deeper exploration prospects 
we also believe that the combination of gxt s capabilities in advanced velocity model building and depth imaging  along with axis capability in anisotropic imaging  provides an advanced toolkit for maximizing the data measurements obtained by our vectorseis full wave sensor 
integrated seismic solutions iss 
ion s iss services are designed to manage the entire seismic process  from survey planning and design to data acquisition and management  through pre processing and final subsurface imaging 
the iss group focuses on the technologically intensive components of the image development process  such as survey planning and design and data processing and interpretation  and outsources the logistics component to geophysical logistics contractors 
ion offers its iss services to customers on both a proprietary and multi client basis 
on both bases  the customers pre fund a majority of the data acquisition costs 
with the proprietary service  the customer also pays for the imaging and processing  but has exclusive ownership of the data after it has been processed 
for multi client surveys  we assume some of the processing costs but retain ownership of the data and images and receive on going license revenue from subsequent data license sales 
seismic data libraries 
since  gxt has acquired and processed a growing seismic data library consisting of non exclusive marine and ocean bottom data from around the world 
the majority of the data libraries licensed by gxt consist of ultra deep d lines that e p companies use to better evaluate the evolution of petroleum systems at the basin level  including insights into the 
table of contents character of source rocks and sediments  migration pathways  and reservoir trapping mechanisms 
in many cases  the availability of geoscience data extends beyond seismic information to include magnetic  gravity  well log  and electromagnetic information  which help to provide a more comprehensive picture of the subsurface 
known as spans  these geophysical data libraries currently exist for major basins worldwide  including the northern gulf of mexico  in the southern caribbean  off the northern coast of south america  offshore west africa  offshore colombia  offshore india and offshore northern canada and alaska 
in  we completed the acquisition of our latest basin scale seismic survey library for the eastern java sea and the makassar straits  two prospective areas offshore indonesia and malaysia 
data for nearly  kilometers was acquired during the acquisition phase of this project 
additionally  we successfully completed the acquisition phase of a multi client seismic imaging project using our firefly cableless land acquisition system at durham ranch in northwest colorado 
additional spans are planned or under development for other regions of the world 
product research and development our research and development efforts have focused on improving both the quality of the subsurface image and the seismic data acquisition economics for our customers 
our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic equipment and data acquisition systems  as well as related processing services  depends principally upon continued technological innovation 
development cycles of most products  from initial conception through commercial introduction  may extend over several years 
in  we principally focused our research and development efforts on commercialization of our firefly system and on digistreamer  our solid streamer cable for marine acquisition 
firefly was deployed in july on a multi client survey at durham ranch  and we delivered the first commercial firefly system in early a digistreamer system was deployed in an open water test by fugro  a netherlands company  early in and was sold to fugro shortly thereafter 
as a result of current economic and market conditions  in we intend to reduce our overall spending on research and development projects 
during  we expect that our product development efforts will continue across selective business lines aimed at the development of strategic key products and technologies 
major research and development programs are expected to continue for firefly  our digi line of marine streamer technologies  our cable based land systems and our land energy source technologies 
a key research and development initiative is underway to integrate firefly with our cable based land recording systems in order to provide contractors with a hybrid architecture for cabled and cableless recording on the same survey 
we also are investing to develop hybrid sensor functionality for both aries ii and firefly 
the effort on aries ii involves making the current all analog system compatible with vectorseis  the effort on firefly involves making the current all digital system compatible with analog geophones 
for a summary of our research and development expenditures during the past five years  see item selected financial data

no assurance can be given concerning the successful development of any new products or enhancements  the specific timing of their release or their level of acceptance in the marketplace 
markets and customers based on historical revenues  we believe that we are a market leader in numerous product lines  including geophones  full wave sensors based upon micro electro magnetic systems mems  navigation and data management software  marine positioning and streamer control systems  cableless land acquisition systems and redeployable seabed recording systems 
our principal customers are seismic contractors and e p companies 
seismic contractors purchase our data acquisition systems and related equipment and software to collect data in accordance with their e p company customers specifications or for their own seismic data libraries 
we also market and sell products and offer services directly to e p companies  primarily imaging related processing services and multi client seismic data libraries from our gxt subsidiary  as well as consulting services from concept systems and gxt 
during the years ended december   and  no single customer accounted for or more of our consolidated net revenues 
until september  worldwide exploration activities had increased in response to increased hydrocarbon demand and diminishing supply from many regions 
as a result  the utilization of both land and marine seismic data acquisition products and services had increased significantly  with seismic contractors expanding their acquisition asset base and retrofitting existing assets with newer  more efficient technologies 
since the global economic crisis began to unfold late in the third quarter of  demand for products and services has fallen in all industrial sectors and in all regions 
the e p industry has been affected by a rapid fall off in 
table of contents prices for both natural gas and crude oil  with the latter falling from a peak of per barrel in july to approximately per barrel in december hydrocarbon price erosion has caused e p companies to revisit their capital investment plans  which  in turn  is reverberating back through the supply chain to affect us both directly and indirectly through our seismic acquisition contractor customers 
contractors from china and other countries are increasingly active not only in their own countries but also in other international markets 
as a result  a significant part of our marketing effort is focused on areas outside of the united states 
foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the united states  including the risk of armed conflict  civil disturbances  currency fluctuations  embargo and governmental activities  customer credit risks  and risk of non compliance with us and foreign laws  including tariff regulations and import export restrictions 
we sell our products and services through a direct sales force consisting of employees and international third party sales representatives responsible for key geographic areas 
during the years ended december   and  sales to destinations outside of north america accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net revenues  respectively 
further  systems sold to domestic customers are frequently deployed internationally and  from time to time  certain foreign sales require export licenses 
we have consolidated our international sales under a new entity operating in dubai 
dubai is geographically better positioned to ensure that we are close to our customers in the most active oil and gas centers of the world 
associated with this change will be a more effective tax structure that better reflects our global operations and better operational efficiencies for our international customers 
traditionally  our business has been seasonal  with strongest demand in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
for information concerning the geographic breakdown of our net revenues  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
manufacturing outsourcing and suppliers since  we have increased the use of contract manufacturers in our land and marine imaging systems business segments as an alternative to manufacturing our own products 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of our vibrator vehicles  our towed marine streamers  our redeployable ocean bottom cables  various components of vectorseis ocean and certain electronic and ground components of our land acquisition systems 
we may experience supply interruptions  cost escalations  and competitive disadvantages if we do not monitor these relationships properly 
these contract manufacturers purchase a substantial portion of the components used in our systems and products from third party vendors 
certain items  such as integrated circuits used in our systems  are purchased from sole source vendors 
although we and our contract manufacturers attempt to maintain an adequate inventory of these single source items  the loss of ready access to any of these items could temporarily disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell certain products 
since our components are designed for use with these single source items  replacing the single source items with functional equivalents could require a redesign of our components and costly delays could result 
in  we transferred ownership of our subsidiary  applied mems  inc  to colibrys ltd 
colibrys  a swiss mems based technology firm  in exchange for a ownership interest in colibrys 
we also entered into a five year supply agreement with colibrys that provides for colibrys to supply us with products on an exclusive basis in our markets 
colibrys manufactures micro electro mechanical system mems products  including accelerometers  for our vectorseis sensors  and for other applications  including test and measurement  earthquake and structural monitoring  and defense 
while we continue to believe that mems based sensors like our vectorseis sensors will increasingly be used in seismic imaging  we also believe that improvements in the design and manufacture of mems technology will also likely occur  that will require additional financial and human capital to achieve 
by outsourcing our mems manufacturing operations to a mems based technology firm such as colibrys  we believe that we are better positioned to leverage the research and development of these products and industries  improve gross margins on our vectorseis based products  and reduce our future investment requirements in mems technology 
we have no further obligations to fund colibrys with regard to any mandatory assessments or additional capital contribution requirements but we may choose to invest further capital into colibrys from time to time 

table of contents competition the market for seismic products and services is highly competitive and is characterized by continual changes in technology 
our principal competitor for land and marine seismic equipment is societe d etudes recherches et construction electroniques sercel  an affiliate of the french seismic contractor  compagnie general de geophysique veritas cggveritas 
sercel possesses the advantage of being able to sell its products and services to an affiliated seismic contractor that operates both land crews and seismic acquisition vessels  providing it with a greater ability to test new technology in the field and to capture a captive internal market for product sales 
sercel has also demonstrated that it is willing to offer extended financing sales terms to customers in situations where we declined to do so due to credit risk 
we also compete with other seismic equipment companies on a product by product basis 
our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic instruments and data acquisition systems depends principally upon continued technological innovation  as well as pricing  system reliability  reputation for quality  and ability to deliver on schedule 
certain seismic contractors have designed  engineered  and manufactured seismic acquisition technology in house or through a controlled network of third party vendors in order to achieve differentiation versus their competition 
for example  westerngeco a wholly owned subsidiary of schlumberger limited  a large integrated oilfield services company relies heavily on its in house technology development for designing  engineering  and manufacturing its q technology platform  which includes seismic acquisition and processing systems 
although this technology competes directly with ion s technology for marine streamer  seabed  and land acquisition  westerngeco does not provide q technology services to other seismic acquisition contractors 
however  the risk exists that other seismic contractors may decide to conduct more of their own seismic technology development  which would put additional pressures on the demand for ion acquisition equipment 
in addition  over the last several years  we have seen both new build and consolidation activity within the marine towed streamer segment  which could impact our business results in the future 
we expect the number of d and d marine streamer vessels  including those in operation  under construction  or announced additions to capacity  to increase to approximately by year end  compared to approximately at december  in addition  there has been an increase in acquisition activity within the sector  with the major vessel operators schlumberger  cggveritas  and pgs all moving to acquire new market entrants in the last several years 
many of these incumbent operators develop their own marine streamer technologies  such that consolidation in the sector reduces the number of potential customers and vessel outfitting opportunities for us 
our gxt imaging solutions group competes with more than a dozen processing companies that are capable of providing pre stack depth migration services to e p companies 
while the barriers to entry into this market are relatively low  the barriers to competing at the higher end of the market  which is the advanced pre stack depth migration market  where our efforts are focused  are significantly higher 
at the higher end of this market  cggveritas and westerngeco are ion solutions division s two primary competitors for advanced imaging services 
both of these companies are larger than ion in terms of revenues  number of processing locations  and sales and marketing resources 
in addition  both cggveritas and westerngeco possess an advantage of being part of affiliated seismic contractor companies  providing them with access to customer relationships and seismic datasets that require processing 
concept systems provides advanced data integration software and services to seismic contractors acquiring data using either towed streamer vessels or ocean bottom cable on the seabed 
vessels or ocean bottom cable crews that do not use concept systems software either rely upon manual data integration  reconciliation  and quality control  or develop and maintain their own proprietary software packages 
there is evidence of growing competition to concept systems core command and control business from sercel and other smaller companies 
concept systems has recently signed long term between and years technology partnerships with many of its key clients and will continue to seek to develop key new technologies with these clients 
an important competitive factor for companies in the same business as concept systems is the ability to provide advanced complex command and control software with a high level of reliability combined with expert systems and project support to ensure operations run cost effectively 
in the land systems market  ion is the second largest provider of cable based land systems worldwide  trailing only sercel 
in the cableless market  several companies have introduced technologies that compete  directly or indirectly  with firefly  including sercel  ascend geo  oyo geospace  fairfield  and wireless seismic 
each company is attempting to implement a cableless architecture in a slightly different way  with variations related to how the telemetry data communications backbone works  whether the system can use digital  full wave sensors or only analog geophones  and the amount of integration between the cableless recording unit and other technologies used for survey design  equipment deployment retrieval  operational command and control  and data management 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies 
although our portfolio of patents is considered important to our operations  no one patent is considered essential to our success 

table of contents our patents  copyrights  and trademarks offer us only limited protection 
our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  or may design around the proprietary features of our products 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs 
our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the united states 
from time to time  third parties inquire and claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights and we make similar inquiries and claims to third parties 
no material liabilities have resulted from these third party claims to date

regulatory matters our operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies  and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements could affect the demand for our products or result in the need to modify products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
our export activities are also subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations 
certain countries are subject to trade restrictions  embargoes  and sanctions imposed by the us government 
these restrictions and sanctions prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries 
our operations are subject to numerous local  state  and federal laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials  the remediation of contaminated properties  and the protection of the environment 
we do not currently foresee the need for significant expenditures to ensure our continued compliance with current environmental protection laws 
regulations in this area are subject to change  and there can be no assurance that future laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us 
our customers operations are also significantly impacted by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species 
for instance  many of our marine contractors have been affected by regulations protecting marine mammals in the gulf of mexico 
to the extent that our customers operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
employees as of december   we had  regular  full time employees  of which were located in the us from time to time and on an as needed basis  we supplement our regular workforce with individuals that we hire temporarily or as independent contractors in order to meet certain internal manufacturing or other business needs 
our us employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program  which included plans for reducing our headcount by approximately  or positions 
as of december   we had reduced our headcount by employees 
in the first quarter of  we completed our restructuring program  eliminating the remaining positions 
during  we will continue to evaluate our staffing needs and may further reduce our headcount

table of contents the adequacy of our future liquidity and capital resources  future oil and gas commodity prices  future opportunities for new products and projected research and development expenses  success in integrating our acquired businesses  expectations regarding realization of deferred tax assets  and anticipated results regarding accounting estimates we make 
these forward looking statements reflect our best judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us 
our results of operations can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we make or by risks and uncertainties known or unknown to us 
therefore  we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the forward looking statements 
actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations and assumptions 
while we cannot identify all of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from our expectations  we believe the following factors should be considered carefully the current economic and credit environment and lower oil and natural gas prices could have a continuing adverse affect on demand for certain of our products and services  our results of operations  our cash flows  our financial condition  our ability to borrow and our stock price 
commencing in late  global market and economic conditions became  and continue to be  disrupted and volatile 
concerns over energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to this increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated a global recession 
in the past  downturns in the us economy have caused weakened demand and lower prices for oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis  which have tended to reduce the levels of exploration for oil and natural gas 
historically  demand for our products and services has been sensitive to the level of exploration spending by e p companies and geophysical contractors  the demand for our products and services will be reduced if the level of exploration expenditures is reduced 
during periods of reduced levels of exploration for oil and natural gas  there have been oversupplies of seismic data and downward pricing pressures on our seismic products and services  which in turn  have limited our ability to meet sales objectives and maintain profit margins for our products and services 
in the past  these then prevailing industry conditions have had the effect of reducing our revenues and operating margins 
the markets for oil and gas historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future 
the recent turmoil in the credit markets and its potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings under either existing or new debt facilities in the public or private markets and on terms we believe to be reasonable 
continued weakness in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness in connection with the aram acquisition and to otherwise fund our operational requirements 
interest rates have fluctuated recently  have increased the costs of financing and will likely reduce our and our customers profits and expected returns on investment 
given the current credit environment  particularly the tightening of the credit markets  there can be no assurance that our customers will be able to borrow money on a timely basis or on reasonable terms  which could have a negative impact on their demand for our products and impair their ability to pay us for our products and services on a timely basis  or at all 
our sales are affected by interest rate fluctuations and the availability of liquidity  and we would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or liquidity constraints 
rising interest rates may also make certain alternative products and services provided by our competitors more attractive to customers  which could lead to a decline in demand for our products and services 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will persist  whether they will deteriorate further  and which of our products and services will be adversely affected 
we may have further impairment losses if events or changes in circumstances occur which reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying amount 
as a result  these conditions could adversely affect our 
table of contents financial condition and results of operations  and we may be subject to increased disputes and litigation because of these events and issues 
stock markets  in general  have experienced in recent months  and continue to experience  significant price and volume volatility  and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
this increased volatility  coupled with depressed economic conditions  could continue to have a depressing effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness  and we will need to pay or refinance our existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness  which may adversely affect our operations 
as a result of the aram acquisition  we have increased our indebtedness significantly 
as of december   we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million  including capital lease obligations 
total indebtedness on that date included million in borrowings under five year term indebtedness and million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility  in each case incurred under our amended commercial banking credit facility the amended credit facility 
we also had as of that date million of indebtedness outstanding under a bridge loan agreement  dated as of december   with jefferies finance llc jefferies as administrative agent  sole bookrunner  sole lead arranger and lender the bridge loan agreement  which indebtedness matures on january  in addition  we had million of subordinated indebtedness outstanding under an amended and restated subordinated promissory note the amended and restated subordinated note that we issued to one of aram s selling shareholders in exchange for a previous promissory note we had issued to that selling shareholder as part of the purchase price consideration for the acquisition of aram 
as of december   we had available million without giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit of additional revolving credit borrowing capacity under our amended credit facility 
however  as of february   we had available only million of additional revolving credit borrowing capacity  which can be used only to fund further letters of credit under the amended credit facility 
in january  standard and poor s rating services downgraded our outlook from stable to negative due to expectations of a weakening seismic market 
our substantial levels of indebtedness and our other financial obligations increase the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay  when due  the principal of  interest on or other amounts due  in respect of our outstanding indebtedness 
our substantial debt could also have other significant consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic  competitive and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes on satisfactory terms  or at all  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available to us for operations and any future business opportunities  expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings  including borrowings under our amended credit facility  are at variable rates of interest  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non strategic divestitures  limit our planning flexibility for  or ability to react to  changes in our business and the industries in which we operate  limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions  and place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors who may have less indebtedness or greater access to financing 
although we currently believe we will maintain compliance with our covenants throughout  there are certain scenarios where we could fall out of compliance with our financial covenants under our amended credit facility and our bridge loan agreement 

table of contents see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary our current debt levels and liquidity and capital resources sources of capital meeting our liquidity requirements 
if we fail to make any required payment under our amended credit facility  the bridge loan agreement or the amended and restated subordinated note  or if we fail to comply with any of the financial and operating covenants included in those debt instruments  we will be in default under their terms 
the lenders under such facilities could then accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and foreclose upon our and our subsidiaries assets that may secure such indebtedness 
other creditors might then accelerate other indebtedness under the cross default provisions in those agreements 
if our creditors accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness  we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our debt obligations 
our ability to obtain any financing  including any additional debt financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us or to negotiate extensions with our lenders on terms acceptable to us  it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
such defaults  if not rescinded or cured  would have a materially adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows 
to comply with our indebtedness and other obligations  we will require a significant amount of cash and will be required to satisfy certain debt financial covenants 
our ability to generate cash and satisfy debt covenants depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  including our acquisition debt  and to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the amended credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  including our acquisition debt  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  including our acquisition debt  on or before the maturity thereof 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  if for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service obligations  we would be in default under the terms of our agreements governing our outstanding debt 
if such a default were to occur  the lenders under the amended credit facility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility immediately due and payable  and the lenders would not be obligated to continue to advance funds to us 
in addition  if such a default were to occur  our other indebtedness would become immediately due and payable 
the amended credit facility and other outstanding debt instruments to which we are a party impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking other actions 
subject to certain exceptions and qualifications  the amended credit facility contains customary restrictions on our activities  including covenants that restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock  creating liens on our assets  making certain investments or restricted payments  consolidating or merging with  or acquiring  another business  selling or otherwise disposing of our assets  
table of contents paying dividends and making other distributions with respect to capital stock  or repurchasing  redeeming or retiring capital stock or subordinated debt  and entering into transactions with our affiliates 
the amended credit facility also contains covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and minimum thresholds 
for example  the amended credit facility requires that we and our domestic subsidiaries a maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in an amount equal to to for each fiscal quarter beginning in  b not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of to for each fiscal quarter beginning in  and c maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least of the our tangible net worth as of september  the date that we completed our acquisition of aram  plus of our consolidated net income for each quarter thereafter  and of the proceeds from any mandatorily convertible notes and preferred and common stock issuances for each quarter thereafter 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended credit facility 
we believe that  based on our operating plan and results to date in fiscal  we will remain in compliance with the financial covenants during as with any operating plan  however  there are risks associated with our ability to execute our plan 
in addition  our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control  including further declines in e p company and seismic contractor spending  significant write downs of accounts receivable  changes in certain exchange rates and other factors 
our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and debt service capability 
if we were not able to satisfy all of the financial covenants  we would need to seek to amend  or seek one or more waivers of  the covenants under the amended credit facility 
if we cannot satisfy the financial covenants and are unable to obtain waivers or amendments  the lenders could declare a default under the amended credit facility 
any default under our amended credit facility would allow the lenders under the facility the option to demand repayment of the indebtedness outstanding under the facility  and would allow certain other lenders to exercise their rights and remedies under cross default provisions 
if these lenders were to exercise their rights to accelerate the indebtedness outstanding  there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance or otherwise repay any amounts that may become accelerated under the agreements 
the acceleration of a significant portion of our indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  and financial condition 
the bridge loan agreement contains terms that incorporate many of the same covenants from the amended credit facility 
in addition  the amended and restated subordinated note contains additional restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt 
any additional debt financing we obtain is likely to have similarly restrictive covenants 
the restrictions in the amended credit facility and our other debt instruments may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business  and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted 
we also may incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility 
we cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements  or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the breach of any of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default under the amended credit facility and our other debt instruments 
an event of default under our debt agreements would permit the holders of such indebtedness to declare all amounts borrowed to be due and payable 
given the reduced budgets for capital expenditures by e p companies  demand for our products and services and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
demand for our services depends upon the level of spending by e p companies and seismic contractors for exploration and development activities  and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices 
spending on products and services such as those we provide our customers are of a highly discretionary nature and subject to rapid and material change 
any significant decline in oil and gas related spending on behalf of our customers could cause alterations in our capital spending plans  project modifications  delays or cancellations  general business disruptions or delays in payment  or non payment of amounts that are owed to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to continue to satisfy all of the covenants in our loan agreements 
additionally  increases in oil and gas prices may not increase demand for our services or otherwise have a positive effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
oil and gas companies willingness to explore  develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control  such as the supply of and demand for oil and gas  
table of contents the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and gas  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels for oil  the expected rates of declining current production  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves  weather conditions  including hurricanes  that can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area  as well as less severe inclement weather that can preclude or delay seismic data acquisition  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil and gas producing countries  technical advances affecting energy consumption  government policies regarding the exploration  production and development of oil and gas reserves  the ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing  and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas companies and seismic contractors 
the level of oil and gas exploration and production activity has been volatile in recent years 
previously forecasted trends in oil and gas exploration and development activities may not continue and demand for our products and services may not reflect the level of activity in the industry 
any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and gas prices would likely affect oil and gas production levels and therefore adversely affect demand for the products and services we provide 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenues from foreign operations and sales  which pose additional risks 
sales to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december   and we believe that export sales will remain a significant percentage of our revenue 
us export restrictions affect the types and specifications of products we can export 
additionally  to complete certain sales  us laws may require us to obtain export licenses  and we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty in obtaining these licenses 
like many energy service companies  we have operations in and sales into certain international areas  including parts of the middle east  west africa  latin america  asia pacific and the commonwealth of independent states  that are subject to risks of war  political disruption  civil disturbance  political corruption  possible economic and legal sanctions such as possible restrictions against countries that the us government may deem to sponsor terrorism and changes in global trade policies 
our sales or operations may become restricted or prohibited in any country in which the foregoing risks occur 
in particular  the occurrence of any of these risks could result in the following events  which in turn  could materially and adversely impact our results of operations disruption of oil and natural gas e p activities  restriction of the movement and exchange of funds  inhibition of our ability to collect receivables  enactment of additional or stricter us government or international sanctions  limitation of our access to markets for periods of time  expropriation and nationalization of our assets  
table of contents political and economic instability  which may include armed conflict and civil disturbance  currency fluctuations  devaluations  and conversion restrictions  confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies  and governmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights 
our international operations and sales increase our exposure to other countries restrictive tariff regulations  other import export restrictions and customer credit risk 
in addition  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide 
our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities  and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes  penalties and or interest 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
each borrowing under our amended credit facility will bear interest  at our option  at either an alternate base rate or a libor based rate 
as of december   the million in term loan indebtedness under the amended credit facility accrued interest using the libor based interest rate of per annum  while million in total revolving credit indebtedness under the amended credit facility accrued interest using the alternate base rate of per annum 
the average effective interest rate for the quarter ended december  under the libor based and alternate based rates was assuming that no revolving indebtedness is repaid and that million in revolving loans are outstanding  a increase in the floating interest rate on the outstanding principal amount of the term loan indebtedness would result in increased interest expense of million per year 
assuming that no term loan indebtedness is repaid and that million in loans are outstanding  a increase in the floating interest rate on the outstanding principal amount of the term loan indebtedness would result in increased interest expense of million per year 
outstanding borrowings under our bridge loan agreement will bear interest at either the one month libor rate plus per annum or the alternate base rate plus  if the libor based rate cannot be determined 
the interest rates shall not be less than per annum nor greater than per annum 
additionally  we have agreed to pay the lender a non refundable initial duration fee of of the aggregate principal amount of the bridge loans outstanding if any on june  and a non refundable additional duration fee of of the aggregate principal amount of the bridge loans outstanding if any on september  inclusive of these additional fees and an upfront fee previously paid  the effective interest rate was as of december  assuming that no indebtedness under the bridge loan agreement is repaid  a increase in the effective floating interest rate on the outstanding principal amount would result in increased interest expense of million per year 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding indebtedness of million was 
due to the international scope of our business activities  our results of operations may be significantly affected by currency fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues from international sales  subjecting us to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 
through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including the united kingdom  canada  the netherlands  china  venezuela  india  russia  the united arab emirates and other countries 
certain of these countries have experienced economic problems and uncertainties from time to time 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world  or the collectibility of receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we currently require customers in certain higher risk countries to provide their own financing 
in some cases  we have assisted our customers in organizing international financing and export import credit guarantees provided by the united states government 
we do not currently extend long term credit through notes to companies in countries we consider to be too risky from a credit risk perspective 

table of contents a majority of our foreign net working capital is within the united kingdom and canada 
the subsidiaries in those countries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in pounds sterling gbp and canadian dollars cad  respectively 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in gbp or cad  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
for financial reporting purposes  such depreciation will negatively affect our reported results of operations since gbp and cad denominated earnings that are converted to us dollars are stated at a decreased value 
in addition  since we participate in competitive bids for sales of certain of our products and services that are denominated in us dollars  a depreciation of the us dollar against the gbp and cad harms our competitive position against companies whose financial strength bears less correlation to the strength of the us dollar 
while we have employed economic cash flow and fair value hedges designed to minimize the risks associated with these exchange rate fluctuations  the hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that fluctuations in the values of the currencies of countries in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations 
we may not gain rapid market acceptance for our full wave digital products  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have spent considerable time and capital developing our full wave equipment product lines that incorporate our vectorseis  firefly  scorpion  and associated technologies 
because these products rely on a new digital sensor  our ability to sell these products will depend on acceptance of our digital sensor and technology solutions by geophysical contractors and e p companies 
if our customers do not believe that our digital sensor delivers higher quality data with greater operational efficiency  our results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
the introduction of new seismic technologies and products has traditionally involved long development cycles 
because our full wave digital products incorporate new technologies  we have experienced slow market acceptance and market penetration for these products 
for these reasons  we have continued to be unable to foresee and accurately predict future sales volumes  revenues  and margins for these new products from period to period with the certainty we have desired 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period  and we are subject to seasonality factors 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations from period to period as a result of new product or service introductions  the timing of significant expenses in connection with customer orders  unrealized sales  levels of research and development activities in different periods  the product mix sold  and the seasonality of our business 
because many of our products feature a high sales price and are technologically complex  we generally have experienced long sales cycles for these products and historically incur significant expense at the beginning of these cycles for component parts and other inventory necessary to manufacture a product in anticipation of a future sale  which may not ultimately occur 
in addition  the revenues from our sales can vary widely from period to period due to changes in customer requirements 
these factors can create fluctuations in our net revenues and results of operations from period to period 
variability in our overall gross margins for any period  which depend on the percentages of higher margin and lower margin products and services sold in that period  compounds these uncertainties 
as a result  if net revenues or gross margins fall below expectations  our results of operations and financial condition will likely be adversely affected 
additionally  our business can be seasonal in nature  with strongest demand typically in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 
due to the relatively high sales price of many of our products and seismic data libraries and relatively low unit sales volume  our quarterly operating results have historically fluctuated from period to period due to the timing of orders and shipments and the mix of products and services sold 
this uneven pattern makes financial predictions for any given period difficult  increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition  and places challenges on our inventory management 
delays caused by factors beyond our control  such as the granting of permits for seismic surveys by third parties and the availability and equipping of marine vessels  can affect our ion solutions division s revenues from its processing and iss services from period to period 
also  delays in ordering products or in shipping or delivering products in a given period could significantly affect our results of operations for that period 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause greater volatility in the market price of our common stock 
our outstanding shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock  series d cumulative convertible preferred stock and series d cumulative convertible preferred stock are convertible into shares of our common stock 
the conversion of these securities would result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders  and sales in the open market of the shares of common stock acquired upon conversion may have the effect of reducing the then current market prices for our common stock 

table of contents the conversion of our outstanding shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock  series d cumulative convertible preferred stock and series d cumulative convertible preferred stock together  the series d preferred stock into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion would likely apply downward pressure on prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the very existence of the outstanding shares of the series d preferred stock represents potential issuances of common stock upon their conversion  and could represent potential sales into the market of our common stock to be acquired on conversion  which could also depress trading prices for our common stock 
technologies and businesses that we acquire including those in connection with the aram acquisition may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
our acquisition of aram is part of our current business strategy  which is to seek new technologies  products and businesses to broaden the scope of our existing and planned product lines and technologies 
this acquisition involves the integration of two companies that previously have operated independently  which is a complex and time consuming process 
while we believe that the aram acquisition will complement our technologies and our general business strategy  there can be no assurance that we will achieve the expected benefit of the acquisition 
this and future acquisitions may result in unexpected costs  expenses  and liabilities  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the aram acquisition and future acquisitions expose us to increased costs associated with the acquisition and operation of the new businesses or technologies and the management of geographically dispersed operations  risks associated with the assimilation of new technologies including incorporating aram s land seismic acquisition products with our existing product lines  operations  sites  and personnel  difficulties in retaining and integrating key technical  sales and marketing personnel and the possible loss of such employees and costs associated with their loss  difficulties associated with preserving relationships with aram s customers  partners and vendors  risks that any technology we acquire may not perform as well as we had anticipated  the diversion of management s attention and other resources from existing business concerns  the potential inability to replicate operating efficiencies in the acquired company s operations  potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets  the inability to generate revenues to offset associated acquisition costs  the requirement to maintain uniform standards  controls and procedures  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new and inexperienced management personnel  and the risk that acquired technologies do not provide us with the benefits we anticipated 
integration of the acquired businesses requires significant efforts from each entity  including coordinating existing business plans and research and development efforts 
we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies  cost savings or other benefits that we expect from the acquisition 
the process of combining an acquired business with our business could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined company s business and the loss of key personnel and distract management s attention from the day to day operation of the combined companies 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses  our future results will be negatively impacted 

table of contents aram s land data acquisition systems have been a direct competitor of our scorpion land acquisition systems and their predecessors in recent years 
the integration of the scorpion and the aram land acquisition system product lines may prove to be difficult  involving issues concerning marketing strategies  product roadmaps  preservation of the existing bases of installed products and coordination of the different development and engineering teams 
no prediction can be made as to the degree of success if any we may experience in the timely integration of these product lines 
in addition  while the aram acquisition is consistent with our strategy to increase our market share in cable based land acquisition systems  the acquisition will present challenges for us in terms of a modified roadmap for the further development of our scorpion land acquisition system 
goodwill and other intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions are subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result  we could be required to write off additional goodwill and other intangible assets  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we are required to compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting units is less than its carrying value 
at december   we evaluated our reporting units for potential impairment 
based upon our evaluation and given the current market conditions  we determined that approximately million of goodwill related to our land imaging systems including aram and ion solutions reporting units was impaired 
we recorded the expense as of december  and reduced the carrying amount of our goodwill 
any further reduction in or impairment of the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets will result in additional charges against our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods 
we are exposed to risks related to complex  highly technical products 
our customers often require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
because many of our products are complex and often use unique advanced components  processes  technologies  and techniques  undetected errors and design and manufacturing flaws may occur 
even though we attempt to assure that our systems are always reliable in the field  the many technical variables related to their operations can cause a combination of factors that can  and have from time to time  caused performance and service issues with certain of our products 
product defects result in higher product service  warranty  and replacement costs and may affect our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which may adversely impact our results of operations 
despite our testing and quality assurance programs  undetected errors may not be discovered until the product is purchased and used by a customer in a variety of field conditions 
if our customers deploy our new products and they do not work correctly  our relationship with our customers may be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of our systems advanced and complex nature  we expect to experience occasional operational issues from time to time 
generally  until our products have been tested in the field under a wide variety of operational conditions  we cannot be certain that performance and service problems will not arise 
in that case  market acceptance of our new products could be delayed and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
reservoir exploration technology rxt has been a significant customer of our marine imaging systems segment 
a loss of business from this customer could adversely affect our sales and financial condition if rxt is not replaced by another customer or customers 
in may  we entered into a multi year agreement with rxt under which they agreed to purchase a minimum of million in vectorseis ocean vso systems and related equipment through in addition  this agreement entitles us to receive a royalty of of revenues generated by rxt through the use of all vso equipment commencing in january until the expiration of the agreement 
in turn  rxt has been granted exclusive rights to this product line through for the year ended december  and  million  or  and million  or  respectively  of our consolidated net revenues  were attributable to marine equipment sales to rxt 
the loss of rxt as a customer or a significant reduction in their equipment or systems needs could reduce our sales volumes and revenues and lessen our cash flows  and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
unless we can broaden our customer base for these marine products  we can give no assurances that the revenues and cash flows from rxt  if lost  can be replaced 
to the extent that the 
table of contents risks faced by rxt cause it to curtail its business activities or to make timely payments to its suppliers  we are subject to the same risks 
we rely on highly skilled personnel in our businesses  and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel  we may not be able to grow effectively 
our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate  and retain skilled personnel for all areas of our organization 
we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our businesses 
competition for qualified personnel required for our data processing operations and our other segments businesses has intensified in recent years 
our growth has presented challenges to us to recruit  train  and retain our employees while managing the impact of potential wage inflation and the lack of available qualified labor in some markets where we operate 
a well trained  motivated and adequately staffed work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business 
our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees 
if we do not effectively manage our transitions into new products and services  our revenues may suffer 
products and services for the seismic industry are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance  software functionality and features  frequent introduction of new products and services  and improvement in price characteristics relative to product and service performance 
among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing  variations in costs  delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions  write offs or write downs of the carrying costs of inventory and raw materials associated with prior generation products  difficulty in predicting customer demand for new product and service offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand  risks associated with customer qualification  evaluation of new products  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software 
the introduction of new products and services by our competitors also may result in delays in customer purchases and difficulty in predicting customer demand 
if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings  our revenues and margins may decline 
furthermore  sales of our new products and services may replace sales  or result in discounting of some of our current offerings  offsetting the benefit of a successful introduction 
in addition  it may be difficult to ensure performance of new products and services in accordance with our revenue  margin  and cost estimates and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates 
given the competitive nature of the seismic industry  if any of these risks materializes  future demand for our products and services  and our future results of operations  may suffer 
technological change in the seismic industry requires us to make substantial research and development expenditures 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by changing technology and new product introductions 
we must invest substantial capital to develop and maintain a leading edge in technology  with no assurance that we will receive an adequate rate of return on those investments 
if we are unable to develop and produce successfully and timely new and enhanced products and services  we will be unable to compete in the future and our business  our results of operations and our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we invest significant sums of money in acquiring and processing seismic data for our ion solutions multi client data library 
we invest significant amounts in acquiring and processing new seismic data to add to our ion solutions multi client data library 
a majority of these investments is funded by our customers  while the remainder is recovered through future data licensing fees 
in  we invested million in our multi client data library 
our customers generally commit to licensing the data prior to our initiating a new data library acquisition program 
however  the aggregate amounts of future licensing fees for this data are sometimes uncertain and depend on a variety of factors  including the market prices of oil and gas  customer demand for seismic data in the library  and the availability of similar data from competitors 
for example  the rapid decline of oil and natural gas prices in late could cause e p companies to significantly delay or reduce their current seismic capital spending budgets 
therefore  we may not be able to recover all of the costs of or earn any return on these investments 
in periods in which sales do not meet original expectations  we may be required to record additional amortization and or impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our data library  which charges may be material to our results of operations in any period 

table of contents the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have traditionally relied on a relatively small number of significant customers 
consequently  our business is exposed to the risks related to customer concentration 
no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  however  our top five customers in total represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net revenues during those years 
the loss of any of our significant customers or deterioration in our relations with any of them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  a relatively small number of customers has accounted for the majority of our net revenues in any period 
during the last ten years  our traditional seismic contractor customers have been rapidly consolidating  thereby consolidating the demand for our products 
the loss of any of our significant customers to further consolidation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our ion solutions and data management solutions segments increase our exposure to the risks experienced by more technology intensive companies 
the businesses of ion solutions and data management solutions  being more concentrated in software  processing services  and proprietary technologies than our traditional business  have exposed us to the risks typically encountered by smaller technology companies that are more dependent on proprietary technology protection 
these risks include future competition from more established companies entering the market  product obsolescence  dependence upon continued growth of the market for seismic data processing  the rate of change in the markets for these segments technology and services  research and development efforts not proving sufficient to keep up with changing market demands  dependence on third party software for inclusion in these segments products and services  misappropriation of these segments technology by other companies  alleged or actual infringement of intellectual property rights that could result in substantial additional costs  difficulties inherent in forecasting sales for newly developed technologies or advancements in technologies  recruiting  training  and retaining technically skilled personnel that could increase the costs for these segments  or limit their growth  and the ability to maintain traditional margins for certain of their technology or services 
we are subject to intense competition  which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or to maintain our prices at profitable levels 
many of our sales are obtained through a competitive bidding process  which is standard for our industry 
competitive factors in recent years have included price  technological expertise  and a reputation for quality  safety and dependability 
while no single company competes with us in all of our segments  we are subject to intense competition in each of our segments 
new entrants in many of the markets in which certain of our products and services are currently strong should be expected 
see item business competition 
we compete with companies that are larger than we are in terms of revenues  number of processing locations and sales and marketing resources 
a few of our competitors have a competitive advantage in being part of an affiliated seismic contractor company 
in addition  we compete with major service providers and government sponsored enterprises and affiliates 
some of our competitors conduct seismic data acquisition operations as part of their regular business  which we do not  and have greater financial and other resources than we do 
these and other competitors may be better positioned to withstand and adjust more quickly to volatile market conditions  such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices  as well as changes in government regulations 
in addition  any excess supply of products and services in the seismic services market could apply downward pressure on prices for our products and 
table of contents services 
the negative effects of the competitive environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
certain of our facilities could be damaged by hurricanes and other natural disasters  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
certain of our facilities are located in regions of the united states that are susceptible to damage from hurricanes and other weather events  and  during  were impacted by hurricanes or weather events 
our marine imaging systems segment leases  square feet of facilities located in harahan  louisiana  in the greater new orleans metropolitan area 
in late august  we suspended operations at this facility and evacuated and locked down the facility in preparation for hurricane katrina 
this facility did not experience flooding or significant damage during or after the hurricane 
however  because of employee evacuations  power failures and lack of related support services  utilities and infrastructure in the new orleans area  we were unable to resume full operations at the facility until late september in september  we lost power and related services for several days at our offices located in the houston metropolitan area and in harahan  louisiana as a result of hurricane ike and hurricane gustav 
future hurricanes or similar natural disasters that impact our facilities may negatively affect our financial position and operating results for those periods 
these negative effects may include reduced production and product sales  costs associated with resuming production  reduced orders for our products from customers that were similarly affected by these events  lost market share  late deliveries  additional costs to purchase materials and supplies from outside suppliers  uninsured property losses  inadequate business interruption insurance and an inability to retain necessary staff 
we have outsourcing arrangements with third parties to manufacture some of our products 
if these third party suppliers fail to deliver quality products or components at reasonable prices on a timely basis  we may alienate some of our customers and our revenues  profitability  and cash flow may decline 
additionally  the current global economic crisis could have a negative impact on our suppliers  causing a disruption in our vendor supplies 
a disruption in vendor supplies may adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturing processes require a high volume of quality components 
we have increased our use of contract manufacturers as an alternative to our own manufacturing of products 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of our vibrator vehicles  our towed marine streamers  our redeployable ocean bottom cables  our applied mems components  various components of vectorseis ocean  and certain electronic and ground components of our land acquisition systems 
certain components used by us are currently provided by only one supplier 
if  in implementing any outsource initiative  we are unable to identify contract manufacturers willing to contract with us on competitive terms and to devote adequate resources to fulfill their obligations to us or if we do not properly manage these relationships  our existing customer relationships may suffer 
in addition  by undertaking these activities  we run the risk that the reputation and competitiveness of our products and services may deteriorate as a result of the reduction of our control over quality and delivery schedules 
we also may experience supply interruptions  cost escalations  and competitive disadvantages if our contract manufacturers fail to develop  implement  or maintain manufacturing methods appropriate for our products and customers 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involves several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key components  increases in component costs and reduced control over delivery schedules 
if any of these risks are realized  our revenues  profitability  and cash flows may decline 
in addition  as we come to rely more heavily on contract manufacturers  we may have fewer personnel resources with expertise to manage problems that may arise from these third party arrangements 
additionally  our suppliers could be negatively impacted by current global economic conditions 
if certain of our suppliers were to experience significant cash flow issues or become insolvent as a result of such conditions  it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies to us or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 
our outsourcing relationships may require us to purchase inventory when demand for products produced by third party manufacturers is low 
under some of our outsourcing arrangements  our manufacturing outsourcers purchase agreed upon inventory levels to meet our forecasted demand 
our manufacturing plans and inventory levels are generally based on sales forecasts 
if demand proves to be less than we originally forecasted and we cancel our committed purchase orders  our outsourcers generally will have the right to require us to purchase inventory which they had purchased on our behalf 
should we be required to purchase inventory under these terms  we may be required to hold inventory that we may never utilize 

table of contents under our five year supply agreement with colibrys ltd  we have committed to purchase a minimum number of mems accelerometers with an agreed upon cost of between million to million per year through if demand for our vectorseis products  of which mems accelerometers are a component  proves to be less than we originally forecasted  we could be required to purchase mems accelerometers that we may never utilize 
we may be unable to obtain broad intellectual property protection for our current and future products and we may become involved in intellectual property disputes 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies 
we believe that the technological and creative skill of our employees  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition  and reliable product maintenance are the foundations of our competitive advantage 
although we have a considerable portfolio of patents  copyrights  and trademarks  these property rights offer us only limited protection 
our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  or may design around the proprietary features of our products 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs 
our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the united states 
third parties inquire and claim from time to time that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  result in injunctions  require product modifications  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such claims could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations  and the operations of our customers  are subject to numerous government regulations  which could adversely limit our operating flexibility 
our operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies  and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements could affect the demand for our products or result in the need to modify products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
our export activities are also subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations 
certain countries are subject to restrictions  sanctions  and embargoes imposed by the united states government 
these restrictions  sanctions  and embargoes also prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries 
our operations are subject to numerous local  state  and federal laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials  the remediation of contaminated properties  and the protection of the environment 
these laws have been changed frequently in the past  and there can be no assurance that future changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our customers operations are also significantly impacted by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species 
consequently  changes in governmental regulations applicable to our customers may reduce demand for our products 
for instance  regulations regarding the protection of marine mammals in the gulf of mexico may reduce demand for our air guns and other marine products 
to the extent that our customers operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
if we  our option holders or our existing stockholders holding registration rights sell additional shares of our common stock in the future  the market price of our common stock could decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market in the future  or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales and the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at prices that we deem appropriate 
at december   we had outstanding stock options to purchase up to  shares of our common stock

any sales of our common stock under these registration rights arrangements with laitram or other stockholders could be negatively perceived in the trading markets and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market under these arrangements  or the expectation of such sales  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  delaware law  our stockholders rights plan  the terms of our series d preferred stock and contractual requirements under our agreement with fletcher contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us

ion solutions advanced seismic data processing services for marine and land environments  seismic data libraries  and integrated seismic solutions iss services 
our current business strategy is predicated on successfully executing seven key imperatives 
table of contents continuing to manage our cost structure to reflect current market and economic conditions while keeping key strategic technology programs progressing with an overall goal of enabling e p companies to solve their complex reservoir problems most efficiently and effectively  expanding our ion solutions business in new regions with new customers and new land and marine service offerings  including proprietary services for owners and operators of oil and gas properties  globalizing our ion solutions data processing business by opening advanced imaging centers in new strategic locations  and expanding our presence in the land seismic processing segment  with emphasis on serving the emerging national oil companies  developing and introducing our next generation of marine towed streamer products  with a goal of developing markets beyond the new vessel market  expanding our seabed imaging solutions business using our vectorseis ocean vso acquisition system platform and derivative products to obtain technical and market leadership in what we continue to believe is a very important and expanding market  utilizing our recent aram acquisition as a framework to increase our market share and profitability in cable based land acquisition systems  and furthering the commercialization of firefly  our cableless full wave land data acquisition system  through sales and also through a services rental model to advance the diffusion rate 
our current debt levels 
as a result of the aram acquisition  we have increased our indebtedness significantly 
as of december   we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million  including capital lease obligations 
total indebtedness on that date included million in borrowings under five year term indebtedness and million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility  in each case incurred under our amended commercial banking credit facility the amended credit facility 
we also had as of that date million of indebtedness outstanding under a bridge loan agreement  dated as of december   with jefferies finance llc jefferies as administrative agent  sole bookrunner  sole lead arranger and lender the bridge loan agreement  which indebtedness matures on january  in addition  we had million of subordinated indebtedness outstanding under an amended and restated subordinated promissory note the amended and restated subordinated note that we issued to one of aram s selling shareholders in exchange for a previous promissory note we had issued to that selling shareholder as part of the purchase price consideration for the acquisition of aram 
as of december   we had available million without giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit of additional revolving credit borrowing capacity under our amended credit facility 
however  as of february   we had available only million of additional revolving credit borrowing capacity  which can be used only to fund further letters of credit under the amended credit facility 
our cash and cash equivalents as of february  were approximately million compared to million at december  we intend to pay or refinance the indebtedness that we borrowed to complete the aram acquisition  which includes the bridge loan agreement scheduled to mature on january  and the amended and restated subordinated seller note scheduled to mature on september  see further discussion at note notes payable  long term debt and lease obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and are continuing to explore methods to accomplish this 
our ability to obtain any refinancing  including any additional debt financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a timeframe acceptable to us and we are unable to pay the debts as they become due  we could be in default under our debt instruments and agreements  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
any such defaults  if not rescinded or cured  would have a materially adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and cash flows 
see liquidity and capital resources sources of capital below and item a risk factors above 
in january  standard and poor s rating services downgraded our outlook from stable to negative due to expectations of a weakening seismic market 

table of contents at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended credit facility and the bridge loan agreement 
we believe that  based on our operating plan  we will remain in compliance with the financial covenants during as discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k  however  there are scenarios under which we could fall out of compliance with the financial covenants contained in the amended credit facility and the bridge loan agreement 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and debt service capability 
if we were not able to satisfy all of the financial covenants  we would need to seek to amend  or seek one or more waivers of  the covenants under the amended credit facility and the bridge loan agreement 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such waivers or amendments  in which case we would likely seek to obtain new secured debt  unsecured debt or equity financing 
however  there also can be no assurance that such debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in the event that we would need to amend the amended credit facility and the bridge loan agreement  or obtain new financing  we would likely incur substantial up front fees and higher interest costs  and other terms in the amendment would likely be less favorable than those currently in the amended credit facility or the bridge loan agreement 
economic and credit market conditions 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness to expend their capital for oil and natural gas exploration and development projects 
this demand is highly sensitive to current and expected future oil and natural gas prices 
the current global financial crisis  which has contributed  among other things  to significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit  has resulted in the worldwide economy entering into a recessionary period  which may be prolonged and severe 
during  oil prices were highly volatile  increasing to record levels in the second quarter of and then sharply declining thereafter 
falling crude oil prices have prompted the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to announce reductions in oil production quotas 
us inventory levels for natural gas rose higher than expected during  and north american natural gas prices nymex have fallen from the per mcf level during the summer of to below per mcf 
the uncertainty surrounding future economic activity levels and the tightening of credit availability has resulted in decreased activity levels for most of our businesses 
our land seismic businesses in north america and russia have been particularly adversely affected 
we expect that exploration and production expenditures will be constrained to the extent e p companies and seismic contractors are limited in their access to the credit markets as a result of further disruptions in  or a more conservative lending practices in  the credit markets 
there is significant uncertainty about future activity levels and the impact on our businesses 
we believe that we are in a down cycle for our products and services that will likely last for at least one year  with an expected recovery starting sometime in  depending on the depth and length of the current downturn 
furthermore  we understand that both our seismic contractor customers and the e p companies that are users of our products  services and technology have reduced their capital spending 
while the current global recession and the decline in oil and gas prices have slowed demand in the near term  we believe that overcoming the long term decline rates in oil and gas production  compared to the discoveries of new oil and gas reserves  will prove to be difficult 
we believe that technology that adds a competitive advantage through cost reductions or improvements in productivity will continue to be valued in our marketplace  even in for example  we believe that our new technologies  such as firefly  digifin and orca  will continue to attract interest because they are designed to deliver improvements in image quality and more productive delivery systems 
we are re assigning much of our sales efforts for our aries land seismic systems from north america to international sales channels other than russia 
in late  we announced the commercialization of our aries ii system  which we believe will provide more flexibility for users 
while it is difficult to determine the length and severity of the downturn  we believe the long term prospects for the exploration and production industry and our company are still fundamentally positive 
international oil companies ioc s continue to have difficulty accessing new sources of supply  partially as a result of the growth of national oil companies 
this situation is also affected by increasing environmental issues  particularly in north america  where companies may be temporarily or permanently denied access to some of the most promising exploration opportunities both onshore and offshore 
it is estimated that approximately of the world s reserves are controlled by national oil companies  which increasingly prefer to develop resources on their own or by working directly with the oil field services and equipment providers 
these dynamics often prevent capital  technology and project management capabilities from being optimally deployed on the best exploration and production opportunities  which results in global supply capacity being less than it otherwise might be 
as a consequence  the pace of new supply additions may be insufficient to keep up with demand once the global recession ends 

table of contents in response to this downturn  we have taken measures to further reduce costs in our businesses  and particularly in our land seismic business in connection with our integration of aram into our legacy land product lines 
we expect that will prove to be a challenging year for our north america and russia land systems and vibroseis truck sales 
in addition  we slowed our capital spending  including investments for our multi client data library  during the fourth quarter of and are projecting capital expenditures for at million to million compared with million for of that total  we expect to spend approximately million to million on investments in our multi client data library during  and we anticipate that a majority of this investment will be underwritten by our customers 
to the extent our customers commitments do not reach an acceptable level of pre funding  the amount of our anticipated investment could significantly decline 
the remaining sums are anticipated to be funded from internally generated cash 
through a variety of other resources  we are exploring ways to reduce our cost structure 
we have taken a deliberate approach to identifying the weaknesses in our business and  in light of the tight credit markets  plan to take a more conservative approach in making extended financing terms available to our customers 
the most significant cost reduction to date related to a headcount reduction in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of to adjust to the expected lower levels of activity  resulting in an expected savings of million per year 
we plan to reduce our research and development spending but will continue to fund strategic programs to position ourselves for the expected rebound in economic activity 
overall  we will give priority to generating cash flow and taking steps to reduce our cost structure while maintaining our long term commitment to continued technology development 
developments 
the year was a year of contrasts for the oil and gas industry as a whole and for our company 
in july  oil prices reached an all time high of nearly per barrel 
market conditions changed dramatically commencing in september as disruption in the us financial markets prompted a global economic crisis  resulting in a dramatic decrease in demand for a wide variety of products and services throughout the world  including the demand for oil and natural gas 
by the end of  oil prices had fallen to approximately per barrel and continued at such low prices into the sharp decline in commodity prices  combined with a severe credit shortfall and increasing costs of credit  resulted in e p companies decreasing  and in some cases halting  their e p capital and expenditure plans 
since  we have grown at a rapid pace  and through the beginning of the fourth quarter of  were poised to continue that success 
in late  however  economic conditions began to have a material impact on our industry and the demand for our products  particularly in our land imaging systems segment 
in our land imaging systems segment  revenues for the fiscal year declined by compared to this segment s revenues for the same period in this decrease was principally due to the decline in business activity during the fourth quarter of resulting from the decline of the global economy  coupled with the fact that significant revenue events that occurred during were not duplicated in  including i the shipment of land seismic acquisition systems ordered by oil and natural gas corporation limited ongc  the indian national oil company  and ii the sale of the initial firefly system 
during the fiscal year  our marine imaging systems and ion solutions segments experienced significant percentage increases in revenues compared to their revenues for the fiscal year ended december  our data management solutions segment s revenues remained relatively stable with a million decline compared to the prior year 
our overall total net revenues of million for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  compared to total net revenues for our overall gross margin percentage for the twelve months of improved to compared to for however  the economic developments in the fourth quarter of resulted in significantly lower revenues during what has historically been our strongest quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a loss from operations of million compared to million income from operations for fiscal  mainly due to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of million 
developments during and early include the following on september   we acquired aram 
see further discussion below at aram acquisition of this item in march  we completed acquisition of a basin scale seismic survey library that provides a new regional d seismic framework of the eastern java sea and the makassar straits  two prospective areas offshore indonesia and malaysia 
data for nearly  kilometers were acquired during the acquisition phase of this project 
we experienced strong sales of our new digifin advanced streamer command and control systems as market demand continued to be strong for this new product 
in june  our first digistreamer solid streamer acquisition system was successfully deployed in a commercial acquisition program in the north sea 

table of contents on july   we entered into a million amended and restated revolving credit facility 
in september and december  we amended this facility to add a new million term loan sub facility to finance our acquisition of aram  to permit us to implement a shareholder rights plan and to accommodate the terms of our refinancing transactions on december  see liquidity and capital resources sources of capital revolving line of credit and term facilities below 
in august  we successfully completed the acquisition phase of a multi client seismic imaging project using our firefly cableless land acquisition system at durham ranch in northwest colorado 
more than  vectorseis enabled firefly stations were deployed with  receiver points of full wave seismic data acquired 
in october  we announced that we had been awarded a multi year  marine multi component processing contract by mobil producing nigeria mpn unlimited  operator of a joint venture with nigeria national petroleum corporation 
the contract was the largest data processing project in our history and consisted of providing advanced imaging services for a series of seabed seismic surveys to be acquired over the next several years 
in november  we announced the completion of our basin scale arcticspan 
this new data complements the original  kilometers of arcticspan data acquired during in total  more than  km of ultra deep  basin scale d data  imaged with advanced processing and depth imaging techniques from our ion solutions segment  are currently available 
in november  after successful field trials with conquest seismic services  inc in north dakota  we announced the commercialization of our cable based aries ii seismic recording platform 
aries ii builds upon the market success of aries i  but implements a new system architecture that is designed to improve channel capacity  efficient equipment deployment and system performance 
in november  we were awarded a fleet wide contract in excess of million by the polarcus group of companies to equip their vessels with four streamer positioning and control technologies 
these technologies include digifin  compassbird  digirange ii and orca command and control systems 
in january  we announced our first commercial delivery of a multi thousand station firefly system equipped with digital  full wave vectorseis sensors 
the deployment of ion s first commercialized firefly system is taking place in a producing hydrocarbon basin containing reservoirs that have proven difficult to image with conventional seismic techniques

aram acquisition in july  we signed a purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of aram systems ltd  a canadian based provider of cable based land seismic recording systems  and its affiliated company  canadian seismic rentals inc sometimes collectively referred to herein as aram  from their shareholders the sellers 
founded in  aram designs  manufactures  sells and leases land seismic data acquisition systems  specializing in analog cabled systems 
over the last several years  we believe that aram has demonstrated an ability to gain presence in an expanding global market for cable based land seismic recording systems 
aram s aries recording systems  known for reliability and ease of use  have been increasingly used by north american contractors 
we believe the scope and scale of the combined entity will offer our customers expanded and accelerated access to a broader range of instrumentation options and enable our consolidated land business to grow and deliver bottom line results more effectively than either company could on its own 
in addition to synergies associated with the consolidation of products and technical and operations personnel  we believe we have an opportunity to leverage each other s customer base as well as incorporating aram s ability to design and manufacture high margin land imaging systems within ion 
on september   we  aram and the sellers entered into an amended and restated share purchase agreement the amended purchase agreement  that amended the terms of the original share purchase agreement executed in july on september   we  through our acquisition subsidiary  nova scotia company ion sub see note aram acquisition of the notes to consolidated financial statements  completed the acquisition of the outstanding shares of aram in accordance with the terms of the amended purchase agreement 
in exchange for the shares of aram  we  through ion sub  i paid the sellers aggregate cash consideration of million which amount was net of certain purchase price adjustments made at the closing  ii issued to one of the sellers  shares of our common stock and iii issued to one of the sellers an unsecured senior promissory note in the original principal amount of million the senior seller note and an unsecured subordinated promissory note the subordinated seller note in the original principal amount of million 
in connection with our acquisition of aram  in july  we  ion international s 
rl ion s rl and certain of our domestic and other foreign subsidiaries as guarantors entered into a million amended and restated revolving credit facility under the terms of an amended and restated credit agreement dated july   as amended to date  the credit agreement  with hsbc bank usa  na  as administrative agent  joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner  abn amro incorporated  as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner  citibank  na  as syndication agent  and the lenders party thereto 
on september   we  ion s rl and certain of our domestic and other foreign subsidiary guarantors amended the terms of the credit agreement by entering into a first amendment to the credit agreement  which added a new million term loan sub facility 
in december  we  ion s rl and certain of our domestic and other foreign subsidiary guarantors entered into two additional amendments to the credit agreement that further modified its terms 
our commercial banking credit facility  as amended to the date of this filing  is referred to as the amended credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources sources of capital revolving line of credit and term facilities below 
we financed the cash portion of the purchase price for aram with i million of revolving credit borrowings and million of five year term loan indebtedness under our amended credit facility see liquidity and capital resources sources of capital revolving line of credit and term facilities below  and ii million in gross proceeds evidenced by a senior increasing rate note that we issued to jefferies finance cp funding llc at the completion of the aram acquisition see liquidity and capital resources sources of capital bridge loan below 

table of contents the terms of the amended purchase agreement had required us to deposit million cash representing a portion of the cash purchase price for the acquisition into escrow on a date after closing to secure the parties obligations to each other for indemnification liabilities and post closing purchase price adjustments 
additionally  the terms of the senior seller note provided that when the senior seller note was repaid  proceeds from that repayment were to be applied to fund the escrow account 
we also entered into guarantees dated september  to guarantee the obligations of ion sub under the senior seller note and the subordinated seller note 
we had expected to repay the indebtedness under the senior increasing rate note  the senior seller note and the subordinated seller note and pay down million in revolving credit indebtedness under our amended credit facility by issuing additional long term debt before the end of in that regard  we had entered into a commitment letter dated september  the commitment letter  with jefferies funding llc jefferies funding  pursuant to which jefferies funding agreed  subject to the terms and upon satisfaction of the conditions contained in the commitment letter  to act in the capacities of sole advisor  sole administrative agent  sole collateral agent if applicable  sole book runner  sole lead arranger and sole syndication agent in connection with a proposed us million senior bridge loan facility 
this proposed senior bridge loan facility was to be drawn upon in the event that certain other long term indebtedness that we would attempt to raise  including high yield unsecured notes  was not successful 
the commitment letter was to terminate by its terms on december  on november   we issued a press release to announce our intention to offer and sell  subject to market and other conditions  million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due in transactions exempt from registration under the securities act including pursuant to rule a under the securities act 
however  prevailing credit market conditions prevented us from successfully completing any issuance of the senior notes 
in december  marketing efforts for the senior notes offering ceased 
in december  we repaid the million revolving credit indebtedness under the amended credit facility from internally generated cash 
on december   we further amended our amended credit facility and refinanced our senior increasing rate note 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
refinancing ion s obligations to the sellers 
as part of the refinancing transactions that closed on december   the terms of the senior seller note were amended and restated  and new subordination provisions were added  by ion sub s issuing an amended and restated subordinated note in replacement of and exchange for the senior seller note 
the amended and restated subordinated note was issued to the same seller holding the senior seller note  maison mazel ltd 
formerly known as alberta ltd 
maison mazel 
the principal amount of the amended and restated subordinated note remained at million and the new maturity date under the amended and restated subordinated note was extended from september  to september  interest on the outstanding principal amount under the note is payable quarterly 
we also entered into an amended and restated guaranty dated december   evidencing our guaranty obligations with respect to the liabilities of ion sub under the amended and restated subordinated note 
also  in connection with the refinancing transactions  ion  ion sub  aram and maison mazel entered into an assignment agreement dated as of december   under which ion  ion sub and aram assigned to maison mazel their rights to an expected canadian federal income tax refund the refund claim  in exchange for the termination  satisfaction and cancellation by maison mazel of the subordinated seller note  and our guaranty of the subordinated seller note 
however  based upon relevant accounting literature  while legally extinguished  the liability under the subordinated seller note was not extinguished on the balance sheet as of december  and was included as short term debt 
the income tax refund is also reflected on our balance sheet netted against our income taxes payable at december  as of february   approximately million of the refund claim had been received by aram and applied against this liability 
we  ion sub  aram and maison mazel also entered into a release agreement dated as of december   whereby the parties agreed to terminate the million purchase price escrow arrangements they had agreed to in the amended purchase agreement  and release maison mazel and the other sellers from their obligations under the amended purchase agreement to indemnify us  ion sub and other ion related indemnified persons for breaches by the sellers of certain of their representations and warranties contained in the amended purchase agreement 
in addition  the parties agreed to certain procedural changes regarding the timing of and the process for the final purchase price adjustments 
it is expected that all of the purchase price adjustments under the amended purchase agreement will be completed

our results of operations and financial condition as of and for the twelve months ended december  were affected by our acquisition of aram on september   which may affect the comparability of certain of the other financial information contained in this form k 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues of million for the year ended december  decreased million  compared to the corresponding period of  principally due to the sharp decline in the global economy  which caused decreased activity and demand for seismic services  most notably in our land imaging systems segment 
land imaging systems net revenues decreased by million  to million compared to million during the twelve months ended december  despite the inclusion of aram s operating results  the division was strongly impacted by the market decline  which resulted in reduced sales of both land systems and vibroseis trucks 
this decrease was also made more pronounced by the inclusion of several large sales of our land acquisition systems that were not duplicated in  including the sale of land acquisition systems to ongc  the sale of our initial version of firefly and significantly increased vibrator truck sales in marine imaging systems net revenues increased million to million  compared to million during the year ended december   principally due to stronger sales of our marine positioning products  including sales related to the full commercialization of our digifin advanced streamer command and control system  the first two commercial sales of our digistreamer system and stronger sales of our marine seismic data acquisition products 
we delivered to rxt the fifth vso system in  however  vso system sales decreased compared to mainly due to the timing of the sales 
our data management solutions net revenues decreased slightly by million  to million compared to million in this change primarily reflects continued energy industry demand for marine seismic work  slightly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between the gbp and the us dollar in ion solutions net revenues increased million  to million  or  compared to million in this increase was due to larger demand related to higher proprietary processing revenues  pre funded multi client seismic surveys primarily off the coasts of alaska and south america and sales of off the shelf seismic data sales 
sales of our pre funded multi client seismic surveys and of off the shelf seismic data increased approximately in compared to gross profit and gross profit percentage 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to the prior year 
gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the improvement in our gross margin percentage was primarily due to the mix of business  including an increase in system sales as well as higher margin sales from our data management solutions segment  including significantly increased sales of our orca software 
this increase was partially offset by slightly lower margins in our land imaging system division relating to inventory write downs directly related to the integration activities of aram into our current operating segment and in our ion solutions segment due to the change in product mix with higher levels of proprietary processing sales 
during  we also wrote down the carrying values of certain of our mature analog land systems and related equipment inventory  resulting in a million charge 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expense was million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
we expect to continue to incur research  development and engineering expenses in at a more conservative rate than in prior years  as we continue to invest in our next generation of seismic acquisition products and services 
for a discussion of our product research and development programs in  see item business product research and development 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense of million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december  increased million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
the increase in our sales and marketing expenditures reflects the hiring of additional sales personnel  increased exhibit and convention costs and increased travel associated with our global marketing efforts 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our corporate branding expenses in  due to the higher expenses in associated with our name change that year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to million in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the 
table of contents years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in expenditures was primarily due to increases in our bad debt reserves of million  in our professional fees relating to our financing efforts of million  in salaries and related expenses of million due to the hiring of additional personnel and an increase in general office expenses related to our acquisition of aram 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense due to the lower operating performance compared to s operating performance 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
at december   we evaluated our reporting units for potential impairment 
based upon our evaluation and given the current market conditions  we determined that approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets related to our land imaging systems  aram systems and ion solutions reporting units were impaired 
we recorded the expense as of december  and reduced the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to income tax expense of million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in tax expense during primarily relates to reduced consolidated income from operations and changes to the valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets 
this decrease was partially offset by deferred taxes on the utilization of acquired net operating losses 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our us net deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the similar period during the decreased effective tax rate for relates primarily to the impairment of goodwill  which has no tax benefit  and a reduction in the valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets offset by deferred tax expense related to the utilization of acquired net operating losses of million 
the and effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rate due to the goodwill impairment in and to the utilization of previously reserved us deferred tax assets in both and preferred stock dividends and accretion 
the preferred stock dividend relates to our series d preferred stock that we issued in february  december and february quarterly dividends must be paid in cash 
dividends are paid at a rate equal to the greater of i per annum or ii the three month libor rate on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus per annum 
all dividends paid to date on the series d preferred stock have been paid in cash 
the series d preferred stock dividend rate was at december  adjustments from preferred stock redemption and conversion features 
our results of operations for reflected additional credits to and charges against our earnings resulting from our outstanding series d cumulative convertible preferred stock the series d preferred stock  series d cumulative convertible preferred stock the series d preferred stock and series d cumulative convertible preferred stock the series d preferred stock and together with the series d preferred stock and the series d preferred stock  the series d preferred stock 
on november   we delivered a notice the reset notice to fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher of our election to reset the conversion prices on our outstanding shares of series d preferred stock 
see liquidity and capital resources sources of capital cumulative convertible preferred stock 
fletcher is the holder of all of the outstanding shares of our series d preferred stock 
by delivering the reset notice to fletcher  we reset the conversion prices on all of our series d preferred stock to per share  in accordance with the terms of our agreement with fletcher dated as of february  as amended  the fletcher agreement 
under the fletcher agreement  if a day volume weighted average trading price per share of our common stock fell below the minimum price  we would be required to i thereafter pay all dividends on shares of series d preferred stock only in cash and ii elect to either a satisfy future redemption obligations by distributing only cash or a combination of cash and common stock  or b reset the conversion prices of all of outstanding shares of series d preferred stock to the minimum price  in which event the series d preferred stock holder would have no further rights to call for the redemption of those shares 
we had originally classified the preferred stock outside of stockholders equity on the balance sheet below total liabilities 
however  with the termination of the redemption rights  there are no other provisions that require cash redemption 
therefore  in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified the preferred stock to stockholders equity 
fair value adjustment of preferred stock redemption features 
the redemption features of our outstanding series d preferred stock and series d preferred stock had been considered embedded derivatives that were required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately at their fair value during these features had been bifurcated as a separate line item in the liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet 
for each quarter during  these redemption features had been re measured at quarter end at their fair value with any resulting gain or loss recognized below income from operations and reflected in earnings for the period 
as a result of the election we made under the reset notice  fletcher is no longer permitted to redeem any shares of our series d preferred stock and the original value of the redemption features of million was credited to our earnings in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents preferred stock beneficial conversion charge 
as a result of the reset notice and the adjustment in november of the conversion prices for the series d preferred stock to the minimum price of per share under the fletcher agreement  we recognized in the fourth quarter of a contingent beneficial conversion feature of the series d preferred stock as a non cash charge to earnings in the amount of million 
under applicable financial accounting guidance  the adjustment of reducing the conversion price was deemed to be equivalent to value being transferred to the holder of the series d preferred stock  with such holder thereby realizing enhanced economic value compared to the holders of other ion securities that did not hold a beneficial conversion feature 
this feature was calculated at its intrinsic value at the original commitment date  and the amount of the charge was limited to the amount of proceeds allocated to the convertible instruments ie the series d preferred stock 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues of million for the year ended december  increased million  compared to the corresponding period last year  principally due to increased activity and demand for seismic services 
land imaging systems net revenues increased by million  to million compared to million during the twelve months ended december  this increase was due to an increase in sales of our land acquisition systems  including the sale of land acquisition systems to ongc  the recognition of our firefly sale in the first quarter of and significantly increased vibrator truck sales compared to marine imaging systems net revenues increased million to million  compared to million during the year ended december  principally due to stronger sales of our marine positioning products  including the first sale of our digifin advanced streamer command and control system  greater demand for our digicourse positioning and source products and an increase in vectorseis ocean vso and source product sales 
we delivered to rxt the fourth vso system in december and expect to begin delivering the next vso system in our data management solutions net revenues increased million  to million compared to million in this increase primarily reflects increased energy industry demand for marine seismic work and sales from our newly launched orca towed streamer navigation and data management applications product line 
ion solutions seismic imaging solutions net revenues increased million  to million compared to million in this increase was due to larger demand related to higher proprietary processing revenues  pre funded multi client seismic surveys primarily off the coasts of alaska  africa and indonesia and sales of off the shelf seismic data sales 
sales showed significant improvement compared to  which included a one time  million multi client seismic library sale that was not duplicated in gross profit and gross profit percentage 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to the prior year 
gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the reduction in our gross margin percentage was primarily due to the recognition of the sale in of our first firefly system which  as a newly developed system  had relatively high built in costs of sale and the mix of business  including an increase in sales of lower margin vibroseis trucks by land imaging systems  the impact of lower than average margins related to the ongc sale and the sale of a low margin pre funded multi client survey by ion solutions 
this decrease was partially offset by stronger margins from our marine imaging systems due to increased sales of our source and seabed product lines 
we also had an increase in higher margin sales from our data management solutions segment due to product mix  including significantly increased sales of our orca software 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expense was million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
we expect to continue to incur significant research  development and engineering expenses in at or above these levels on an absolute dollar basis  as we continue to invest heavily in our next generation of seismic acquisition products and services  including products such as firefly and digistreamer

marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense of million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december  increased million compared to million  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period last year 
the reduction in marketing and sales expense as a percentage of net revenues reflects our focus on leveraging our marketing and sales costs with our sales growth 
the increase in our sales and marketing expenditures reflects the hiring of additional sales personnel as well as increased travel associated with our global marketing efforts 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our sales commissions  which reflects more effective utilization of our internal sales force 
we intend to continue investing significant sums in our marketing efforts as we seek to penetrate markets with our new products

general and administrative expense of million for the year ended december  increased million compared to million in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in expenditures was primarily due to higher payroll costs associated with an increase in management and corporate personnel and an increase in travel associated with our global solutions corporate strategy

cumulative convertible preferred stock 
during  we entered into the fletcher agreement and issued to fletcher  shares of our series d preferred stock in a privately negotiated transaction  receiving million in net proceeds 
the fletcher agreement also provided to fletcher an option to purchase up to an additional  shares of additional series of preferred stock from time to time  with each series having a conversion price that would be equal to of an average daily volume weighted market price of our common stock over a trailing period of days at the time of issuance of that series 
in and  fletcher exercised this option and purchased  shares of series d preferred stock for million in december and the remaining  shares of series d preferred stock for million in february 
fletcher remains the sole holder of all of our outstanding shares of series d preferred stock 
until november  all shares of series d preferred stock had substantially similar terms  except for their conversion prices  which were as follows the conversion price for the series d preferred stock was per share  the conversion price for the series d preferred stock was per share  and the conversion price for the series d preferred stock was per share 
the terms of the series d preferred stock had provided that the shares could be redeemed for cash or in shares of common stock  calculated based upon the prevailing market price of our common stock at the time of redemption 
dividends on the shares of series d preferred stock could be payable  at our election  in cash or in shares of our common stock 
to date  all dividends paid on the series d preferred stock have been paid in cash 
under the fletcher agreement  if a day volume weighted average trading price per share of our common stock fell below the minimum price  we were required to deliver the reset notice to fletcher and elect to either satisfy all future redemption obligations by distributing only cash  or a combination of cash and common stock  or reset the conversion prices of all of the outstanding shares of series d preferred stock to the minimum price  in which event fletcher would have no further rights to redeem its shares of series d preferred stock 

table of contents in addition  the fletcher agreement provided that upon our delivery of the reset notice  we would thereafter be required to pay all future dividends on shares of series d preferred stock in cash 
on november   the day volume weighted average trading price per share of our common stock on the new york stock exchange for the previous trading days was calculated to be  and we delivered the reset notice to fletcher in accordance with the terms of the fletcher agreement 
in the reset notice  we elected to reset the conversion prices for the series d preferred stock to the minimum price per share  and fletcher s redemption rights were terminated 
the adjusted conversion price resulting from this election was effective on november  in addition  under the fletcher agreement  the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued or issuable to fletcher upon conversion or redemption of  or as dividends paid on  the series d preferred stock could not exceed a designated maximum number of shares the maximum number  and such maximum number could be increased by fletcher providing us with a day notice of increase  but under no circumstance could the total number of shares of common stock issued or issuable to fletcher with respect to the series d preferred stock ever exceed  shares 
the fletcher agreement had designated  shares as the original maximum number 
on november   fletcher delivered a notice to us to increase the maximum number to  shares  effective february  the new maximum number represents approximately of our total outstanding shares of common stock as of february  calculated in accordance with rule d d under the securities exchange act of 
prior to adjusting the conversion prices for the series d preferred stock to the minimum price  the total outstanding shares of series d preferred stock would have been convertible into  shares of common stock  or approximately of our total outstanding shares of common stock as of february  as a result of these elections and notices fletcher is no longer permitted to redeem its shares of series d preferred stock  we are required to pay all future dividends on the series d preferred stock in cash and may not pay such dividends in shares of our common stock  and the maximum number of shares of common stock into which the shares of series d preferred stock may be converted is  shares 
the conversion prices and number of shares of common stock to be acquired upon conversion are also subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
converting the shares of series d preferred stock at one time could result in significant dilution to our stockholders that could limit our ability to raise additional capital 
see item a 
risk factors 
meeting our liquidity requirements 
based on our forecasts and our liquidity requirements for the near term future  we believe that the combination of our projected internally generated cash and our working capital including our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to fund our operational needs and our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  the present global credit crisis  market volatility  economic downturn and forecasted reduced demand for oil and natural gas all present special challenges for us regarding our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs  at least for the foreseeable future 
see item a risk factors above in this form k 
as of december   we had approximately million in contractual obligations to pay in see future contractual obligations below 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our principal debt agreements 
we believe that  based on our operating plan  we will remain in compliance with these financial covenants during and have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations throughout we also believe that we have the ability to make additional cost reductions in order to mitigate the impact that a decrease in revenues from our operating plan could have on our covenants compliance 
however  even though not currently considered likely  there are certain scenarios and events beyond our control  such as further declines in e p company and seismic contractor spending  significant write downs of accounts receivable  changes in certain exchange rates and other factors  that could cause us to fall out of compliance with certain financial covenants contained in the amended credit facility and the bridge loan agreement 
our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and debt service capabilities 
if we were not able to satisfy all of these covenants  we would need to seek to amend  or seek one or more waivers of  those covenants under the amended credit facility and the bridge loan agreement 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such waivers or amendments  in which case we would likely seek to obtain new secured debt  unsecured debt or equity financing 
however  there also 
table of contents can be no assurance that such debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in the event that we would need to amend the amended credit facility and the bridge loan agreement  or obtain new financing  we would likely incur up front fees and higher interest costs  and other terms in the amendments would likely be significantly less favorable to us than those currently provided under the amended credit facility and the bridge loan agreement 
although we are still evaluating the impact of the current credit crisis and decline in commodity prices on us  we expect that our capital expenditures in will be reduced from levels  other than our undertaking any opportunistic acquisitions or expansion projects 
if there is a significant lessening in demand for our products and services as a result of any prolonged declines in the long term expected price of oil and natural gas  we may see a further reduction in our own capital expenditures and lesser requirements for working capital  which could generate operating cash flows and liquidity compared to the prior period and offset reduced cash generated from operations excluding working capital changes 
we are currently projecting our capital expenditures for to be in the range of million to million 
of that amount  we are estimating that approximately million to million will be spent on investments in our multi client data library  but are anticipating that most of these investments will be underwritten by our customers 
cash flows from operations we have historically financed our operations from internally generated cash and funds from equity and debt financings 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   a decrease of million compared to december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided in our operating activities was primarily due to increased accrued liabilities and accounts payable as well as decreased accounts receivable resulting from increased collections in this increase was partially offset by increased investment in our inventories 
we have adjusted our manufacturing and purchasing plans in order that we can focus on making sales from this inventory in order to reduce our current levels of inventory 
during  we wrote down the carrying values of certain of our mature analog land systems and related equipment inventory  resulting in a million charge 
cash flows from investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the principal uses of our cash for investing activities during the year ended december  were million expended to acquire aram in september  million of equipment and rental equipment purchases and a million investment in our multi client data library 
this was partially offset by million of cash we acquired in the aram acquisition and proceeds from the sale of assets and rental assets of million 
cash flows from financing activities net cash flow provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net cash flow provided by financing activities during was primarily related to million of net proceeds from acquisition debt we borrowed to purchase aram  million of net borrowings on our revolving credit facility  million in proceeds from the issuance and sale of our series d preferred stock in february and million in proceeds related to the exercise of stock options and stock purchases by our employees under our employee plans 
this cash inflow was partially offset by scheduled principal payments of million on our notes payable and capital lease obligations and million in cash dividends paid on our outstanding series d  series d and series d preferred stock 
inflation and seasonality inflation in recent years has not had a material effect on our costs of goods or labor  or the prices for our products or services 
traditionally  our business has been seasonal  with strongest demand in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
future contractual obligations the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations  as of december  in thousands 
table of contents less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable and long term debt interest on notes payable and long term debt obligations equipment capital lease obligations operating leases product warranty purchase obligations total the long term debt and lease obligations at december  included million of revolving credit indebtedness and million under our five year term loan  in each case incurred under our amended credit facility and maturing in and million under our bridge loan agreement due january the remaining amount of these obligations consists of million under our amended and restated subordinated note  million under our subordinated seller note  million indebtedness related to our sale leaseback arrangement and million of short term notes payable 
the million of capital lease obligations relates to aram and gxt s financing of computer equipment purchases 
because we may repay our outstanding indebtedness under the amended credit facility at any time  the interest expense is not included in the above table 
however  if the outstanding principal of million as of december  was not repaid in  the interest expense would be million using the interest rate as of december  for further discussion of our notes payable  long term debt and capital lease obligations  see note notes payable  long term debt and lease obligations of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the operating lease commitments at december  relate to our leases for certain equipment  offices  processing centers  and warehouse space under non cancelable operating leases 
the liability for product warranties at december  relate to the estimated future warranty expenditures associated with our products 
our warranty periods generally range from days to three years from the date of original purchase  depending on the product 
we record an accrual for product warranties and other contingencies at the time of sale  which is when the estimated future expenditures associated with those contingencies become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
we generally receive warranty support from our suppliers regarding equipment they manufactured 
our purchase obligations primarily relate to our committed inventory purchase orders for which deliveries are scheduled to be made in the original terms regarding our series d preferred stock had provided that the shares of series d preferred stock could be redeemed in cash or in stock or converted into stock  and that dividends could be paid in cash or in stock 
as a result of our election to reset the conversion prices on our series d preferred stock in november  these shares of preferred stock are no longer redeemable at the option of the holder  but remain convertible into shares of our common stock 
therefore  the preferred stock was excluded from the above table 
however  dividends are payable quarterly and must be paid in cash 
the dividend rate was at december  see liquidity and capital resources above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make choices between acceptable methods of accounting and to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risk and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
we believe that all of the judgments and estimates used to prepare our financial statements were reasonable at the time we made them  but circumstances may change requiring us to revise our estimates in ways that could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition 
management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to the estimates in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition and product warranty we derive revenue from the sale and rental of i acquisition systems and other seismic equipment within our land imaging systems and marine imaging systems segments  ii imaging services  multi client surveys and licenses of off the shelf data libraries within our ion solutions segment  and iii navigation  survey and quality control software systems within our data management solutions segment 
for the sales of acquisition systems and other seismic equipment  we follow the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no

our land imaging systems segment receives rental income from the rental of seismic equipment 
the rental is in the form of operating leases as the lease terms range from a couple of days to several months 
rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the operating lease 
revenues from all imaging and other services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from contract services performed on a day rate basis are recognized as the service is performed 
revenues from multi client surveys are recognized as the seismic data is acquired and or processed on a proportionate basis as work is performed 
under this method  we recognize revenues based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as kilometers acquired or days processed 
upon completion of a multi client seismic survey  the survey data is considered off the shelf and licenses to the survey data are sold to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the license of a completed multi client survey is represented by the license of one standard set of data 
revenues on licenses of completed multi client data surveys are recognized when a signed final master geophysical data license agreement and accompanying supplemental license agreement are returned by the customer  the purchase price for the license is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and no significant uncertainty exists as to the customer s obligation  willingness or ability to pay 
in limited situations  we have provided the customer with a right to exchange seismic data for another specific seismic data set 
in these limited situations  we recognize revenue at the earlier of the customer exercising its exchange right or the expiration of the customer s exchange right 
when separate elements such as an acquisition system  other seismic equipment and or imaging services are contained in a single sales arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we follow the requirements of emerging issues task force eitf accounting for multiple element revenue arrangement  and allocate revenue to each element based upon its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  so long as each such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services 
we generally do not grant return or refund privileges to our customers 
when undelivered elements  such as training courses and engineering services  are inconsequential or perfunctory and not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we recognize revenue on the total contract and make a provision for the costs of the incomplete elements 
for the sales of navigation  survey and quality control software systems  we follow the requirements of sop software revenue recognition  because in those systems the software is more than incidental to the arrangement as a whole 
following the requirements of eitf applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  we consider the hardware within these systems to be a software related item because the software is essential to the hardware s functionality 
as a result  we recognize revenue from sales of navigation  survey and quality control software systems when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the software and software related hardware is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the limited case where a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists in the contract  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained 
these arrangements generally include us providing related services  such as training courses  engineering services and annual software maintenance 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the element or  if vendor specific objective evidence is not available for the delivered element  we apply the residual method 
even though a majority of our software arrangements are licensed on a perpetual basis  we do offer certain time based software licenses 
for these time based licenses  we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term  which is generally two to three years 
we generally warrant that our manufactured equipment will be free from defects in workmanship  material and parts 
warranty periods generally range from days to three years from the date of original purchase  depending on the product 
we provide for estimated warranty as a charge to costs of sales at the time of sale 
multi client data library our multi client data library consists of seismic surveys that are offered for licensing to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the capitalized costs include the costs paid to third parties for the acquisition of data and related activities associated with the data creation activity and direct internal processing costs  such as salaries  benefits  computer related 
table of contents expenses  and other costs incurred for seismic data project design and management 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized  as part of our multi client data library  million  million  and million  respectively  of direct internal processing costs 
our method of amortizing the costs of a multi client data library available for commercial sale is the greater of i the percentage of actual revenue to the total estimated revenue multiplied by the total cost of the project the sales forecast method or ii the straight line basis over a four year period 
the sales forecast method is our primary method of calculating amortization 
the total amortization period of four years represents the minimum period over which benefits from these surveys are expected to be derived 
we have determined the amortization period of four years based upon our historical experience that indicates that the majority of our revenues from multi client surveys are derived during the acquisition and processing phases and during four years subsequent to survey completion 
estimated sales are determined based upon discussions with our customers  our experience  and our knowledge of industry trends 
changes in sales estimates may have the effect of changing the percentage relationship of cost of services to revenue 
in applying the sales forecast method  an increase in the projected sales of a survey will result in lower cost of services as a percentage of revenue  and higher earnings when revenue associated with that particular survey is recognized  while a decrease in projected sales will have the opposite effect 
assuming that the overall volume of sales mix of surveys generating revenue in the period was held constant in  an increase in in the sales forecasts of all surveys would have decreased our amortization expense by approximately million 
we estimate the ultimate revenue expected to be derived from a particular seismic data survey over its estimated useful economic life to determine the costs to amortize  if greater than straight line amortization 
that estimate is made by us at the project s initiation 
for a completed multi client survey  we review the estimate quarterly 
if during any such review  we determine that the ultimate revenue for a survey is expected to be more or less than the original estimate of total revenue for such survey  we decrease or increase as the case may be the amortization rate attributable to the future revenue from such survey 
in addition  in connection with such reviews  we evaluate the recoverability of the multi client data library  and if required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  record an impairment charge with respect to such data 
there were no significant impairment charges during and reserve for excess and obsolete inventories our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories is based on historical sales trends and various other assumptions and judgments  including future demand for our inventory and the timing of market acceptance of our new products 
should these assumptions and judgments not be realized for reasons such as delayed market acceptance of our new products  our valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect actual results 
our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  the increase in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories primarily relates to our analog land acquisition systems 
as a result of the planned integration of aram into our land imaging systems segment  we evaluated and determined that market values of certain of our mature analog products were lower than their then current book values 
as a result  we wrote down the inventory to its expected market value  which resulted in a charge to cost of products of approximately million 
goodwill and other intangible assets for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas  we established the following reporting units land imaging systems  aram systems  sensor geophone  marine imaging systems  data management solutions  and ion solutions 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted future returns valuation method 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  our impairment test results could differ 
sfas requires us to compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting units is less than its carrying value 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december  and determined that all of the goodwill within our land imaging systems  aram systems and ion solutions reporting units were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the decrease in these reporting units fair value was primarily driven by the overall economic and financial crisis and the decrease in the current demand for our land analog acquisition products  especially within north america and russia 
in making this assessment we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  internal and external economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and external market data 

table of contents our remaining goodwill of million relates to our marine imaging systems and data management solutions reporting units 
our annual impairment test indicated that the fair value of these two reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
our intangible assets other than goodwill relate to proprietary technology  patents  customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreements that are amortized over the estimated periods of benefit ranging from to years 
following the guidance of sfas  we review the carrying values of these intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
any impairment determined is recorded in the current period and is measured by comparing the fair value of the related asset to its carrying value 
for the year ended december   we determined that certain of the intangible assets customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreements associated with our aram acquisition were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
similar to our treatment of goodwill  in making these assessments we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  internal and external economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and external market data 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
accounts and notes receivable collectibility we consider current information and circumstances regarding our customers ability to repay their obligations  such as the length of time the receivable balance is outstanding  the customers credit worthiness and historical experience  and consider an account or note impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due 
when we consider an account or note as impaired  we measure the amount of the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows or the fair value of collateral 
we include impairment losses recoveries in our allowance for doubtful accounts and notes through an increase decrease in bad debt expense 
we record interest income on investments in notes receivable on the accrual basis of accounting 
we do not accrue interest on impaired loans where collection of interest according to the contractual terms is considered doubtful 
among the factors we consider in making an evaluation of the collectibility of interest are i the status of the loan  ii the fair value of the underlying collateral  iii the financial condition of the borrower  and iv anticipated future events 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the recognition provisions of sfas r share based payment 
we estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to our employees outstanding stock based awards 
the total expense in was comprised of million reflected in cost of sales  million in research and development expense  million in marketing and sales expense  and million in general and administrative expense 
in addition to the share based compensation expense related to the company s plans  we recorded million of share based compensation expense in related to employee stock appreciation rights 
pursuant to sfas r  the stock appreciation rights are considered liability awards and  as such  these amounts are accrued in the liability section of the balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fsp fsp fas no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp was effective on issuance and provided further guidance and clarity to sfas as it specifically relates to assets with inactive markets 
the literature also amends some examples in sfas to better illustrate the determination of fair value in these assets 
the adoption of fsp did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued eitf no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to a entity s own stock eitf 
eitf re evaluates the scope exceptions in sfas for purposes of determining if an 
table of contents instrument or embedded feature is considered indexed to its own stock and thus qualifies for a scope exception 
the provisions for eitf are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier adoption prohibited 
we do not anticipate the adoption of eitf will have a material impact to our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued staff position fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this fsp would require unvested share based payment awards containing non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid to be included in the computation of basic earnings per share according to the two class method 
we have determined that the adoption of fsp eitf will not have a material impact on our earnings per share computation 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas 
sfas provides more guidance on disclosure criteria and requires more enhanced disclosures about a company s derivative and hedging activities 
the provisions for sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  with earlier adoption allowed 
we will adopt sfas upon its effective date 
we do not anticipate the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
the new standard will significantly change the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions in the consolidated financial statements 
it will require an acquirer to recognize  at the acquisition date  the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at their full fair values as of that date 
in a business combination achieved in stages step acquisitions  the acquirer will be required to remeasure its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition date fair value and recognize the resulting gain or loss in earnings 
the acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs will no longer be included as part of the capitalized cost of the acquired entity but will be required to be accounted for separately in accordance with applicable gaap in the us sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas allows companies the option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  establishes presentation and disclosure requirements and requires additional disclosure surrounding the valuation of the financial assets and liabilities presented at fair value on the balance sheet 
the provisions of sfas became effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we did not elect the fair value option for any of our financial assets or liabilities  and therefore  the adoption of sfas had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
credit and sales risks no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  however  our top five customers in total represented approximately  and  respectively of our consolidated net revenues 
the loss of any significant customers or deterioration in our relationship with either customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for the twelve months ended december   we recognized million of sales to customers in europe  million of sales to customers in asia pacific  million of sales to customers in africa  million of sales to customers in the middle east  million of sales to customers in latin american countries  and million of sales to customers in the commonwealth of independent states  or former soviet union cis 
the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended december  and  international sales comprised and  respectively  of total net revenues 
in recent years  the cis and certain latin american countries have experienced economic problems and uncertainties 
however  given the recent market downturn  more countries and areas of the world have also begun to experience economic problems and uncertainties 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world or the collectibility of our existing receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we currently require customers in these higher risk countries to provide their own financing and in some cases assist the customer in organizing international financing and export import credit guarantees provided by the united states government 
we do not currently extend long term credit through notes to companies in countries we consider to be inappropriate for credit risk purposes

lapeyre and laitram together owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of february  we acquired digicourse  inc  our marine positioning products business  from laitram in and have renamed it i o marine systems  inc in connection with that acquisition  we entered into a continued services agreement with laitram under which laitram agreed to provide us certain accounting  software  manufacturing  and maintenance services 
manufacturing services consist primarily of machining of parts for our marine positioning systems 
the term of this agreement expired in september but we continue to operate under its terms 
in addition  when we have requested  the legal staff of laitram has advised us on certain intellectual property matters with regard to our marine positioning systems 
under a lease of commercial property dated february   between lapeyre properties llc an affiliate of laitram and ion  we agreed to lease certain office and warehouse space from lapeyre properties until january during  we paid laitram a total of approximately million  which consisted of approximately million for manufacturing services  million for rent and other pass through third party facilities charges  and million for other services 
for the and fiscal years  we paid laitram a total of approximately million and million for these services 
in the opinion of our management  the terms of these services are fair and reasonable and as favorable to us as those that could have been obtained from unrelated third parties at the time of their performance 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as a result  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers  suppliers  and other parties under which we may agree to indemnify the other party to such arrangement from certain losses it incurs relating to our products or services or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract 
some of these indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss limitations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include risks related to interest rates and to foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk on december   we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million  including capital lease obligations 
of that indebtedness  approximately million accrues interest under rates that fluctuate based upon market rates plus an applicable margin 
approximately million in term loan indebtedness and million in total revolving credit indebtedness were outstanding under the amended credit facility at december  the million term loan accrued interest using a libor based interest rate of per annum 
the average effective interest rate for the quarter ended december  under the libor based rate was 
as of december   the million of outstanding revolving credit facility indebtedness accrued interest under the alternate base interest rate using the prime based rate at a rate of per annum 
the average effective interest rate for the quarter ended december  under the alternate base interest rate was 
each basis point increase in the interest rate would have the effect of increasing the annual amount of interest to be paid in total by approximately million 
as of december   the interest rate relating to our million bridge loan entered into on december  was  excluding additional fees 
each basis point increase in the interest rate on the bridge loan would have the effect of increasing the annual amount of interest to be paid in total by approximately million

foreign currency exchange rate risk our operations are conducted in various countries around the world  and we receive revenue from these operations in a number of different currencies with the most significant of our international operations using canadian dollars cad 
as such  our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our functional currency  or the functional currency of many of our subsidiaries  which is not necessarily the us dollar 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including united kingdom  canada  the netherlands  china  venezuela  india  russia  the united arab emirates  and other countries 
our financial results may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
