item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and funding 
competition as a diversified bank that markets credit cards and consumer and commercial financial products and services  we face intense competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non bank providers of financial services 
we compete with national and state banks for deposits  commercial loans and trust accounts and with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits 
we also compete with other financial services providers for loans  deposits  and other services and products 
in addition  we compete against non depository institutions that are able to offer products and services that were typically banking products and services 
in general  in the current economic environment  customers are attracted to depository institutions that are perceived as stable  with solid liquidity and funding 

table of contents we compete with international  national  regional and local issuers of visa and mastercard credit cards  as well as with american express  discover card and  to a certain extent  debit cards 
in general  customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price  credit limit and other product features  and customer loyalty is often limited 
in motor vehicle finance  we face competition from banks and non bank lenders who provide financing for dealer originated loans 
we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our current markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop  or by the broader economic environment 
for a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment  please refer to item a 
risk factors we face intense competition in all of our markets 
intellectual property as part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property  we rely on a variety of protections  including copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and certain restrictions on disclosure and competition

despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization 
our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information 
in addition  our competitors also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry 
the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete

risk factors 
dividends and transfers of funds traditionally dividends to the company from its direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for the company to pay dividends on its stock  make payments on corporate debt securities and meet its other obligations 
there are various federal and state law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to the company through dividends  loans or otherwise 
these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements  federal and state banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus  sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates  and general federal and state regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices 
in general  federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit  without first obtaining regulatory approval  insured depository institutions  such as the banks  from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards 
in the current economic environment  however  we expect that the company may represent a major source of funds for its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
in addition  as a result of our participation in the us department of treasury s tarp capital purchase program cpp  the company must obtain the us treasury s consent to increase dividends on its common stock 
for additional information about the company s participation in the cpp  please refer to us treasury department s capital purchase program participation  under v
