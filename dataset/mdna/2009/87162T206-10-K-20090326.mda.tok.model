item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing small molecule drugs to extend and enhance the lives of patients with severe medical conditions  including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases 
we have three clinical stage drug candidates and several drug candidates in the preclinical and discovery stages  each of which has a distinct chemical structure  mechanism of action  and market opportunity 
each of our drug candidates was discovered and developed internally using our proprietary  unique chemical compound library and integrated discovery engine 
in october  we entered into a global partnership  or gsk agreement  with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  for the joint development and commercialization of elesclomol  one of our oncology drug candidates 
in december  we entered into a partnership  or roche agreement  with hoffmann la roche  or roche  for our cracm inhibitor program  which is currently in the lead optimization stage 
we retain all rights to our other drug candidates and programs 
we believe that our demonstrated ability to generate promising new drug candidates from our discovery platform  our ability to effectively enroll and conduct robust clinical trials  and our ability to enter into attractive partnerships with leading multinational pharmaceutical companies are important competitive advantages 
we believe that these competitive advantages  together with our current diverse pipeline of drug candidates with distinct chemical structures and mechanisms of action  provide us with both near term and long term sustainable growth opportunities 
we were incorporated in march and commenced operations in july since that time  we have been principally engaged in raising capital and in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
we have funded our operations principally with million in net proceeds from private placements of our common stock and series a convertible preferred stock  million in net proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo  and million in non refundable payments under the gsk agreement  including the million upfront payment and million in operational milestones  which  together with the exercise of common stock warrants and options  provided aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million through december  we have also generated funds from government grants  equipment lease financings and investment income 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and collaboration payments receivable  which includes the million non refundable upfront payment under the roche agreement that was received in january also  in january  we achieved a million non refundable operational milestone under the gsk agreement  related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  which was paid by gsk in march in february  we raised million in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in our ipo at per share 
the net offering proceeds to us after deducting approximately million in expenses for underwriters discounts  fees and commissions  legal  accounting  printing  listing and filing fees  and miscellaneous expenses were approximately million 
all outstanding shares of our series a convertible preferred stock and million in accumulated dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock upon the completion of the ipo 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  and eitf no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  we recorded a non cash beneficial conversion charge of approximately million in february in connection with the contingent adjustable conversion feature of the series a convertible preferred stock 
we have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the research and development of our drug candidates 
we have never been profitable and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials  and seek regulatory approval and eventual commercialization 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and may never do so 
key post developments the symmetry phase clinical trial on february   we suspended our global phase clinical trial of elesclomol plus paclitaxel in metastatic melanoma  called the symmetry trial  following a meeting of the independent data monitoring committee  or dmc 
the dmc noted that while an interim review of the primary endpoint of progression free survival  or pfs  showed trends that favored the elesclomol arm of the study  the interim analysis of the secondary endpoint of overall survival  or os  favored the control arm 
the dmc report noted that the dmc cannot be sure whether this is an adverse treatment effect  an effect of differing post progression off study treatments or a chance effect not relating to the study drugs at all and that this was a paradoxical outcome not foreseen prior to study initiation 
the dmc also noted in its report that the os for the elesclomol arm is in the range of what one would expect for survival rates in large  multinational trials in metastatic melanoma  while the os for the control arm was somewhat longer than would be expected 
of note is that the os data from the symmetry trial are not yet mature  in that a relatively small fraction of the total survival events have occurred  meaning that os results from this trial may change substantially over time 
we expect the survival data to mature by the end of based on the interim review  the dmc recommended that unblinded data be released to us  and that we provide appropriate notification to investigators and patients in order that they could jointly make informed decisions on whether to continue therapy 
following our review of the data and further discussion with the dmc  we decided to suspend the symmetry trial and our other ongoing elesclomol trials  including our trial in prostate cancer and our single agent dose escalating trial  pending further analysis of the symmetry trial results 
we also notified the food and drug administration  or fda  of the symmetry trial findings and our decision to suspend all ongoing elesclomol trials 
following our report to the fda  the fda concurred with our decision and placed each of these trials on clinical hold 
in our analysis of the symmetry trial results to date  we have not identified any target organ toxicities or adverse events related to elesclomol that might explain an imbalance of deaths between the two arms 
we and our partner for the elesclomol program  gsk  are currently investigating a number of aspects related to the symmetry trial results that will inform our choices for future direction of this program  including whether or not to restart the program in melanoma and or other cancer indications 
restructuring on march   we committed to a restructuring that consisted primarily of a workforce reduction of approximately positions  to a total of approximately positions to better align our workforce to our revised operating plans following the suspension of our symmetry clinical trial 
we estimate our costs in connection with the workforce reduction  comprised principally of severance  unused vacation payments  benefits continuation costs and outplacement services  will range from million to million 
as a result of terminating these employees  we estimate we may incur an impairment charge for certain research laboratory equipment  computer equipment  and furniture and fixtures due to the fact that these assets may no longer be utilized 
we estimate we will incur additional costs in connection with the suspension of the symmetry trial  including one time contract termination costs and fees and other related costs 
at this time  we are unable to estimate the amount of a possible impairment or contract termination costs as we are in the process of evaluating our facilities and equipment needs and are in contract termination negotiations with certain of our vendors 
substantially all cash payments under the restructuring are expected to be paid during employees directly affected by the restructuring have received notification and will be provided with severance payments 
we expect to complete the restructuring in the second quarter of company strategy our strategy is to use our proprietary chemical compound library and discovery capabilities  as well as strength in designing and effectively conducting robust clinical trials  to discover  develop  and commercialize novel small molecule drug candidates for treating cancer  autoimmune  and chronic inflammatory diseases 
important elements of our long term strategy include reducing risk and increasing the probability of clinical and commercial success by maintaining  and continuously replenishing  a drug candidate pipeline that is diversified across distinct mechanism categories  chemical compound families  and therapeutic opportunities  using our discovery capabilities to expand and protect our intellectual property position and enhance our competitive advantages for each of these programs  including developing intellectual property associated with related chemical structures  mechanism of action  and method of use  using our translational research and biomarker identification capabilities to assist in identifying the most promising patient populations and optimizing the design of clinical trials for our drug candidates  maintaining the flexibility to partner or keep individual programs  in order to achieve the balance of fully owned versus partnered programs that can best enhance long term shareholder value  and maintaining a strong cash position  such that we have the resources and skills to continue both to advance our current pipeline of compounds and replenish our pipeline with new compounds from our discovery engine 
oncology programs we have two clinical stage programs and one preclinical stage program in oncology elesclomol elesclomol is our first in class oncology drug candidate that we believe kills cancer cells by triggering programmed cell death through elevating levels of reactive oxygen species  or ros 
in october  we entered into a global partnership with gsk to jointly develop and commercialize elesclomol for all indications 
in february  we suspended the phase symmetry trial  following a dmc meeting in which the dmc noted that while the primary endpoint of pfs showed trends that favored the elesclomol arm of the study  early analysis of the secondary os endpoint favored the control arm 
we simultaneously suspended the other ongoing studies with elesclomol  including a phase trial of elesclomol in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in prostate cancer and a monotherapy phase trial in solid tumors 
the fda has also placed our elesclomol trials on clinical hold 
we and our partner for the elesclomol program  gsk  are currently investigating a number of aspects related to the symmetry trial results that will inform our choices for future direction of this program  including whether or not to restart the program in melanoma and or other cancer indications 
gsk elesclomol alliance in october  as amended in june  we entered into the gsk agreement  under which we are eligible to receive up to billion in milestones and other payments  as well as share of the profits and losses from sales in the united states and receive double digit tiered royalties from net sales outside of the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  we and gsk will jointly develop and commercialize elesclomol in the united states  and gsk will have exclusive responsibility for the development and commercialization of elesclomol outside the united states 
pursuant to the agreement  we received a non refundable upfront license payment of million in november we are also eligible to receive potential operational  clinical and regulatory milestone payments from gsk of up to million  which include both payments for operational progress  such as trial initiation and enrollment  and payments for positive clinical and regulatory outcomes  such as regulatory approval 
of the million in potential payments  million are related to the development in metastatic melanoma and million are related to the development in other cancer indications 
in addition to milestones related to operational progress in development and clinical and regulatory outcomes  we are eligible to receive up to million in potential commercial milestone payments from gsk based on achieving certain net sales thresholds 
in the year ended december   we achieved million in non refundable operational milestones related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and a million non refundable operational milestone related to the development of elesclomol in another cancer indication 
the corresponding milestone payments were received from gsk in the fourth quarter of in january  we achieved a million non refundable operational milestone under the gsk agreement  related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  which was paid by gsk in march under the gsk agreement  the total worldwide development costs for elesclomol  including the development in metastatic melanoma  are shared according to an agreed targeted percentage  which represents for us a modest share of total costs 
this cost share is realized by us over time through both direct cost reimbursement payments and operational milestone payments 
the gsk agreement specifies an initial period during which we are solely responsible for all development costs  up to an agreed upon limit  associated with specific development activities related to seeking fda approval of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  whether incurred by us or gsk 
also  during this period  gsk is responsible for certain operational milestone payments to us in the amount of up to million 
costs may be incurred by gsk during this period that are related to the development of elesclomol in metastatic melanoma 
such costs are our responsibility and have been recognized as a reduction of revenue under the gsk collaboration in the statement of operations  however  these costs are not required to be paid to gsk until after the final completion of the symmetry trial  as defined in the gsk agreement 
following the initial period when total melanoma development costs have exceeded the pre specified limit  additional costs incurred for the program will no longer be our sole responsibility and will be shared by gsk in accordance with the targeted percentage defined in the gsk agreement 
depending upon the future direction of the elesclomol program  we may be eligible for cost sharing payments under the gsk agreement 
in addition to development in metastatic melanoma  we also fund early clinical development of elesclomol in two other cancer indications 
satisfactory completion of these initial trials would result in certain milestone payments from gsk 
in the united states  our share of the operating profits and losses from the commercialization and sales of elesclomol over the life of the product will range from  with the percentage increasing as the level of annual sales increases 
prior to commercialization  we are responsible for funding of pre commercialization costs in the united states 
we may elect not to participate in co commercialization  in which case we would earn royalties in lieu of profit sharing 
outside of the united states  we will receive double digit tiered royalties 
under the gsk agreement  gsk may  subject to our agreement  purchase up to million of our common stock in two separate tranches upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones 
in the first tranche  gsk would be obligated to buy million of our common stock at our sole discretion 
the per share purchase price would be at a specified premium 
we attributed  of value to this option to require gsk to purchase our common stock 
the second tranche of million of common stock would be subject to the agreement of both us and gsk 
the per share purchase price would be at a specified premium 
gsk may terminate the gsk agreement upon not less than three months written notice at any time prior to the date of the first commercial sale of elesclomol and not less than six months written notice at any time on and after such date 
we are currently working with gsk to evaluate the data from the symmetry trial to determine if we should continue the development of elesclomol or terminate the program 
should gsk elect to terminate the partnership  all rights to the elesclomol program would be returned to us and we would be free to develop elesclomol alone or with another partner 
in such case  we would owe a small royalty to gsk on future sales of elesclomol 
to date  gsk has not notified us of any intent to terminate the gsk agreement 
sta sta is a novel  small molecule hsp inhibitor drug candidate that we are developing for the treatment of a variety of cancers 
sta has a unique chemical structure that is distinct from aag geldanamycin and other ancamycin derivatives 
in preclinical studies  sta has shown the ability to inhibit multiple kinases with comparable potency to  and a broader activity profile than  specific kinase inhibitors such as imatinib gleevec  erlotinib tarceva  and sunitinib sutent 
in addition  sta has shown potency to times greater than the ancamycin family of hsp inhibitors  as well as activity against a wider range of kinases 
in in vivo models  sta has shown strong efficacy in a wide range of cancer types  including cancers resistant to gleevec  tarceva  and sutent 
we believe that this creates a distinct activity profile for sta and is a competitive advantage 
sta ongoing clinical trials we are currently enrolling patients in two phase  open label studies in patients with solid tumor cancers to identify the maximum tolerated dose  or mtd  of sta based on once and twice a week intravenous dosing schedules  respectively 
in addition to an evaluation of safety and tolerability  patients in each of these studies will be assessed for tumor response based on the industry standard response evaluation criteria in solid tumors  or recist  criteria 
we also recently initiated a phase open label clinical study of sta in patients with hematologic cancers  with a twice a week dosing schedule 
later in  we plan to initiate a phase trial in hematologic cancers with a once a week dosing schedule as well as one or more phase studies in solid tumor cancers 
in our phase solid tumor trials  we have escalated multiple dose level cohorts in each study and have to date observed an acceptable safety profile 
we have also seen biomarker activity that has increased with increasing doses of sta in addition to the acceptable safety profile and encouraging signs of biological activity  we have seen two confirmed responses  as defined by recist criteria  and a number of cases of prolonged stable disease 
these responses and cases of stable disease occurred in a patient population that is generally refractory or resistant to treatments with other agents 
we believe that these data are encouraging  suggest clinical activity of sta and support continued evaluation of sta in further studies 
nd generation hsp inhibitors earlier this year  we initiated preclinical development of a follow on  small molecule  injectable hsp inhibitor 
this compound has a unique chemical structure that we believe enhances certain desirable properties 
in addition  we are currently working on a new series of hsp inhibitor compounds that may be orally administered 
these compounds are in the lead optimization stage 
sta sta is a novel  injectable  small molecule compound that disrupts the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and essential nutrients 
in preclinical testing  sta has been shown to target both new and established tumor blood vessels  in contrast to the mechanism of action of angiogenesis inhibitors such as avastin  which only prevent the formation of new tumor vasculature 
sta has shown strong anti tumor activity in a broad range of preclinical cancer models  including prostate  lung  breast  melanoma  and lymphoma 
this program is currently in preclinical development 
our inflammatory disease programs we have one clinical stage program and one pre clinical stage program focusing on treatments for inflammatory diseases 
both of our inflammatory disease programs focus on oral  disease modifying drug candidates that act through novel mechanisms and could potentially target multiple indications 
apilimod sta apilimod is a novel  orally administered  small molecule drug candidate we are developing for the treatment of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory diseases 
apilimod inhibits the production of the cytokines interleukin  or il  and interleukin  or il  and thereby down regulates the inflammation pathways that underlie certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
we submitted the initial ind for apilimod in march we are currently conducting a phase a clinical trial of apilimod in patients with rheumatoid arthritis  or ra 
the ra study completed initial enrollment of patients and the preliminary results showed encouraging biomarker and clinical signals suggesting activity of apilimod in this indication 
we have elected to enroll an additional cohort in this trial to explore a higher dose of apilimod 
we expect to have results from this higher dose cohort in the second half of we are also exploring the possibility of using apilimod in a topical formulation to treat inflammatory diseases of the skin  such as psoriasis 
we have developed a promising prototype formulation and are planning to conduct proof of concept studies in animals during the second half of in addition to apilimod  we have also identified several other small molecule il inhibitors that we believe have comparable activity to apilimod with significantly improved pharmaceutical properties 
we believe that these new compounds represent a promising opportunity to develop next generation drug candidates that could be administered orally at higher doses than apilimod and potentially address a wider range of serious inflammatory diseases with high unmet medical needs 
cracm ion channel inhibitors we have developed novel  small molecule inhibitors of calcium release activated calcium modulator  or cracm  ion channels expressed on immune cells 
the cracm ion channel is the primary route for calcium entry into t cells and other immune cells  regulating multiple immune cell processes important for initiating and maintaining an inflammatory immune response 
our cracm ion channel inhibitors have shown strong anti inflammatory activity in preclinical studies both in vitro and in vivo  inhibiting t cell and mast cell activity  including cytokine release  degranulation  and immune cell proliferation 
potential applications include a wide range of inflammatory diseases and disorders for which modulating t cell and mast cell function has been shown to be critical  including rheumatoid arthritis  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd  allergy  transplant rejection  and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
this program is in the lead optimization stage 
in december  we entered into a global partnership with roche to further develop our cracm inhibitors 
we anticipate nominating a development candidate for preclinical development in and are targeting phase initiation in roche cracm inhibitor alliance in december  we entered into the roche agreement to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels 
the goal is to develop a novel category of oral  disease modifying agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd  allergy  transplant rejection  and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
under the terms of the agreement  roche will fund research to be conducted by us during an initial two year research period 
roche will receive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain products identified prior to the end of this research period 
we retain certain co development and co promotion rights 
all preclinical  clinical  and commercial costs will be paid by roche 
pursuant to the agreement  we received a non refundable upfront license payment of million in january roche will pay all of our research costs  with a minimum of million in committed research support  and all of our development costs for compounds nominated for clinical development 
we are eligible to receive additional payments  for each of three licensed products  should specified development and commercialization milestones be successfully achieved 
development milestones across multiple indications of up to million could be earned for the first product  and up to half of this amount could be earned for each of the second and third products 
commercialization milestones of up to million could be earned for each of three products 
in addition  all commercial costs will be paid by roche 
we will receive tiered royalties on sales of all approved  marketed products 
roche may terminate the agreement on a licensed compound by licensed compound basis upon providing advance written notice  but may not do so with respect to all licensed compounds until after a specified date 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we will seek to generate revenue from product sales and from future collaborative or strategic relationships  which could include research and development  milestone payments  profit sharing and royalties 
in october  we entered into the gsk agreement for our lead drug candidate  elesclomol 
the million non refundable upfront payment we received from gsk in november  together with the  estimated value of an option to require gsk to purchase million of our common stock  is being recognized ratably as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the estimated performance period  the year period through the earliest expiration date of the related patents  which we estimate to be the effective life of the gsk agreement 
we are also recognizing product development milestones as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the same performance period through november and recognize as revenue on the date the milestone is achieved the portion of the milestone payment equal to the applicable amount of the performance period that has elapsed as of the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining development period 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
in the year ended december   we achieved million in non refundable operational milestones related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and a million non refundable operational milestone related to the development of elesclomol in another cancer indication 
the corresponding milestone payments were received from gsk in the fourth quarter of in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of license and milestone revenue under the gsk agreement 
in january  we achieved a million non refundable operational milestone related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  which was paid by gsk in march reimbursements of development costs to us by gsk are recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related development costs are incurred 
reimbursements by us to gsk for costs gsk incurs under the development program are recorded as a reduction of cost sharing revenue in the period in which the costs are incurred by gsk 
reimbursement of gsk s costs in an amount in excess of collaboration revenues otherwise recognized by us in a reporting period may result in negative revenue 
in the year ended december   we recognized  as a reduction to revenue  million of net cost sharing reimbursements to gsk under the gsk agreement as we are solely responsible for funding of the development costs of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma until a specified limit of expenses has been incurred  after which continuing development costs are shared by gsk with us responsible for a modest share of the costs 
depending upon the future direction of the elesclomol program  we may be eligible for cost sharing payments under the gsk agreement 
in december  we entered into the roche agreement to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels 
the million non refundable upfront license payment we received from roche in january is being recognized ratably using the time based model over the estimated performance period which has been defined as the year period through the estimated date of completion of a phase a clinical trial for the first licensed compound 
in the year ended december   we recognized million of license revenue under the roche agreement 
reimbursements of research and development costs to us by roche will be recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related research and development costs are incurred 
development milestones will be recognized as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the same performance period through mid in the future  we expect any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received under the gsk agreement and the roche agreement and from future collaborations or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our drug candidates  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expense consists of costs incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
our research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research  preclinical and clinical activities  payments to third party contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  costs associated with drug formulation and supply of drugs for clinical trials  personnel related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation  benefits and travel  and overhead expenses  including rent and maintenance of our facilities  and laboratory and other supplies 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing our drug candidates 
we believe that accurately projecting total program specific expenses through commercialization is not possible at this time 
the timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  and the related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product manufacturing costs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including with respect to the number of clinical sites included in the trial  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  and the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending or enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may obtain unexpected or unfavorable results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
in  we anticipate that our overall research and development expenses  including personnel costs and external costs in connection with clinical development activities  will decrease due to the suspension of our elesclomol program and subsequent restructuring 
however  certain program costs are expected to increase as we advance clinical development of our sta program and commence preclinical development of our cracm program 
also  a possible restart of the elesclomol program based upon the outcome of the investigation of the results of the symmetry trial may result in increased research and development expenses 
beyond our current lead drug candidates  we anticipate that we will select drug candidates and research projects for further development on an ongoing basis in response to their preclinical and clinical success  as well as commercial potential 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in executive  finance  business and commercial development  investor and medical community relations  human resources and administrative functions 
other costs include stock based compensation costs  directors and officers liability insurance premiums  legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  fees for general legal  accounting  public company requirements and compliance  and other professional services  as well as overhead related costs not otherwise included in research and development 
in  we anticipate that our overall general and administrative expenses  including personnel costs and external commercial development costs  will decrease due to the suspension of our elesclomol program and subsequent restructuring 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we are required to make estimates and judgments with respect to accrued expenses  including long term contract accruals  the recoverability of long lived and deferred tax assets  measurement of stock based compensation and the period of performance under the gsk agreement and the roche agreement 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition collaboration and license agreements our principal sources of revenue may include upfront license payments  development milestones  reimbursement of research and development costs  profit sharing payments  sales milestones and royalties from our collaborations 
we recognize revenue from these sources in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  or sab  emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf no 
 eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf no 
 and eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  or eitf no 
the application of eitf no 
requires subjective analysis and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple element arrangements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual arrangement into separate units of accounting and to determine the fair value to be allocated to each unit of accounting 
we evaluate the multiple deliverables within our respective collaborations in accordance with the provisions of eitf no 
to determine whether the delivered elements that are our obligation have value to our collaborators on a stand alone basis and whether objective reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items exists 
deliverables that meet these criteria are considered a separate unit of accounting 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined and accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
the appropriate recognition of revenue is then applied to each separate unit of accounting 
our deliverables under our collaboration agreements  including the related rights and obligations  contractual cash flows and performance periods  are more fully described in notes and of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain of the deliverables have been combined as a single unit of accounting 
the cash flows associated with the single unit of accounting from the research and development portions of our collaborations are recognized as revenue using a time based model 
under this model  cash flow streams are recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period 
upon achievement of milestones  as defined in the collaboration agreements  revenue is recognized to the extent the accumulated service time  if any  has occurred 
the remainder is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining estimated performance period 
a change in the period of time expected to complete the deliverable is accounted for as a change in estimate on a prospective basis 
revenue is limited to amounts that are non refundable and that our collaborators are contractually obligated to pay us 
collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with gsk in october  we and gsk entered into the gsk agreement  as amended in june  for elesclomol  a novel injectable  small molecule compound that triggers apoptosis  or programmed cell death  in cancer cells  which we believe has potential for the treatment of a broad range of cancer types 
the gsk agreement consists of the following key funding streams an upfront license payment  product development milestones  reimbursements of certain development costs  sales milestones  profit sharing payments and product royalty payments 
the million non refundable upfront license payment we received from gsk in november  together with the  fair value of an option to require gsk to purchase million of our common stock  is being recognized ratably using the time based model over the estimated performance period which has been defined as the year period through the earliest expiration date of the related patents  which we estimate to be the effective life of the gsk agreement 
there has been no change to this estimate to date 
we are also recognizing product development milestones as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the same performance period through november we recognize as revenue on the date the milestone is achieved the portion of the milestone payment equal to the applicable amount of the performance period that has elapsed as of the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining development period 
in the year ended december   we achieved million in non refundable operational milestones related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and a million non refundable operational milestone related to the development of elesclomol in another cancer indication 
the corresponding milestone payments were received from gsk in the fourth quarter of in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of license and milestone revenue under the gsk agreement 
in january  we achieved a million non refundable operational milestone related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  which was paid by gsk in march reimbursements of development costs to us by gsk are recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related development costs are incurred 
reimbursements by us to gsk for costs gsk incurs under the development program are recorded as a reduction of cost sharing revenue in the period in which the costs are incurred by gsk in accordance with eitf no 
reimbursement of gsk s costs in an amount in excess of collaboration revenues otherwise recognized by us in a reporting period may result in negative revenue 
based on the guidance of eitf no 
 we have determined that we are acting as a principal under the gsk agreement and  as such  record these amounts as collaboration revenue 
in the year ended december   we recognized  as a reduction to revenue  million of net cost sharing reimbursements to gsk under the gsk agreement as we are solely responsible for funding of the development costs of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma until a specified limit of expenses has been incurred  after which continuing development costs are shared by gsk with us responsible for a modest share of the costs 
profit sharing payments are based upon a formula that provides for a range of of net profits earned on us sales of products included in the gsk agreement 
royalty revenues are based upon a percentage of net sales in non us territories 
profit sharing payments and royalties from the sales of products included in the gsk agreement will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable  collectibility is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
sales milestones  which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed upon sales thresholds  will be recognized in the period in which the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectability is reasonably assured 
collaborative license agreement with roche in december  we and roche entered into the roche agreement to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels 
the roche agreement consists of the following key funding streams an upfront license payment  product development milestones  reimbursements of certain research and development costs  sales milestones and product royalty payments 
the million non refundable upfront license payment that we received from roche in january is being recognized ratably using the time based model over the estimated performance period which has been defined as the year period through the estimated date of completion of a phase a clinical trial for the first licensed compound 
in the year ended december   we recognized million of license revenue under the roche agreement 
reimbursements of research and development costs to us by roche will be recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related research and development costs are incurred 
development milestones will be recognized as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the same performance period through mid royalty revenues are based upon a percentage of net sales 
royalties from the sales of products included in the roche agreement will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable  collectibility is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
sales milestones  which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed upon sales thresholds  will be recognized in the period in which the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectability is reasonably assured 
deferred collaboration revenue consistent with our policy on revenue recognition  deferred collaboration revenue represents cash received and amounts earned and invoiced for licensing and option fees and milestones  as well as cash received and amounts invoiced for research and development services to be performed by us 
such amounts are reflected as deferred collaboration revenue until revenue can be recognized under our revenue recognition policy 
deferred collaboration revenue is classified as current if management believes we will complete the earnings process and be able to recognize the deferred amount as revenue within months of the balance sheet date 
as of december   total deferred collaboration revenue was approximately million  of which million is current and will be recognized as revenue during the next months 
accrued expenses and accrued contract research liabilities as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
given our current business  the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our business is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in connection with all of the foregoing service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers  including contract research organizations  invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period  our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated 
we currently reflect the over or under accrual of expenses directly in our operations in the period the amount was determined 
our arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed 
we recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion 
the date on which services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract or our ongoing monitoring of service performance 
in the years ended december   and  respectively  we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods 
we currently recognize and plan to continue to recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations 
generally  these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial  monitoring the trial  closing the trial and preparing the resulting data 
with respect to financial reporting periods presented in this annual report on form k  and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers  the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs 
in light of the foregoing  we do not believe our estimates of future expenses and our practice of making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future 
there were no changes in our estimates and accruals for contract service fees that had a material effect on our net losses in the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate valuation method for our option grants 
the black scholes model requires inputs for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility and expected lives of the options 
since we do not have a significant history of stock trading activity  expected volatility is based on historical data from several public companies similar in size and value to us 
we will continue to use a weighted average approach using historical volatility and other similar public entity volatility information until historical volatility of our common stock is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical data 
our options generally vest after one year of service and quarterly over three years thereafter 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we applied a forfeiture rate of to all options that vest upon completion of the first year of service following the date of grant 
the analysis will be re evaluated at least annually and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
the expected lives for options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
since january   we have used the simplified method for determining the expected lives of options 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
accordingly  we amortize the fair value of each option over each option s service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we account for stock options issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  which requires valuing and remeasuring such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
our net loss includes compensation costs in the amount of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangements for employee and non employee awards 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized stock based compensation expense was million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years

these increases were principally due to expenses incurred in connection with elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  including the advancement of the symmetry trial  our global  pivotal phase clinical trial which was initiated in the third quarter of  and the conduct of registration manufacturing and other supporting activities required for a possible new drug application  or nda  filing in in addition  we advanced elesclomol sodium in support of the phase trial in combination with docetaxel in hormone refractory prostate cancer that was initiated in the fourth quarter of and in support of the single agent  dose escalation clinical study in solid tumors that was initiated in the first quarter of  as well as conducted further evaluation of elesclomol in other cancer types 
in  we anticipate that costs under our elesclomol program will decrease significantly due to the suspension of the elesclomol program in february and the subsequent restructuring 
in the year ended december   costs incurred under our sta program decreased by million over the year ended december   including a million decrease for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  offset by a million increase for external costs 
the decrease in internal related costs was principally due to a decrease in resource allocation in connection with the advancement of the sta program from preclinical development into clinical development in the second half of the increase in external costs was principally due to a full year of clinical trial costs and related drug supply manufacturing in support of the two phase clinical trials that were initiated in the fourth quarter of and the phase trial in hematological cancers that was initiated in the first quarter of  offset by nonrecurring costs incurred in to complete preclinical development 
in  we anticipate that our costs incurred under our sta program will increase based upon the phase trial in hematological cancers that was initiated in the first quarter of and additional clinical trials planned to commence later in the year 
in the year ended december   costs incurred in connection with apilimod decreased by million over the year ended december   including a million decrease for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and a million decrease for external costs 
these decreases were principally due to the timing of treating patients in our phase a trial for ra as the treatment for the initial two cohorts of patients was completed in and we began enrolling additional patients to explore a higher dose of apilimod in the second half of in the year ended december   costs incurred under our cracm program decreased by million over the year ended december   including a million decrease for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  offset by a million increase for external costs 
the net decrease was principally due to resource allocation 
in  we anticipate that development costs incurred under our cracm program will increase as we anticipate nominating a candidate and conducting preclinical development 
in addition  in the year ended december   costs incurred under our other early stage programs increased by million over the year ended december   including increases of million for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
general and administrative expense year ended december  to change dollars in millions general and administrative the decrease in general and administrative expense principally resulted from an increase of million for personnel costs and related overhead in connection with increased headcount and stock compensation  offset by a million decrease in external professional fees  including intellectual property and general legal fees  public company reporting and compliance requirements  director and officer insurance premiums  investor and medical community relations and commercial development  as well as in corporate taxes 
in  we anticipate that our overall general and administrative expenses  including personnel costs and external commercial development costs  will decrease due to the suspension of our elesclomol program and subsequent restructuring 
investment income  net year ended december  to change dollars in millions investment income  net the decrease in net investment income was principally due to declining interest rates and lower average cash balances

these increases were principally due to start up expenses incurred in connection with the symmetry trial  our global  pivotal phase clinical trial of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  which was initiated in the third quarter of  offset by non recurring external costs incurred in in connection with the completion of the phase b clinical trial for metastatic melanoma 
in the year ended december   costs incurred in connection with apilimod for the treatment of crohn s disease decreased by million over the year ended december   including a million decrease for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and an million decrease for non recurring external costs

these decreases were principally due to the advancement of the program from preclinical development into clinical development upon the filing of an ind application in the third quarter of and the initiation of two phase clinical trials in the fourth quarter of in addition  in the year ended december   costs incurred under our early stage and discontinued programs decreased by million over the year ended december   including a million increase for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  offset by a million decrease for external costs 
general and administrative expense year ended december  to change dollars in millions general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expense principally resulted from increases of million for personnel costs and related overhead in connection with increased headcount and stock compensation  and million in external professional fees  including investor and medical community relations  public company reporting and compliance requirements and increased director and officer insurance premiums following completion of our ipo in february  as well as intellectual property and general legal fees 
investment income  net year ended december  to change dollars in millions investment income  net the increase in net investment income was principally due to the higher average cash balances resulting from the net cash proceeds of million raised from the sale of our common stock in our ipo in february and the million non refundable upfront payment received from gsk in november liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
we have funded our operations principally with million in net proceeds from private placements of our common stock and series a convertible preferred stock  million in net proceeds from our ipo  and million in non refundable payments under the gsk agreement  including the million upfront payment and million in operational milestones  which  together with the exercise of common stock warrants and options  provided aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million through december  we have also generated funds from government grants  equipment lease financings and investment income

in addition  we are eligible to receive up to million in potential commercial milestone payments from gsk based on achieving certain net sales thresholds 
in the year ended december   we achieved million in non refundable operational milestones related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and a million non refundable operational milestone related to the development of elesclomol in another cancer indication 
the corresponding milestone payments were received from gsk in the fourth quarter of in january  we achieved a million non refundable operational milestone related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  which was paid by gsk in march depending upon the future direction of the elesclomol program  we may be eligible for cost sharing and additional milestone payments under the gsk agreement 
in december  we entered into the roche agreement with roche and received a non refundable upfront license payment of million in january under the terms of the agreement  roche will pay all of our research costs  with a minimum of million in committed research support  and all of our development costs for compounds nominated for clinical development 
we are eligible to receive additional payments  for each of three licensed products  should specified development and commercialization milestones be successfully achieved 
development milestones across multiple indications of up to million could be earned for the first product  and up to half of this amount could be earned for each of the second and third products 
commercialization milestones of up to million could be earned for each of three products

our operating activities provided cash of million in the year ended december   including the million non refundable upfront payment received under the gsk agreement in november  offset by million in the use of cash in operations 
the use of cash in all of these periods principally resulted from our losses from operations  as adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and stock based compensation  and changes in our working capital accounts

contractual obligations as of december  total through through more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations research and development contracts consulting purchase obligations total including scheduled interest payments 
research and development contracts principally include contracts for human clinical studies  animal studies and clinical manufacturing 
the future research and development contract obligations in the table of contractual obligations and commitments above reflect the suspension of the elesclomol program in february and otherwise assume that each of the other studies and related manufacturing contracts is completed as planned 
in the event a study or manufacturing contract is terminated prior to the planned completion by mutual agreement between the contractor and us  the amount paid under such contracts may be less than the amounts presented 
we are currently working with gsk to evaluate the data from the symmetry trial to determine if development of the elesclomol program should continue 
if development of the elesclomol program was to continue certain of the above research and development obligations may be higher 
under various license agreements  substantially all of which are related to our early stage discovery programs  we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million if specified development and commercialization milestones are met  as follows in millions 
these amounts are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments above

our funding requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our determination  based on the ongoing analysis of the data from the recently suspended phase symmetry trial  to continue the development of elesclomol or to terminate the development program  our ability to fulfill our obligations under and otherwise maintain the gsk agreement and for gsk to satisfy its obligations under the gsk agreement  including payment of funding obligations and milestone payments  the progress and results of our ongoing phase and phase clinical trials of sta  any additional phase or phase clinical trials of sta we may initiate and any later stage clinical trials we may initiate in the future based on the results of the earlier stage clinical trials  the results of our preclinical studies of sta and testing of our cracm inhibitors  and our decision to initiate clinical trials  if supported by the preclinical and other test results  our ability to fulfill our obligations under and otherwise maintain the roche agreement and for roche to satisfy its obligations under the roche agreement  including payment of funding obligations and milestone payments  the costs  timing  and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates  the progress and results of the current phase a clinical trial of apilimod for the treatment of ra and any future clinical trials we may initiate for ra or other inflammatory disease indications  the scope  progress  results  and cost of preclinical development  clinical trials  and regulatory review of any new drug candidates we may discover or acquire  the costs of preparing  filing  and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing  and defending intellectual property related claims  our ability to establish additional strategic collaborations and licensing or other arrangements on terms favorable to us  the costs to satisfy our obligations under potential future collaborations  and the timing  receipt  and amount of sales or royalties  if any  from elesclomol  apilimod  sta  sta  our cracm inhibitors and our other potential products 
liquidity on february   we announced that we were suspending all clinical development of our lead drug candidate  elesclomol 
on march   we committed to a restructuring that consisted primarily of a workforce reduction of approximately positions  to a total of approximately positions to better align our workforce to our revised operating plans following the suspension of our symmetry clinical trial 
we estimate our costs in connection with the workforce reduction  comprised principally of severance  unused vacation payments  benefits continuation costs and outplacement services  will range from million to million 
as a result of terminating these employees  we estimate we may incur an impairment charge for certain research laboratory equipment  computer equipment  and furniture and fixtures due to the fact that these assets may no longer be utilized 
we estimate we will incur additional costs in connection with the suspension of the symmetry trial  including one time contract termination costs and fees and other related costs 
at this time  we are unable to estimate the amount of impairment or contract termination costs as we are in the process of evaluating our facilities and equipment needs and are in contract termination negotiations with certain of our vendors 
substantially all cash payments under the restructuring are expected to be paid during employees directly affected by the restructuring have received notification and will be provided with severance payments 
we expect to complete the restructuring in the second quarter of we do not anticipate that we will generate product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we expect our continuing operating losses to use cash for operations over the next several years and such cash use may increase from year to year 
based on our current operating plans  we expect our existing funds  including the million upfront license payment under the roche agreement that was received in january and the million operational milestone payment under the gsk agreement that was received in march  together with research and development reimbursements and approximately million of milestone payments anticipated in connection with certain preclinical and clinical achievements anticipated under the roche agreement  will be sufficient to fund operations for approximately two years 
while we believe that the milestone payments from roche will be received as forecasted  we have contingency plans in place should the receipt of the milestone payments be delayed or not achieved at all or if clinical progress in our various programs does not progress as expected  which plans focus on the reduction of spending on less critical research and development activities 
there are numerous factors that are likely to affect our spending levels  including the extent of clinical trials and other development activities for sta  our second generation hsp inhibitor  sta  apilimod  cracm inhibitors in collaboration with roche  the timing and amount of milestone payments to be received from roche  the rate of enrollment of patients in clinical trials  the progress of our discovery research and preclinical programs  the impact of potential business development activities and future direction of the elesclomol program  among other factors 
in addition  depending upon the future direction of the elesclomol program  we may also incur additional expenses and may correspondingly receive cost sharing and milestone payments under our agreement with gsk 
these variables could result in higher or lower spending levels which could impact the sufficiency of our current funds if we are to continue operations in accordance with our current plans and achieve our intended timelines for development 
we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional pre clinical and discovery activities 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  collaboration agreements  debt financings or licensing arrangements 
however  the credit markets and the financial services industry have recently been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling debt securities  if convertible  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million consisting of cash deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states and in a short term us treasury money market fund 
marketable securities consist of investments in high grade corporate obligations and united states government agencies that are guaranteed by the united states government 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we did not have material exposure to high risk investments  such as mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities or other special investment vehicles  or siv s  within our money market fund investments 
we also believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
tax loss carryforwards in and in  we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership  as defined by section of the internal revenue code  that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we determined that we experienced a change in ownership  as defined by section  in connection with the acquisition of principia associates  inc on september   but did not experience a change in ownership upon the effectiveness of our ipo 
as a result  the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited 
as of december  we have net operating loss carryforwards for us federal tax purposes of approximately million  after taking into consideration net operating losses expected to expire unused as a result of this limitation  and the remainder will expire in varying amounts through unless utilized 
in addition  as of december   we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire through unless utilized 
the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited as we experience future ownership changes as defined in section of the internal revenue code

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million consisting of cash deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states and in a short term us treasury money market fund  as well as of high grade commercial paper and government agency securities that are guaranteed by the us government 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we did not have material exposure to high risk investments such as mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities or other special investment vehicles  or siv s  within our money market fund investments 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
during the year ended december   we had investment income of million 
if overall interest rates fell by during the year ended december   our interest income would have decreased by less than million  assuming consistent investment levels 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources 
one possible source of funding is through further equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
