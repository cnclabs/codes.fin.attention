executive overview we use problem solving design and performance innovation to enhance the quality of human habitats worldwide  making our customers lives more productive  rewarding  delightful  and meaningful 
we do this by providing high quality products and related knowledge services 
at present  most of our customers come to us for work environments in both corporate office and healthcare settings 
we also have a growing presence in educational and residential markets  including home office 
our primary products include furniture systems  seating  storage and material handling solutions  freestanding furniture  and casegoods 
our services extend from workplace to furniture asset management 
we extended our industry leading position in seating as we introduced the neocon award winning embody tm chair and setu tm family of seating 
we are globally positioned in terms of manufacturing operations 
in the united states  our manufacturing operations are located in michigan  georgia  and washington 
in europe  we have a significant manufacturing presence in the united kingdom  our largest marketplace outside of the united states 
in asia  we have manufacturing operations in ningbo  china 
our products are sold internationally through wholly owned subsidiaries or branches in various countries including canada  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  australia  singapore  china  india  and the netherlands 
our products are offered elsewhere in the world primarily through independent dealerships 
we have customers in over countries 
we manufacture our products using a system of lean manufacturing techniques collectively referred to as the herman miller performance system hmps 
we strive to maintain efficiencies and cost savings by minimizing the amount of inventory on hand 
accordingly  production is order driven with direct materials and components purchased as needed to meet demand 
the standard lead time for the majority of our products is to days 
as a result  the rate of our inventory turns is high 
these combined factors could cause our inventory levels to appear relatively low in relation to sales volume 
a key element of our manufacturing strategy is to limit fixed production costs by sourcing component parts from strategic suppliers 
this strategy has allowed us to increase the variable nature of our cost structure while retaining proprietary control over those production processes that we believe provide us a competitive advantage 
as a result of this strategy  our manufacturing operations are largely assembly based 
our business consists of various operating segments as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
these operating segments are determined on the basis of how we internally report and evaluate financial information used to make operating decisions and are organized by the various markets we serve 
for external reporting purposes  we aggregate these operating segments as follows 
north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products primarily though a certified dealer network for office  learning and healthcare environments throughout the united states  canada  and mexico 
non north american furniture solutions includes the business associated with the design  manufacture  and sale of furniture products primarily for work related settings outside north america 
other includes our north american residential furniture business as well as other business activities such as convia  and unallocated corporate expenses 
core strengths we rely on the following core strengths in delivering workplace solutions to our customers 
problem solving design and innovation we are committed to developing research based functionality and aesthetically innovative new products and have a history of doing so 
we believe our skills and experience in matching problem solving design with the workplace needs of our customers provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
an important component of our business strategy is to actively pursue a program of new product research  design  and development 
we accomplish this through the use of an internal research and design staff as well as third party design resources generally compensated on a royalty basis 
operational excellence we were among the first in our industry to embrace the concepts of lean manufacturing 
hmps provides the foundation for all of our manufacturing operations 
we are committed to continuously improving both product quality and production and operational efficiency 
we have begun to extend this lean process work externally to our manufacturing supply chain and to our distribution channel 
we believe this work holds great promise for further gains in reliability  quality and efficiency 
building and leading networks we value relationships in all areas of our business 
we consider our networks of innovative designers  owned and independent dealers  and suppliers to be among our most important competitive factors and vital to the long term success of our business 
channels of distribution our products and services are offered to most of our customers under standard trade credit terms between and days and are sold through the following distribution channels 
independent contract furniture dealers and licensees most of our product sales are made to a network of independently owned and operated contract furniture dealerships doing business in many countries around the world 
these dealers purchase our products and distribute them to end customers 
we recognize revenue on product sales through this channel once our products are shipped and title passes to the dealer 
many of these dealers also offer furniture related services  including product installation 
owned contract furniture dealers at may   we owned contract furniture dealerships  some of which have operations in multiple locations 
the financial results of these owned dealers are included in our consolidated financial statements 
product sales to these dealerships are eliminated as inter company transactions from our consolidated financial results 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped to the end customer and installation is substantially complete 
we believe independent ownership of contract furniture dealers is generally  the best model for a financially strong distribution network 
with this in mind  our strategy is to continue to pursue opportunities to transition our owned dealerships to independent owners 
where possible  our goal is to involve local managers in these ownership transitions 
direct customer sales we sometimes sell products and services directly to end customers without an intermediary eg sales to the us federal government 
in most of these instances  we contract separately with a dealership or third party installation company to provide sales related services 
we recognize revenue on these sales once products are shipped and installation is substantially complete 
independent retailers certain products are sold to end customers through independent retail operations 
revenue is recognized on these sales once products are shipped and title passes to the independent retailer 
challenges ahead like all businesses  we are faced with a host of challenges and risks 
we believe our core strengths and values  which provide the foundation for our strategic direction  have us well prepared to respond to the inevitable challenges we will face in the future 
while we are confident in our direction  we acknowledge the risks specific to our business and industry 
refer to item a of our annual report on form k for discussion of certain of these risk factors 
future avenues of growth we believe we are well positioned to successfully pursue our mission despite the risks and challenges we face 
that is  we believe we can continue to improve the performance of human habitats worldwide 
in pursuing our mission  we have identified the following as key avenues for our future growth 
primary markets capturing additional market share within our primary markets by offering superior solutions to customers who value space as a strategic tool 
adjacent markets further applying our core skills in space environments such as healthcare  higher education  and residential 
developing economies expanding our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential new markets developing new products and technologies that serve new markets industry analysis the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma is the trade association for the us domestic office furniture industry 
we monitor the trade statistics reported by bifma and consider them an indicator of industry wide sales and order performance 
bifma publishes statistical data for the contract segment and the office supply segment within the us furniture market 
the us contract segment is primarily with large to mid size corporations installed via a network of dealers 
the office supply segment is primarily to smaller customers via wholesalers and retailers 
we primarily participate  and are a leader in  the contract segment 
it is important to note that our diversification strategy lessens our dependence on the us office furniture market 
we also analyze bifma statistical information as a benchmark comparison against the performance of our domestic us business and also to that of our competitors 
the timing of large project based business may affect comparisons to this data 
finally  bifma regularly provides its members with industry forecast information  which we use internally as one of many considerations in our short and long range planning process 
discussion of business conditions our fiscal years ended may  and may  each included weeks of operations 
fiscal was a year marked with unprecedented economic challenges and uncertainties 
we are encouraged by our achievements in the face of these economic conditions 
we were able to maintain solid operating income performance despite a rapid and steep decline in revenue  as we acted quickly to adjust our cost structure 
while we took significant steps in reducing our cost structure  it did not prevent us from continuing to invest in our strategy of problem solving design and innovation 
we introduced several new products designed to reach customers in nearly all areas of our business 
these new products made a strong showing at neocon  the contract furniture industry s largest tradeshow 
our newly introduced chair  setu tm  won gold for conference room seating  and silver in the lounge seating category 
our embody tm chair won silver in task seating and we were named manufacturer of the year by the office furniture dealers association for the second year in a row 
in fiscal  we significantly changed our capital structure to align with the economic conditions 
we suspended our share repurchases and focused on cash conservation and strengthening our balance sheet 
our intent to conserve cash is both a defensive strategy as well as offensive 
we reduced our dividend in the fourth quarter from 
per share to 
per share 
this adjustment aligns our dividend payout with our historic dividend metrics 
we also announced and implemented several initiatives to improve our operating profitability and cash flow 
we put in place a restructuring action that eliminated approximately  full time positions and temporary workers 
we took further action to reduce our cost structure by million by adjusting our work schedule  working out of every days  and suspending our k match 
all these actions allowed us to end the year with a cash and investment balance of million 
given the uncertain nature of the current economic environment we have taken a number of actions to increase our financial strength and flexibility 
at the same time  we believe there will be opportunities to increase market share for companies that are able to take advantage of these conditions 
for example  subsequent to year end we announced the acquisition of nemschoff chairs  llc  nemschoff a provider of lobby room seating and furnishings  administrative office lounge seating  and a wide range of healthcare patient room furniture products 
we believe this acquisition  coupled with our recent acquisition of brandrud  will make us the number one provider of furniture in healthcare environments 
additionally  after year end we renegotiated our syndicated revolving line of credit  reducing our availability from million to million  while giving us additional covenant flexibility 
we also completed the repurchase of million of our outstanding public bonds 
in addition to improving our covenant metrics this action also significantly reduces our interest expense moving forward 
in may we announced the closing of a manufacturing facility 
this closing  which will take place over the next to months  will provide significant savings once completed 
as a result of our hmps process improvements  we do not believe this causes a reduction to our long term manufacturing capacity 
while many of the decisions we made were difficult and had negative impacts on some of our employee owners  they were made as a result of unprecedented economic conditions 
overall we are pleased with our performance for the year and the opportunities in front of us 
looking forward  the general economic outlook for our industry in the us is expected to be negative through calendar year  and we remain appropriately cautious as a result 
bifma issued its most recent report in may expecting that the growth rate of office furniture orders and shipments in the us for calendar will be negative percent and percent  respectively 
for calendar  bifma expects positive percent and percent growth for orders and sales  respectively 
this forecasted improvement is based upon an assumption of a slight improvement in the us economy in the fourth quarter of calendar and the first quarter of financial results the following is a comparison of our annual results of operations and year over year percentage changes for the periods indicated 
dollars in millions fiscal chg from fiscal chg from fiscal net sales    cost of sales    gross margin operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense minority interest  net of tax na net earnings the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the components of the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal year ended may  may  june  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses restructuring design and research expenses total operating expenses operating earnings net other expenses earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings net sales  orders  and backlog fiscal compared to fiscal for the fiscal year ended may   consolidated net sales declined percent to  million from  million in fiscal this year over year decline was driven by the global economic environment and was experienced across nearly all operating and geographic units 
the strengthening of the us dollar during fiscal against most major foreign currencies reduced our top line by approximately million 
consolidated net trade orders for fiscal totaled  million 
this is comparable to net trade orders of  million last year  and represents a decrease of percent 
starting with the financial market volatility in the early fall in part related to the instability in the banking industry we experienced a sudden and dramatic fall in order rates through most of the third quarter 
orders rates stabilized through the fourth quarter  albeit at much lower level than last year 
the strong dollar reduced orders by approximately million compared with the prior year 
our backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  a percent decline from million at the end of fiscal bifma reported an estimated year over year decline in us office furniture shipments of approximately percent for the twelve month period ended may by comparison  the net sales decline for our domestic us business was approximately percent 
we believe that while comparisons to bifma are important  we continue to pursue a strategy of revenue diversification that makes us less reliant on the drivers that impact bifma 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales of  million in fiscal year increased million from fiscal this increase of percent was driven by growth within both of our reportable business segments 
consolidated net trade orders in fiscal totaled  million representing a year over year growth of percent from orders of  million in fiscal the backlog of unfilled orders at the end of fiscal totaled million  decreasing percent from the fiscal level of million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring program designed to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability 
these actions included the elimination of approximately full time positions within the north american furniture solutions segment 
the positions that were eliminated represented a variety of functional areas  and the individuals affected were offered one time termination benefits  including severance and outplacement services 
pre tax restructuring expenses for fiscal of million  are reflected separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
the related cash payments were million in fiscal the balance of the restructuring accrual at may  was million  and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet within other accrued liabilities 
discussion of business segments fiscal compared to fiscal net sales within our north american furniture solutions segment decreased from  million in fiscal to  million in the current year 
this represents a year over year decrease of million or percent 
we experienced a decline throughout our north american business operations  however  there were customer types within this segment that performed better than the overall average  primarily education  government and healthcare customers 
operating earnings for the segment in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to segment earnings of million or percent in the prior year 
with a top line decline of percent within the segment  we saw both dollar and percent of sales decreases to operating earnings in the north american furniture solutions segment 
this segment s ability to generate strong operating performance despite a significant decline in volume is largely due to the variable business model in place  which allowed costs to be shed as the top line declined as well as our execution of the restructuring plan discussed above 
net sales from our non north american furniture solutions segment declined million or from the prior year 
the decline was compounded by the strengthening of the us dollar against most foreign currencies 
nearly every region within the segment posted decreases in year over year net sales 
there were pockets of resiliency including the middle east  south america  and australia 
total net sales for the segment were million  versus million in the prior year 
the regions which were the hardest hit by the current economy were the uk which was down  and japan  down 
operating earnings within our non north american segment totaled million for the year or percent of net sales 
this compares to million or percent of net sales in fiscal  a decrease of basis points 
despite the decline in operating income  our low fixed cost model generated positive income with rapid declines in the top line 
net sales within the other segment category were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is the result of net sales declining within our north american home business  primarily due to the challenges associated with the us macroeconomic environment 
this overall decrease was somewhat offset by sales to a new retail customer 
the us dollar strengthened against most major currencies throughout fiscal the changes in currency exchange rates from the prior year affected the us dollar value of net sales within both primary operating segments 
we estimate these changes effectively decreased our fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million  driven largely by the us dollar canadian dollar and the mexican peso average exchange rate during the current year 
currency exchange rate fluctuations within our non north american furniture solutions segment decreased net sales in fiscal by approximately million 
this was primarily driven by movements in the us dollar british pound sterling 
it is important to note that period to period changes in currency exchange rates have a directionally similar impact on our international cost structures 
operating earnings within our non north american segment increased an estimated million in fiscal due to the aforementioned changes in currency exchange rates relative to the prior year level 
the estimated impact on operating earnings of our north american business segment was a decrease of approximately million 
discussion of business segments fiscal compared to fiscal net sales within our north american furniture solutions segment increased from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal this represents a year over year increase of million or percent 
we experienced growth throughout our north american business operations  but particularly strong growth was experienced in the healthcare industry which posted double digit year over year growth 
the healthcare industry remains a key growth area within the segment and lines up with our strategy to pursue diversification 
sales at our mexican subsidiary again reached double digit growth over fiscal canadian sales turned around from a flat year in to impressive double digit growth in fiscal operating earnings for the segment in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to segment earnings of million or percent in fiscal with top line growth of percent within the segment  we saw both dollar and percent of sales increases to operating earnings in the north american furniture solutions segment 
this segment s strong operating performance is largely due to improved margins on certain recently introduced products  our focus on cost management  and our execution of the restructuring plan discussed above 
net sales from our non north american furniture solutions segment grew at double digit rates 
every region within the segment posted increases in year over year net sales 
total net sales for the segment were million  up million or percent 
sales generated from our non north american furniture solutions segment increased to percent of our consolidated net sales  an increase of basis points from percent in fiscal the largest sales contribution within this segment came from our operations in the united kingdom  which posted a percent year over year increase to the top line 
we also saw a strong increase in net sales within continental europe 
our results within the asia pacific region are particularly noteworthy  growing by percent from fiscal we continued to pursue our diversification strategy and the effects are clearly visible in these results 
operating earnings within our non north american segment totaled million for the year or percent of net sales 
this compares to million or percent of net sales in fiscal  an increase of basis points 
net sales within the other segment category were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of oem sales of million recognized in fiscal that did not occur in fiscal net sales within our north american home business were down percent primarily due to the challenges associated with the us macroeconomic environment 
the us dollar continued to weaken against major currencies throughout fiscal the changes in currency exchange rates from fiscal affected the us dollar value of net sales within both primary operating segments 
we estimate these changes effectively increased our fiscal net sales within the north american furniture solutions segment by approximately million  driven largely by the us dollar canadian dollar average exchange rate during the current year 
currency exchange rate fluctuations within our non north american furniture solutions segment  increased net sales in fiscal by approximately million 
this was primarily driven by favorable movements in the us dollar british pound sterling and us dollar euro exchange rates as compared to fiscal it is important to note that period to period changes in currency exchange rates have a directionally similar impact on our international cost structures 
operating earnings within our non north american segment increased an estimated million in fiscal due to the aforementioned changes in currency exchange rates relative to fiscal the estimated impact on operating earnings of our north american business segment was an increase of approximately million 
gross margin fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent  a decline of basis points from the prior year level 
higher direct material costs from vendors coupled with significantly lower volumes contributed to this decreased gross margin performance year over year 
details relative to each component of gross margin follow 
direct material costs as a percentage of sales in the current year increased basis points 
the impact was front end loaded as raw material prices increased dramatically in the first half of the year  stabilized in the third quarter  and then declined substantially by the end of the year ending at approximately the same level they began the year 
our direct labor costs were higher by only basis points as a percentage of sales from prior year levels 
first and foremost  this performance is an indication of the speed with which action was taken to reduce costs in the face of a significant decrease to net sales 
this change in performance is also reflective of increased efficiency which was offset by the underlying increases in benefit costs  particularly medical benefits 
overhead costs decreased by million from fiscal our ability to react quickly to the sales decline  coupled with the variable nature of our business model  allowed us to actually improve overhead by basis points from the prior year 
this decrease in costs was a result of the restructuring actions which took place during the year and related primarily to headcount 
freight expenses  as a percentage of sales  were modestly lower compared to levels 
contributing to the reduction in freight expenses was a significant decrease in diesel fuel prices in the united states  as we moved through the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal our fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent  an improvement of basis points from the prior year level 
favorable direct material costs contributed to this increased gross margin performance year over year 
lower relative direct labor costs also boosted our margins while overhead expenses were slightly unfavorable 
details relative to each component of gross margin follow 
direct material costs as a percentage of sales in fiscal decreased basis points 
although a higher sales volume favorably affected the percentage  the effect of our fixed contracts for the procurement of certain raw materials also contributed to the improvement 
the majority of our fixed price contracts expired during the fourth quarter of the year and we began to see the impact of increased costs for our raw material inputs late in the year 
our direct labor costs were lower by basis points as a percentage of sales from prior year levels 
this reduction is primarily due to higher sales volume  and our continued manufacturing process improvements 
overhead costs increased in fiscal from prior year levels 
we recognized certain costs associated with the completion of a large project  and had an overall shift into low margin service related sales  which had the effect of increasing overhead costs by basis points in fiscal freight expenses  as a percentage of sales  were modestly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal levels 
contributing to the additional freight expenses was a significant increase in diesel prices in the united states 
we have continued to benefit from the efforts of our logistics teams to consolidate shipments  increase trailer utilization  and engage lower cost carriers  which together  served to mitigate the impact of increases in fuel costs 
pricing also served to partially offset the increases in fuel costs 
restructuring in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring program designed to align our cost structure with the reality of the current economic conditions 
these actions included the elimination of approximately  permanent and temporary positions across all segments 
these reductions were permanent for our salaried workforce  while our direct labor positions were eliminated until business levels return 
those positions that were permanently eliminated represented a variety of functional areas  and the individuals affected were offered one time termination benefits  including severance and outplacement services 
further actions were announced during the fourth quarter  which included a reduction in the work schedule for most employees in the us  and the suspension of the k match 
within the non north american segment further reductions in force and a change to the work schedule were implemented to achieve similar savings 
additionally  in the fourth quarter we announced the plans to shut down our imt facility in spring lake  michigan 
the operations within the plant will be moved to other owned facilities  and a small component of this work will be outsourced to suppliers 
we anticipate this shutdown will be completed over the next to months 
only the expenses related to the curtailment and special termination benefits of the pension plan have been recognized in fiscal the remaining costs are expected to be incurred over the course of the planned shutdown 
pre tax restructuring expenses for the aforementioned actions totaled million in fiscal  which are reflected separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
the related cash payments were million in fiscal the balance of the restructuring accrual at may  is million  and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet within other accrued liabilities 
operating expenses fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales  which compares to million  or percent of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
although there was a year over year decrease of million  we experienced a basis point increase to operating expenses as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal a charge of million for restructuring expenses as discussed above is included in fiscal there was a restructuring charge of million in fiscal the year over year dollar decline in expenses  excluding restructuring expense  was million or 
this is primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation and benefit costs as a result of the restructuring actions previously described  as well as a reduction in incentive compensation 
year over year changes in currency exchange rates had a deflationary impact on operating expenses associated with our international operations  as measured in us dollars 
we estimate these changes decreased our consolidated operating expenses in fiscal by approximately million relative to the prior year 
design and research costs included in total operating expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these expenses include royalty payments to the designers of our products 
we consider such royalty payments  which totaled million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  to be variable costs of the products being sold 
accordingly  we do not include them in research and development costs as discussed in note fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of net sales 
this compares to million or percent of net sales in fiscal although there was a year over year increase of million  we experienced an basis point reduction to operating expenses as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal a charge of million for restructuring expenses was included in fiscal there were no restructuring expenses in fiscal the dollar increase from fiscal to fiscal in expenses is primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefit costs  designer royalties  global selling expenses  program marketing costs  and the foreign exchange impact on operating expenses  partially offset by lower levels of charitable contributions  and savings from certain r d and product management programs 
leverage on higher sales levels in fiscal drove the percent of sales reduction in operating expenses 
incremental employee compensation and benefit costs in fiscal  which includes merit increases  stock based compensation  and health benefits were an estimated million higher than fiscal global selling costs and designer royalty expenses  both of which vary with net sales levels  were million and million higher  respectively  in fiscal than in fiscal in fiscal  we continued our pursuit of bringing new and innovative products to market  which drove incremental program marketing expenses of million compared to fiscal year over year changes in currency exchange rates had an inflationary impact on operating expenses associated with our international operations  as measured in us dollars 
we estimate these changes increased our consolidated operating expenses in fiscal by approximately million relative to fiscal partially offsetting these operating expense increases were charitable contributions that were million lower than fiscal and a combined savings from certain r d and product management programs of million 
design and research costs included in total operating expenses were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these expenses include royalty payments to the designers of our products 
we consider such royalty payments  which totaled million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  to be variable costs of the products being sold 
accordingly  we do not include them in research and development costs as discussed in note operating earnings fiscal operating earnings were million  which represents a decrease of percent from our fiscal level of million 
as a percentage of net sales  operating earnings in fiscal decreased to percent of net sales  a basis point decrease from the percent reported in the prior year 
the increase in restructuring expense led to basis points of the decline while the remainder is largely a result of the decline in volume 
in fiscal year  we reported operating earnings of million or percent of net sales 
other expenses and income net other expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year and million in fiscal the increase in expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally driven by additional interest expense of million in the current year associated with the additional senior subordinated notes 
net foreign currency transaction losses recorded in fiscal totaled million versus a million gain in fiscal the year over year increase in net other expenses of million between fiscal and fiscal was also as a result of higher interest expense related to the aforementioned debt issued in december of income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in fiscal versus percent in fiscal and in fiscal the effective rate in fiscal was below the statutory rate of  primarily due to the domestic us manufacturing tax incentive and the realization of foreign tax credits 
the effective rate in fiscal was below the statutory rate primarily due to the domestic us manufacturing tax incentive 
the effective rate in fiscal was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to million in tax credits for foreign taxes  other credits for research and development activities  and tax incentives for export sales and domestic manufacturing 
we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be between and percent 
for further information regarding income taxes  refer to note net earnings in fiscal we generated million of net earnings 
this compares to net earnings in fiscal and fiscal of million and million  respectively 
fiscal diluted earnings per share were 
earnings per diluted share in fiscal were and in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the table below presents certain key cash flow and capital highlights for the fiscal years indicated

refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
cash flow operating activities cash generated from operating activities in fiscal totaled million compared to million generated in the prior year 
this represents a decrease of million compared to fiscal changes in working capital balances resulted in a million use of cash in the current fiscal year compared to an million source of cash in the prior year 
the use of cash related to working capital balances in fiscal is primarily driven from decreased current liabilities of million over the prior year 
the reduction in liabilities is primarily related to reductions in accounts payable related to inventory  and accruals related to regular and incentive compensation 
the use of cash is partially offset by volume related declines in accounts receivables of million and inventories of million 
accounts receivable declined from the prior year  though it should be noted  this decline is not as substantial as the quarterly decline in sales 
however  this lag is not reflective of deterioration of the accounts receivable aging  but rather the timing of the sales within the fourth quarter and the customer type 
certain direct customers and geographic customers tend to have a longer pay cycle 
a relatively large percentage of the north american accounts receivable increase pertains to our mexican subsidiary which has the longest cash collection cycle in the north american segment 
the source of cash related to working capital balances in fiscal is primarily driven from increased current liabilities of million over the prior year  and to a lesser extent  lower inventory of million from prior year levels 
the increase in current liabilities is comprised of million in tax related accruals  million of increased trade accounts payable and million of other accruals 
these sources of cash are offset partially by increases in volume related accounts receivable of million due to increased sales inside and outside north america 
the working capital investment in fiscal was related to increases in inventory and accounts receivable  primarily due to the significant level of growth in our non north american furniture solutions segment 
a contributing factor to the working capital investment during fiscal relates to our business with the us federal government 
order activity with the federal government increased significantly during fiscal  particularly during the first and second quarters 
these sales generally require a longer cash collection cycle than do sales to independent contract furniture dealers 
accordingly  we experienced a related increase in accounts receivable 
inventory levels were also affected by this growth in federal government business  since we are generally required to hold product in inventory longer than with non government business 
this extended inventory holding period is necessary to be consistent with our revenue recognition policy for direct customer sales 
collections of accounts receivable remained strong throughout the year  and we believe our recorded accounts receivable valuation allowances at the end of fiscal are adequate to cover the risk of potential bad debts 
allowances for non collectible accounts receivable  as a percent of gross accounts receivable  totaled percent  percent  and percent at the end of fiscal years   and  respectively 
included in operating cash flows are cash contributions made to our employee pension and post retirement benefit plans which totaled million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
for further information regarding the company s pension and post retirement benefit plans  including information relative to the funded status of these plans  refer to note cash flow investing activities capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
outstanding commitments for future capital purchases at the end of fiscal were approximately million 
we expect capital spending in fiscal to be between million and million 
included in our fiscal investing activities  is a net cash outflow of million related to the completion of our acquisition of brandrud  and million related to our acquisition of certain elements of ruskin industries 
in fiscal  our investing activities included a net cash outflow of million related to the acquisition of brandrud 
in fiscal  our investing activities reflected a cash outflow of million related to the acquisition of a technology company 
this acquisition added enhanced functionality to the existing product portfolio for our convia subsidiary 
refer to note for further information related to these acquisitions 
our net marketable securities transactions for fiscal yielded a million source of cash 
this compares to a million source of cash in fiscal in fiscal  we were advanced million of cash against the value of company owned life insurance policies 
this is reflected as cash proceeds from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash flow financing activities fiscal year ended in millions  except share and per share data shares acquired    cost of shares acquired average cost per share acquired na na shares issued    average price per share issued cash dividends paid on january   the company entered into two agreements to purchase shares of its common stock from morgan stanley co 
inc  for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus fees  under an accelerated share repurchase asr program 
the company entered into these agreements as part of a repurchase program approved by its board of directors 
the number of shares purchased under the asr program was based on the volume weighted average price of the company s common stock during the term of the agreements 
on january  the company paid million in exchange for an initial delivery of million shares  representing of the shares that could have been purchased  based on the closing price of its common stock on january  an additional million shares were delivered during the remainder of fiscal an additional million shares were delivered on september   which completed the asr program 
the total number of shares repurchased under the asr was  at an average price of per share 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we announced a reduction in the cash dividend effective for first quarter of fiscal payment 
this change will reduce the cash dividend to per share versus a total quarterly cash dividend of per share that was paid through the third quarter of fiscal in fiscal we completed a debt financing transaction involving the issuance of million in senior unsecured private placement notes 
notes totaling million are due in january  and bear interest at a fixed annual coupon rate of percent 
the remaining million of these notes are due in january and bear interest at a fixed annual coupon rate of percent 
we used the million proceeds from the notes for an asr of our common stock 
refer to note for more information related to our long term debt 
in fiscal  we also completed a refinancing of our existing unsecured credit facility  increasing our borrowing capacity from million to million 
the new credit facility includes a million increase option  subject to customary conditions 
the facility may be used to refinance existing debt  provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes 
in fiscal  we also paid off million of debt on behalf of brandrud  our most recent acquisition 
as part of our decision to conserve cash we suspended share repurchases during fiscal in fiscal we repurchased shares totaling million 
the amount remaining under our share repurchase authorization at the end of fiscal totaled million 
interest bearing debt at the end of fiscal of million increased million from the end of fiscal  as compared to a million increase during the prior fiscal year 
the increase in fiscal is a result in the change in the fair value of our interest rate swap instrument  while the increase in fiscal related primarily to the issuance of million of private placement notes 
the only usage against our unsecured revolving credit facility at the end of fiscal years and represented outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million at each date 
the provisions of our private placement notes and unsecured credit facility require that we adhere to certain covenant restrictions and maintain certain performance ratios 
we were in compliance with all such restrictions and performance ratios during fiscal in fiscal  we received million related to the issuance of shares in connection with stock based benefit plans 
this compares to receiving million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal and we repatriated million and million of undistributed foreign earnings  respectively 
we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity to fund near term and future business operations and capital needs  subject to financing availability in the marketplace 
contingencies the company leases a facility in the uk under an agreement that expires in june under the terms of the lease  the company is required to perform the maintenance and repairs necessary to address the general dilapidation of the facility over the lease term 
the ultimate cost of this provision to the company is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the future use of the facility by the lessor and whether the company chooses and is permitted to renew the lease term 
the company has estimated the cost of these maintenance and repairs to be between and million  depending on the outcome of future plans and negotiations 
based on existing circumstances  it is estimated that these costs will most likely approximate million 
as a result  this amount has been recorded as a liability reflected under the caption other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of may  and may  the company has a lease obligation in the uk until may for a facility that it previously exited 
current market rates for comparable office space are lower than the rental payments owed under the lease agreement  as such  the company would remain liable to pay the difference 
as of may  and may  the future cost of this arrangement was estimated to be million and million respectively 
accordingly this amount is reflected within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of these dates 
the company is involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
it is the company s opinion that the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to may the fiscal years ended may   may   and june  each included weeks of operations 
this is the basis upon which weekly average data is presented 
contractual obligations contractual obligations associated with our ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods 
the following table summarizes the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments 
further information regarding debt obligations can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
likewise  further information related to operating leases can be found in note in millions payments due by fiscal year total thereafter long term debt estimated interest on debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations pension plan funding shareholder dividends other total amounts indicated do not include the recorded fair value of interest rate swap instruments 
estimated future interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations are based on interest rates as of may  actual cash outflows may differ significantly due to changes in underlying interest rates and timing of principal payments 
purchase obligations consist of non cancelable purchase orders and commitments for goods  services  and capital assets 
pension funding commitments are defined as the estimated minimum funding requirements to be made in the following month period 
such funding  if any  is not known beyond fiscal as of may   the total accumulated benefit obligation for our domestic and international employee pension benefit plans was million 
represents the recorded dividend payable as of may  future dividend payments are not considered contractual obligations until declared 
other contractual obligations primarily represent long term commitments related to deferred and supplemental employee compensation benefits  other post employment benefits  and minimum designer royalty payments 
total balance is reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet at may  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide certain guarantees to third parties under various arrangements in the form of product warranties  loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  lease guarantees  performance bonds  and indemnification provisions 
these arrangements are accounted for and disclosed in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities on occasion  we provide financial support to certain independent dealers in the form of term loans  lines of credit  and loan guarantees 
at may  and may   we were not considered the primary beneficiary of any such dealer relationships as defined by fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r and therefore  no entities were included as vies as of these dates 
the risks and rewards associated with our interests in these dealerships are primarily limited to our outstanding loans and guarantee amounts 
as of may  and may   our maximum exposure to potential losses related to outstanding loans to these dealerships totaled million and million  respectively 
information on our exposure related to outstanding loan guarantees provided to such entities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our goal is to report financial results clearly and understandably 
we follow us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
these policies and disclosures are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
revenue recognition as described in the executive overview  the majority of our products and services are sold through one of four channels independent contract furniture dealers and licensees  owned contract furniture dealers  direct to end customers  and independent retailers 
we recognize revenue on sales to independent dealers  licensees  and retailers once the product is shipped and title passes to the buyer 
when we sell product directly to the end customer or to owned dealers  we recognize revenue once the product and services are delivered and installation thereof is substantially complete 
amounts recorded as net sales generally include any freight charged to customers  with the related freight expenses recognized within cost of sales 
items such as discounts off list price  rebates  and other sale related marketing program expenses are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we record accruals for rebates and other marketing programs  which require us to make estimates about future customer buying patterns and market conditions 
customer sales that reach or fail to reach certain levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from our estimates 
receivable allowances we base our allowances for receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the current economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivable 
in addition  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable 
actual collections can differ from our historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
the accounts receivable allowance totaled million and million at may  and may   respectively 
as a percentage of gross accounts receivable  these allowances totaled percent and percent  respectively 
the year over year increase in the allowance percentage is primarily due to the perceived risk associated with the current economic conditions as opposed to an increase in specific customer issues 
goodwill the carrying value of our goodwill assets as of may  and may   totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase in goodwill balances relates primarily to our final payment for the acquisition of brandrud and also the acquisition of certain elements of ruskin industries 
we account for our goodwill assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
under this accounting guidance  we are required to perform an annual test on our goodwill assets by reporting unit to determine whether the asset values are impaired 
if impairment is determined  we are required to reduce the net carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair market value 
our impairment testing model is based partly on the present value of projected cash flows and the resulting residual value as well as a market based approach that considers recent market capitalization values 
in completing the test under this approach  we assume that one of the drivers of the value of a business today is the cash flows it will generate in the future 
we also assume that such future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
while these projected cash flows reflect our best estimate of future reporting unit performance  actual cash flows could differ significantly 
the results of this test  performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  indicated that our net goodwill asset values were not impaired 
we employed a market based approach in selecting the discount rates used in our analysis 
by this  we mean the discount rates selected represent market rates of return equal to what we believe a reasonable investor would expect to achieve on investments of similar size to our reporting units 
we believe the discount rates selected in our testing are conservative in that  in all cases  they exceed the estimated weighted average cost of capital for our business as a whole 
the results of the impairment test are sensitive to changes in discount rates  though the testing performed in fiscal would indicate that even a significant increase in the discount rate would not have changed the result 
warranty reserve we stand behind our products and keep our promises to customers 
from time to time  quality issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct problems with products or services 
we have established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these guarantees 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuation of such reserves is based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and may result in an adjustment to these reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories at the majority of our manufacturing operations are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  whereas inventories of certain other subsidiaries are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on prevailing circumstances and judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted in response to changing conditions 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
we also have foreign tax credits available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future tax due 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards and foreign tax credits are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we base this determination on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards and or foreign tax credits 
when information becomes available that raises doubts about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  we establish reserves for workers compensation and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on expected future claims for incurred losses 
we also establish reserves for health  prescription drugs  and dental benefit exposures based on historical claims information along with certain assumptions about future trends 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claims experience can vary 
we also maintain insurance coverage for certain risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions is the discount rate  interest crediting rate  and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we determine these assumptions as follows 
discount rate this assumption is established at the end of the fiscal year based on high quality corporate bond yields 
we utilize the services of an independent actuarial firm to analyze and recommend an appropriate rate 
for our domestic pension and other post retirement benefit plans  the actuary uses a cash flow matching technique  which compares the estimated future cash flows of the plan to a published discount curve showing the relationship between interest rates and duration for hypothetical zero coupon fixed income investments 
we set the discount rate for our international pension plan based on the yield level of a commonly used corporate bond index in that jurisdiction 
because the average duration of the bonds underlying this index is less than that of our international pension plan liabilities  the index yield is used as a reference point 
the final discount rate  which takes into consideration the index yield and the difference in comparative durations  is based on a recommendation from our independent actuarial consultant 
the discount rates selected for our domestic pension and post retirement benefit plans at the end of fiscal were consistent with those established at the end of fiscal with all other assumptions and values held constant  this would not result in a significant change in our pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses for our fiscal year  which began on june  the discount rate selected for our international pension plan at the end of the current year was higher than the rate established at the end of fiscal this change would result in a decrease in our international pension plan expense for fiscal if all other assumptions were held constant 
interest crediting rate we use this assumption in accounting for our primary domestic pension plan  which is a cash balance type plan 
the rate  which represents the annual rate of interest applied to each plan participant s account balance  is established at an assumed level  or spread  below the discount rate 
we base this methodology on the historical spread between the year us treasury and high quality corporate bond yields 
this relationship is examined annually to determine whether the methodology is still appropriate 
expected long term rate of return we base this assumption on our long term assumed rates of return for equities and fixed income securities  weighted by the allocation of the invested assets of the pension plan 
we consider risk factors specific to the various classes of investments and advice from independent actuaries in establishing this rate 
changes in the investment allocation of plan assets would impact this assumption 
a shift to a higher relative percentage of fixed income securities  for example  would result in a lower assumed rate 
while this assumption represents our long term market return expectation  actual asset returns can and do differ from year to year 
such differences give rise to actuarial gains and losses 
in years where actual market returns are lower than the assumed rate  an actuarial loss is generated 
conversely  an actuarial gain results when actual market returns exceed the assumed rate in a given year 
as of may   and may   the net actuarial loss associated with our employee pension and post retirement benefit plans totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
at both dates  the majority of this unrecognized loss was associated with lower than expected plan asset returns 
for purposes of determining annual net pension expense  we use a calculated method for determining the market related value of plan assets 
under this method  we recognize the change in fair value of plan assets systematically over a five year period 
accordingly  a portion of our net actuarial loss is deferred 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss is subject to amortization expense each year 
the amortization period used in determining this expense is the estimated remaining working life of active pension plan participants 
we currently estimate this period to be approximately years 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  the deferred net actuarial loss ie  the portion of the total net actuarial loss not subject to amortization was approximately million 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets and acquired business units for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment risk may be present 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
stock based compensation we view stock based compensation as a key component of total compensation for certain of our employees  non employee directors and officers 
we account for these programs  which include grants of restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance share units  employee stock purchases  and stock options  in accordance with sfas r 
under this guidance we recognize compensation expense related to each of these share based arrangements 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model in estimating the fair value of stock options issued in connection with our compensation program 
this pricing model requires the use of several input assumptions 
among the most significant of these assumptions are the expected volatility of our common stock price  and the expected timing of future stock option exercises 
expected volatility this represents a measure  expressed as a percentage  of the expected fluctuation in the market price of our common stock 
as a point of reference  a high volatility percentage would assume a wider expected range of market returns for a particular security 
all other assumptions held constant  this would yield a higher stock option valuation than a calculation using a lower measure of volatility 
in measuring the fair value of stock options issued during fiscal year  we utilized an expected volatility of percent 
expected term of options this assumption represents the expected length of time between the grant date of a stock option and the date at which it is exercised option life 
we assumed an average expected term of years in calculating the fair values of the majority of stock options issued during fiscal refer to note for further discussion on our stock based compensation plans 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we encounter matters that raise the potential for contingent liabilities 
in evaluating these matters for accounting treatment and disclosure  we are required to apply judgment in order to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred 
we are also required to measure  if possible  the dollar value of such liabilities in determining whether or not recognition in our financial statements is required 
this process involves the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to contingencies 
new accounting standards refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for information related to new accounting standards 
forward looking statements certain statements in this filing are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as defined under section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended 
such statements are based on management s belief  assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections about the office furniture industry  the economy and the company itself 
words like anticipates  believes  confident  estimates  expects  forecast  likely  plans  projects  and should  and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  expense  likelihood  and degree of occurrence 
these risks include  without limitation  employment and general economic conditions in the us and in our international markets  the increase in white collar employment  the willingness of customers to undertake capital expenditures  the types of products purchased by customers  the possibility of order cancellations or deferrals by customers  competitive pricing pressures  the availability and pricing of direct materials  our reliance on a limited number of suppliers  currency fluctuations  the ability to increase prices to absorb the additional costs of direct materials  the financial strength of our dealers  the financial strength of our customers  the mix of our products purchased by customers  our ability to attract and retain key executives and other qualified employees  our ability to continue to make product innovations  the strength of the intellectual property relating to our products  the success of newly introduced products  our ability to serve all of our markets  possible acquisitions  divestitures or alliances  the outcome of pending litigation or governmental audits or investigations  and other risks identified in this form k and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
therefore  actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what we express or forecast 
furthermore  herman miller  inc  takes no obligation to update  amend  or clarify forward looking statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures  markets  and sells its products throughout the world and  as a result  is subject to changing economic conditions  which could reduce the demand for its products 
direct material costs the company is exposed to risks arising from price changes for certain direct materials and assembly components used in its operations 
the largest such costs incurred by the company are for steel  plastics  textiles  wood particleboard  and aluminum components 
commodity prices were volatile during fiscal  resulting in sharp increases in costs for the first half of the year 
as the year progressed  prices receded back to approximately the same level that they began the year at 
the net impact of price changes during fiscal was an increase to our costs of million to million 
commodity prices were fairly flat during most of fiscal  resulting in increased costs of million to million  with most of this increase occurring in the fourth quarter 
during fiscal  rising commodities had a significant impact  adding an estimated million to million to the consolidated cost of sales for the full year 
steel and fuel price fluctuations have a direct impact on our input costs for many products 
during the past fiscal year both factors increased sharply  followed by a steady decline in the second half of the year 
during fiscal the impact of steel price increases was fairly flat due to price contracts with suppliers 
the company believes market prices for commodities in the near term may move lower but acknowledges that over time increases on its key direct materials and assembly components are likely 
consequently  it views the prospect of such increases as an outlook risk to the business 
foreign exchange risk the company manufactures its products in the united states  united kingdom  and china 
it also sources completed products and product components from outside the united states 
the company s completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world 
sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the company s reporting currency  the us dollar 
accordingly  production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured 
these currency exchange relationships can also affect the company s competitive positions within these markets 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the principal foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business are the british pound gbp  euro eur  canadian dollar  japanese yen  mexican peso  chinese renminbi cny  and brazilian real brl 
for the past three fiscal years the company has entered into forward currency instruments in order to offset exposure denominated in non functional currency 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  nine contracts in total were placed to offset various currency exposures 
to offset net asset exposure denominated in non functional currency  three forward contracts for million eur and three forward contracts for million usd were placed 
conversely  three contracts were placed to offset the company s net liability exposure denominated in non functional currency 
the contracts included million brl  million cny  and million of gbp 
at the end of fiscal  three contracts were placed to offset million eur for net asset exposure and two contracts for million usd were placed to offset net liability exposure 
similarly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company entered into three separate forward currency contracts in order to offset million eur of net asset exposure denominated in a non functional currency 
in all three years  the instruments were marked to market at the end of the period  with changes in fair value reflected in net earnings 
the fair value of the forward currency instruments was million for both years ended may  and may   and a negligible amount at june  for fiscal year  a net loss of million related to remeasuring all foreign currency transactions into the appropriate functional currency was included in net earnings 
for fiscal year  a net gain of million impacted net earnings  while the impact in fiscal was negligible 
additionally  the cumulative effect of translating the balance sheet and income statement accounts from the functional currency into the united states dollar increased the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total shareholders equity by million as of the end of fiscal conversely  the effect reduced the accumulated comprehensive loss component of total shareholder s equity by million  and million for the years ended may   and june   respectively 
interest rate risk the company maintains fixed rate debt for which changes in interest rates generally affect fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
as of the end of fiscal years and  the company held one interest rate swap agreement that effectively converts million of fixed rate debt securities to a variable rate 
as of the end of fiscal year  the company had two interest rate swaps that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis 
this debt is subject to changes in interest rates  which  if significant  could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the interest rate swap derivative instruments are held and used by the company as a tool for managing interest rate risk 
they are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these swap instruments are large financial institutions that the company believes are of high quality creditworthiness 
while the company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non performance by these counterparties  such losses are not anticipated 
the combined fair market value of effective interest rate swap instruments was million  million  and a negative million at may   may  and june   respectively 
the impact of these swap instruments on total interest expense was a reduction to interest expense of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and an addition to interest expense of million in fiscal all cash flows related to the company s interest rate swap instruments are denominated in us dollars 
for further information  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as of may   the weighted average interest rate on the company s variable rate debt was approximately percent 
based on the level of variable rate debt outstanding as of that date  a one percentage point increase in the weighted average interest rate would increase the company s annual pre tax interest expense by approximately million 
expected cash flows notional amounts over the next five years and thereafter related to debt instruments are as follows 
in millions thereafter total long term debt fixed rate wtd 
average interest rate derivative financial instruments related to debt interest rate swaps pay variable receive fixed pay interest rate at may  receive interest rate amount does not include the recorded fair value of the swap instruments  which totaled million at the end of fiscal
