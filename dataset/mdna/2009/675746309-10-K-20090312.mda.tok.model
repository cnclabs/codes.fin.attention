item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except share data the following discussion of our results of operations  consolidated financial condition and capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results for the years indicated 
we have provided a more complete discussion of operating results by line of business in the segments section beginning on page for the years ended december  change consolidated revenue operating expenses income from operations other expense  net income from continuing operations before taxes income tax expense benefit income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income segment income loss from continuing operations before taxes servicing loans and residuals asset management vehicles mortgage services financial services technology products corporate items and other compared to overall  our results reflect a modest increase in revenue combined with a decline in operating expenses that resulted in a improvement in operating income 
this increase in operating income is largely attributed to the servicing business due primarily to a decline in the amortization of servicing rights as a result of a decline in acquisitions and in the rate of amortization 
this operational improvement was tempered  however  by increased costs related to financing our servicing advances relative to the prior year  a decline in interest income on loans and residuals and unrealized losses on our investment grade auction rate securities that reflect liquidity risk 
despite being higher than  financing costs for servicing advances in declined in both the second and third quarters and in the fourth quarter were significantly lower than the fourth quarter of as a result of lower effective interest rates and our success in reducing advance balances 
total revenues increased by  or  in as compared to principally because of an increase in financial services revenue 
financial services external revenue increased by  or  because results include a full year of the operations of nci which we acquired on june  at the same time  however  external revenue of the mortgage services segment declined by  or  primarily because of the low volume of loan origination activity  the scaling back of our mortgage due diligence activities and the sale of gss canada s servicing rights during the second quarter of external revenue of the servicing segment declined by  or  primarily due to declines in float earnings and servicing fees  although these declines were largely offset by increases in late charges 
float earnings declined because of lower interest rates and lower average float balances which declined because of higher delinquencies and a smaller servicing portfolio 
late charges  which are not recognized as revenue until collected  have increased to normal levels as delinquency rates have become more stable 
total operating expenses were  or  lower in as compared to declines in operating expenses of the servicing and mortgage services segments were partly offset by an increase in operating expenses of the financial services segment 
operating expenses of the servicing segment declined primarily due to a  decline in the amortization of msrs and a  decline in servicing and origination expense 
slower projected prepayment speeds and higher projected delinquency rates used to compute amortization expense in reduced the rate of msr amortization because we expect to earn servicing income for a longer period of time 
in addition  the average balance of our investment in msrs has declined in as a result of fewer acquisitions 
operating expenses of the mortgage services segment declined largely because of the low volume of loan origination activity and the scaling back of our mortgage due diligence activities 
operating expenses of the financial services segment increased primarily because results include a full year of the operations of nci 
other expense  net  for was  as compared to  for  an unfavorable variance of  this variance is the result of several factors in the servicing segment  interest expense was  higher in because of an increase in the average balance of servicing advances and an increase in facility fees and interest rate spreads charged by the lenders 
in the loans and residuals segment  interest income on loans and residual securities declined by  in because of declines in assets 
in the amv segment  our consolidated share of the losses of osi and onl and affiliates for was  higher than the higher losses in reflect charges to reduce residual securities  loans and real estate to fair value 
in the technology products segment  our share of the losses of bms holdings was  in as compared to earnings of  in  a decline of  this decline is primarily the result of significant unrealized losses on auction rate securities 
unrealized gains on derivatives in the first quarter of were largely reversed in the second quarter of as a result of volatility in libor interest rates during those periods 
the derivatives held at bms holdings are intended to hedge against the effects of a decline in interest rates on bms holdings revenue earned through its deposit referral relationship 
in corporate items and other  we recorded  of realized and unrealized losses on our investment grade auction rate securities during in  we realized a loss of  on the early redemption of long term discounted certificates of deposit 
compared to our results for were characterized by higher income from operations that were offset by increased interest expense related to funding requirements for servicing advances and losses on residual securities and loans held for resale 
increases in unrealized losses on residual securities were  however  significantly offset by the gain that we realized from our sale of the uk residuals 
interest income decreased due to reduced investments in loans held for resale and residual securities  and we recognized a loss on our early redemption of long term discounted certificates of deposit 
total revenues increased by  or in principally because of the acquisition of nci which added  of revenues to the financial services segment  and an increase in mortgage services revenue 
external revenues of the mortgage services segment were  or  higher in as increases in fees from residential property valuations and title services offset a decline in mortgage due diligence fees 
total operating expenses were  or  higher in largely because of the acquisition of nci  which added  of operating expenses to the financial services segment in  offset by declines in operating expenses of the servicing and loans and residuals segments 
servicing operating expenses declined largely because of an  decline in the amortization of msrs 
slower prepayment speeds have reduced the rate of msr amortization because we expect to earn the servicing income over a longer period of time 
loans and residuals operating expenses were lower in largely due to our closing of the subprime loan origination operation and lower fees for professional services because of a sharp decline in securitizations of loans held for resale 
other expense  net increased by  in as a result of several significant factors in the servicing segment  total interest expense was  higher due to the costs of financing servicing advances and servicing rights because of the growth in the average balance of these assets and higher interest rates 
in the loans and residuals segment  we suffered a decline in interest income of  in due to a lower investment in loans held for resale and our sale of the uk residuals 
in addition  loans and residuals incurred unrealized losses of  in due principally to the write down during the fourth quarter of subprime subordinate and residual securities to their estimated market values reflecting significantly higher projected loss assumptions 
however  these unrealized losses were largely offset by a gain of  realized from our sale of the uk residuals in the second quarter 
in corporate items and other  we recorded a loss of  realized when an unanticipated liquidity need arose in the third quarter that caused us to redeem our zero coupon certificates of deposit prior to their maturity 
changes in financial condition total assets declined by  or  in this decrease was due to declines in all asset categories other than trading securities and cash advances and match funded advances declined by  because of declines in upb serviced and because we were able to stabilize the rate of loan delinquencies 
although the rate of amortization has slowed  mortgage servicing rights still declined by  largely because of the relatively small additions to our residential servicing portfolio 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we sold our commercial msrs which had a carrying value of  at december  investment in unconsolidated entities declined by  primarily due to  of distributions received from our asset management entities   from our share of the losses of these entities and  from our share of the losses of bms holdings 
loans held for resale declined by  due to foreclosures  charge offs  payoffs and declines in our estimated values 
trading securities increased by  and cash grew by  the increase in trading securities is primarily due to our investment in investment grade auction rate securities which had a fair value of  at december  this increase in auction rate securities was partially offset by the sale of our remaining investment in cmos that had a fair value of  at december  total liabilities declined by  or  in this decrease was the result of declines in all liability categories other than the investment line lines of credit and other secured borrowings declined by  principally because of a decline in borrowings under repurchase agreements and the payoff of the servicing borrowings under the senior secured credit agreements 
borrowings under repurchase agreements declined as a result of our sale of the cmos and because the proceeds from the sale of the notes that financed loans held for resale were used to repay a repurchase agreement that was secured by loans held for resale and real estate 
the decline in borrowings under the senior secured credit agreements occurred because of the sale of our commercial msrs in may and because in august  we exercised our option to convert our borrowings to a term note for the financing of msrs only 
advances serving as collateral under this facility were transferred to other match funded advance facilities  and borrowings secured by the advances were repaid 
servicer liabilities declined by  largely because of a decrease in the amount of borrower payments that have not yet been remitted to custodial accounts 
the decline in borrower payments is the result of slower repayments 
the investment line balance of  is secured by the auction rate securities that we acquired in at december   we had  of stockholders equity  an increase of  over december  that was primarily due to net income of  for  compensation related to employee share based awards and the expiration of stock based incentive compensation awards 
liquidity cash totaled  at december   an  increase as compared to december  due to retaining profits earned in coupled with limited acquisitions of mortgage servicing rights 
in addition  we raised  of cash by selling or financing non core assets  including our investments in cmos issued by fannie mae and freddie mac  loans held for resale  real estate and commercial msrs held by gss canada and by collecting long term receivables from the sale of affordable housing partnerships 
servicer liabilities  which represent cash collected from borrowers but not yet remitted to securitization trusts  declined by  from december  to december  servicer liabilities have a very short duration  as funds collected must be remitted to the trust in accordance with contractual obligation 
after increasing by  in the first quarter of  total advances decreased by   and  in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  for a net decrease of  or  for the year 
the improvement in advance levels is attributable to the success of our efforts to reduce growth in the delinquency rate  allowing advances to track the decline in upb 
management initiatives that we took to benefit loan investors  such as loan modifications and faster real estate sales  are the main factors helping to slow the growth in delinquencies 
during  we modified  delinquent loans and made  sales of foreclosed real estate 
our borrowings as of december  include  borrowed under the investment line term note that is used to finance the investment grade auction rate securities that we are carrying at a fair value of  the term note matures on june  we anticipate that we will be successful in negotiating an extension of the term note 
however  because of the failed auctions  the market for investment grade auction rate securities is not currently liquid 
in the event we need to liquidate our investment  we may not be able to do so without a loss of principal 
maximum borrowing under this note declined to of the face amount in december and declines to in march we intend to fund the reduction in the maximum borrowing rate using cash generated through operations 
through december   we have repaid  of investment line term note principal 
this amount includes proceeds of  from the redemption of certain securities and  from sales of securities during the second quarter 
in addition  the lender applied  of interest income from our investment in auction rate securities against the balance outstanding 
on september   we repaid in full the investment line revolving demand note that we had used to facilitate the generation of float income 
excluding the investment line  our borrowings have decreased by  in this decline primarily reflects reductions in borrowing by the servicing segment  loans and residuals segment  mortgage services segment and corporate items and other of    and  respectively 
the decline in borrowings of the servicing segment reflects a decline in advances and msrs 
the decline in borrowings of the loans and residuals segment is primarily the result of a decline in the balance of the loans pledged as collateral 
mortgage services borrowings declined as a result of our sale of the commercial msrs while corporate items and other borrowings declined as a result of our sale of the remaining cmos 
excluding the investment line  our total maximum borrowing capacity was  as of december   a decrease of  as compared to december  this decrease is primarily due to a  decrease in borrowing capacity of the servicing segment and a  decline in borrowing capacity of the loans and residuals segment 
the decrease in servicing borrowing capacity is primarily the result of the payoff of term notes of  and  under one match funded facility and a variable funding note of  under another match funded facility 
these notes had entered their amortization periods during the first and second quarters of in addition  in august  we repaid  of borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement when we exercised our option to convert that facility to a term note secured only by mortgage servicing rights 
these decreases were offset by an increase from  to  in the borrowing capacity under a match funded facility that we renewed in february and by our closing on a new  match funded facility in april at december   excluding the investment line   of our total maximum borrowing capacity remained unused  including  attributed to the servicing business 
our lowest unused borrowing capacity for any day during the month of december was approximately  of the unused borrowing capacity  none was readily available because we had no additional assets pledged as collateral but not drawn under our facilities 
we have some unpledged advances under certain pooling and servicing agreements that previously had been pledged to the senior secured credit agreement 
these advances are awaiting pledging to other advance facilities and will generate additional cash when this takes place 
the current challenges facing the financial markets have made it difficult to renew or increase advance financing under terms as favorable as those of our current facilities 
in december  we secured a one year renewal of a  variable funding note under one of our match funded advance facilities the start of the amortization period for this note is december in january  we also negotiated an early renewal of a  facility 
the start of the amortization period for this note is january with the continuing decline of our advance balances and the success of our other liquidity initiatives  we believe that we will have sufficient borrowing capacity to finance advances on our current servicing portfolio through the remainder of even if we are unable to negotiate any new facilities or any renewals or increases of existing facilities 
we will endeavor to retain sufficient cash to repay any advances in excess of our borrowing capacity if such borrowing capacity declines under this worst case scenario for financing 
another reason that we will retain cash is to cover possible additional principal repayments on our msr term note in the event that the collateral value determined by a third party appraiser declines faster than the scheduled amortization of this note 
during these challenging times in the financial markets  we have given careful consideration to counterparty risk 
our advance facilities revolve  and in a typical monthly cycle  we repay up to one third of the borrowings from collections 
during the remittance cycle  which starts in the middle of each month  we must depend on our lenders to provide us with the cash that is required to make remittances to the servicing investors 
however  this is possible only when new advances represent eligible collateral under our advance facilities  and we can borrow additional funds against this collateral 
some of the financial institutions lending to us have experienced significant financial losses and have been the subject of investor concern 
several of these lenders are undergoing restructuring activities  including merging with stronger institutions or raising additional capital  either as part of or outside of the various government rescue plans that have been announced 
these actions appear to have succeeded in stabilizing our largest lenders and thereby reducing our counterparty risk  but we continue to monitor closely the financial condition of our lenders 
during  financing costs have come down from the historic highs in the latter part of that were driven largely by the increase in our advance borrowings 
declining advances and lower interest rates in have offset higher facility costs and interest rate spreads and allowed the effective interest rates that we pay to return to levels experienced in and prior years 
the rate paid on the average balance of our debt outstanding under our match funded facilities and our lines of credit and other secured borrowings was in this rate rose to in but declined to in critical accounting policies our ability to measure and report our operating results and financial position is heavily influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of risks in the marketplace or other future events 
our critical accounting policies are those that relate to the estimation and measurement of these risks 
because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties  an understanding of these policies is fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in detail in note of our consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference 
the following is a summary of our more subjective and complex accounting policies as they relate to our overall business strategy 
valuation and amortization of residential mortgage servicing rights our most significant business is our servicing business 
inherent in this business is the acquisition of msrs  an intangible asset representing the value of the right to service the loans in a portfolio 
as of december   we held residential msrs with a carrying value of  and an estimated fair value of  the most critical accounting policy for this business is the methodology we use to value and amortize msrs 
application of this methodology requires the development of a number of estimates  including anticipated amortization  and periodic re evaluation of these estimates 
we estimate the fair value of our msrs based on the results of our internal valuation 
our internal valuation calculates the present value of estimated future cash flows utilizing external assumptions that we believe are used by market participants 
in addition  we periodically review third party valuations of certain of our msrs to assess the reasonableness of our valuation assumptions and the resulting fair value estimates 
the most significant assumptions used in our internal valuation are the expected speed at which mortgages prepay and expected delinquencies  both of which we derive from our historical experience and available market data 
other assumptions used in our internal valuation include cost of servicing compensating interest expense discount rate interest rate used for computing the cost of servicing advances interest rate used for computing float earnings the significant cash inflows considered in estimating future cash flows include servicing fees  late fees  prepayment penalties  float earnings and other ancillary fees 
significant cash outflows include the cost of servicing  the cost of making servicing advances and compensating interest payments 
we base our strata on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
our strata include subprime alt a high loan to value re performing special servicing other at december   we had msrs relating to the subprime  alt a and high loan to value strata 
the following table provides the range of prepayment speed and delinquency assumptions expressed as a percentage by strata projected over the five year period beginning december  prepayment speed delinquency subprime alt a high loan to value while we internally develop the discount rate in light of prevailing market conditions  we base the interest rate for the cost of financing advances  the interest rate for float earnings and the cost of servicing on external market based assumptions 
as of december   these assumptions were as follows discount rate of interest rate of for the cost of financing advances interest rate of for float earnings assumptions regarding the cost of servicing represent industry averages  vary by strata and range from a low of per year for a performing alt a loan to a high of per year for a loan in foreclosure 
changes in these assumptions are generally expected to affect our results of operations as summarized below increases in prepayment speeds generally reduce the value of our msrs as the underlying loans prepay faster which causes accelerated msr amortization  higher compensating interest payments and lower overall servicing fees  partially offset by a lower overall cost of servicing  increased float balances on higher float earnings and lower interest expense on decreased servicing advance balances 
increases in delinquencies generally reduce the value of our msrs as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period  and the amount of servicing advances and related interest expense also increase 
increases in the discount rate reduce the value of our msrs due to the lower overall net present value of the net cash flows 
increases in interest rate assumptions for the cost of servicing advances will increase interest expense although this effect is partially offset because rate increases will also increase the amount of float earnings we recognize 
we periodically perform an impairment analysis based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value of msrs after grouping the underlying loans we service into the applicable strata 
the risk factors used to assign loans to strata include the credit score fico of the borrower  the loan to value ratio and the default risk 
we amortize msrs over the period of estimated net servicing income based on our projections of the amount and timing of future cash flows 
we determine these projections using the same assumptions that we use in our internal valuation of msrs 
the amount and timing of servicing asset amortization is adjusted periodically based on actual results and updated projections 
in and  we experienced lower mortgage prepayment speeds and higher delinquency rates which resulted in a slower rate of amortization 
trading securities and loans held for resale we currently account for our investment grade  residual and subordinate securities as trading securities at fair value 
we report changes in fair value as a component of gain loss on trading securities in the period of change 
we adjust our investment grade securities for which external marks are available to fair value based on third party dealer quotations 
our investment grade securities typically represent short term investments that trade frequently in active markets and therefore we are able to evaluate the quotations we receive against observable market activity and subsequent trades or maturities 
we base our estimate of the fair value of the auction rate securities on a combination of actual sales and redemptions of the auction rate securities that we hold and a discounted cash flow analysis 
key assumptions that we use in our estimate of expected future cash flows include the expected term  illiquidity premium and discount rate 
we use an expected term of months based on our best estimate of market participants expectations of future successful auctions or other solutions to the illiquidity that characterizes the market 
the discount rates that we use range from to  and we assumed illiquidity premiums that range between and 
the discount rates and illiquidity premiums are consistent with prevailing rates for similar securities 
other significant assumptions that we considered in our analysis included the credit risk profiles of the issuers  the impact on the issuers of the increased debt service costs associated with the payment of penalty interest rates and the collateralization of the securitization trusts 
as of december   investment grade auction rate securities had a fair value of  net of unrealized losses of  we believe that the fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements is considerably less than the amounts we ultimately expect to realize 
recent government initiatives may resolve the liquidity constraints for these securities  resulting in an economic value higher than the estimated fair market value 
our subordinate and residual securities are not actively traded and  therefore  market quotations are not available 
we estimate fair value using an industry accepted discounted cash flow model which is calibrated for trading activity whenever possible 
we estimate expected future cash flows using our best estimate of key assumptions such as discount  delinquency and cumulative loss rates as well as prepayment speeds associated with the loans underlying mortgage backed securities 
discount rates for the subordinate and residual securities range from to and are determined based upon an assessment of prevailing market conditions and prices for similar assets 
we project the delinquency  loss and prepayment assumptions based on a comparison of actual historical performance curves  adjusted for prevailing market conditions 
peak delinquency assumptions range from to  and loss assumptions range from to 
average prepayment assumptions range from to 
estimated fair value represents management s best estimate of an amount that could ultimately be realized in an actual sale transaction 
residual and subordinate securities had a fair value of  at december   net of unrealized losses of  we classify loans that we do not intend to hold to maturity as loans held for resale and report them at the lower of cost or fair value 
we account for the excess of cost over fair value as a valuation allowance with changes in the valuation allowance included in gain loss on loans held for resale  net  in the period in which the change occurs 
loans for which we have entered into an agreement to sell to an investor at a set price are valued at the commitment price 
for uncommitted loans  we estimate fair value based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
we base the fair value of our performing loans upon the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk of the estimated cash flows 
significant assumptions include collateral and loan characteristics  prevailing market conditions and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
the fair value of our non performing loans is estimated based upon the underlying collateral to the loan and the estimated period and cost of disposition 
we defer loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs until we sell the loans 
we consider these fees and costs in the carrying value of the loans when determining a valuation allowance 
as of december   loans held for resale of  were net of valuation allowances of  goodwill and intangibles as a result of our acquisition of nci in  we acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of  goodwill represents the cost of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of its net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 
at december   the balance of goodwill was  of which  relates to the acquisition of nci and is included in our financial services segment and  relates to our acquisition of the company that developed the predecessor to realtrans and is included in our technology products segment 
goodwill 
we test the goodwill in each of our operating segments  which are components one level below our six business segments  for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows based on a two step impairment test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net carrying value including goodwill 
we derive the fair value of each of our operating segments based on valuation techniques that we believe market participants would use for each segment discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
our goodwill impairment test involves the making of estimates and the exercise of management judgment 
from time to time  we may obtain assistance from third parties in our evaluation 
the discounted cash flow valuation methodology uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual future cash flows achieved 
in projecting our cash flows  we used projected growth rates of to 
for the discount rate  we used  which reflected our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization 
fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting units over the next five years and terminal value at the end of those five years 
during the fourth quarters of   and  we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests and determined that there was no goodwill impairment 
however  in the second quarter of  we did record an impairment of the remaining  of goodwill related to bok  which is held for sale  based on offers that we had received that were less than carrying value 
in addition  we recorded a  reduction of the goodwill in our financial services segment during prior to our acquisition of nci in  nci made a taxable acquisition which created tax deductible goodwill that amortizes over time 
when we acquired nci in  we recorded a lesser amount of goodwill for financial reporting purposes than what had previously been recorded at nci for tax purposes 
this difference between the amount of goodwill recorded for financial reporting purposes and the amount recorded for taxes is amortized in our consolidated financial statements 
in  the amortization resulted in a  reduction of goodwill on our balance sheet and a corresponding increase in current and deferred taxes in corporate items and other 
we will continue to amortize the remaining difference to reducing first  goodwill and then  noncurrent intangible assets to zero 
finally  we will amortize any remaining difference annually as a reduction to income tax expense 
identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated lives in accordance with sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable 
the balance of intangibles at december  was  these intangibles are amortizing and relate to trademarks and customer lists we acquired in connection with our acquisition of nci 
these circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate or operating or cash flow losses and projections of continuing losses 
an impairment loss  generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
during  we did not identify any indicators of impairment for our nci customer relationship and trade name intangibles 
however  we did record an impairment in the second quarter of the remaining  of non amortizing license intangibles related to bok 
deferred tax assets the use of estimates and the application of judgment is involved in the determination of our overall tax provision and the evaluation of the realizability of our gross deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of  and a corresponding valuation allowance of  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  during  we reversed  of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets in order to increase the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance in  we primarily based our determination on the cumulative taxable earnings in recent periods  the positive outlook for future earnings and the disposal of nearly all of our non core assets 
we established our valuation allowance during the period through our evaluation of the need to maintain a valuation allowance takes into consideration evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent earnings history  current tax position and estimates of future taxable income 
the tax character ordinary versus capital and the carry forward and carry back periods of certain tax attributes eg  capital losses and tax credits are also considered 
judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence related to realizability of the deferred tax assets 
we base the determination of the amount of the aggregate valuation allowance on scenario analyses of the projected results of operations by line of business resulting in a range of potential valuation allowances within which a final amount is determined 
we assess the amount of the valuation allowance each quarter 
as further evidence of the realizability of our deferred tax assets we disposed of msrs with a carrying value of in february  resulting in a taxable gain 
litigation we continuously monitor the status of our legal matters 
we obtain advice from external legal counsel in our periodic assessment of legal matters for potential loss accrual and disclosure 
we make a determination of the amount of the reserves required in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we establish reserves for settlements  judgments on appeal and filed and or threatened claims for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
servicing servicing continues to be our most profitable segment  despite absorbing the negative impact  first  of higher delinquencies and lower float balances that we have experienced because of current economic conditions and  second  of increased interest expense that resulted from our need to finance higher servicing advance balances 
lower amortization of msrs due to higher projected delinquencies and declines in both projected prepayment speeds and the average balance of msrs offset these negative effects 
as a result  income from operations improved by  or in as compared to delinquencies were relatively stable and advances declined during this is due to both a decline in the upb of loans that we service for others and to our success in stabilizing the delinquency rate of these loans 
management initiatives that are designed to maximize the return to the loan investors resulted in increased loan modifications and faster sales of foreclosed real estate and were the primary factor in stabilizing delinquencies 
we expect delinquency rates to remain flat in which will lead to further reductions in advances as our seasoned portfolio matures 
the number of non performing loans serviced declined by  loans in  declining in each of the first three quarters of the year 
however  non performing loans rose by  in the fourth quarter 
the increase in the fourth quarter is attributable to seasonal factors including fewer collection days in november and december because of the effect of holidays 
while the number of non performing loans declined  the upb of non performing loans as a percentage of the portfolio serviced increased during to at december  from at december  servicing advances began declining in the second quarter of and declined by for the year 
interest expense on borrowings of the servicing segment was higher for the year in than but declined by in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of servicing and subservicing fees  excluding float earnings and ancillary income  declined by in as compared to due to the decline in upb serviced 
prepayment speed averaged in as compared to in prepayment speed increased in due to a larger number of real estate sales 
such involuntary liquidations accounted for approximately of prepayments during as compared to approximately for we expect prepayment speed to decline in the future as the number of loans in foreclosure and properties awaiting liquidation decrease 
another factor expected to contribute to a decline in prepayment speed is an increase in the fixed rate portion of our loan portfolio as arm loans continue to prepay at a faster rate and become a smaller portion of total loans

msr runoff primarily results from principal repayments on loans and sales of real estate 
the market for the acquisition of servicing rights to newly originated subprime mortgage loans slowed significantly in the latter part of since then  servicing transactions have consisted mostly of trades of seasoned portfolios 
because of the turmoil in the credit markets  we have been cautious in our acquisition of msrs  and we did not make any significant additions to our residential servicing portfolio during in the longer term  our continued growth and success in the servicing business is in part dependent on our ability to acquire msrs at an appropriate price 
as a result  we will continue to selectively pursue opportunities for additional servicing and subservicing business 
we are optimistic about our prospects for maintaining our scale and growing the servicing business over time 
in addition to acting as servicer and subservicer  we have entered into backup servicing agreements with two large financial institutions 
as backup servicer  we have agreed to accept the servicing responsibilities on up to  of mortgage loans in the event that the primary servicer is terminated 
as back up servicer  we are entitled to all servicing compensation to which the terminated servicer would have been entitled 
we are not required to fund the delinquency or servicer advance obligations or the compensating interest obligations on the loans that we accept 
as of december   we were not servicing any loans under these agreements

when the borrower does not make a full principal and interest payment  we are required under most servicing agreements to advance funds to the investment trust 
however  we are obligated to advance funds only to the extent that we believe that the advances are recoverable from loan proceeds 
most of our advances have the highest standing for reimbursement from payments  repayments and liquidation proceeds at the loan level 
in addition  for any advances that are not covered by loan proceeds  the large majority of our pooling and servicing agreements provide for reimbursement at the pool level  using collections on other loans 
we are also required to pay property taxes and insurance premiums  to process foreclosures and to advance funds to maintain  repair and market real estate properties on behalf of investors  and these advances are accorded the same high priority for repayment as principal and interest advances 
we generally recover our advances in full when foreclosed properties are sold  and this is also generally true when we modify a loan 
during  the combined balance of advances and match funded advances decreased by  or  due to a decline in upb serviced and the relative stabilization of the rate of loan delinquencies 
match funded advances on loans serviced for others result from our transfers of residential loan servicing advances to spes in exchange for cash 
we make these transfers under the terms of four advance facility agreements 
we either retain control of the advances  or the advances are transferred to trusts that are not qspes under sfas no 
as a result  we include the spes in our consolidated financial statements 
the match funded advances are owned by the spes and are not available to satisfy general claims of our creditors 
conversely  the holders of the debt issued by the spes generally can look only to the assets of the issuer for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against ocn 
however  ols has guaranteed the payment of the obligations of the issuer under the match funded facility that we executed in april the maximum amount payable under the guarantee is limited to of the notes outstanding at the end of the facility s revolving period in april see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of the composition of advances and match funded advances 
mortgage servicing rights 
the unamortized balance of residential msrs is primarily related to subprime residential loans 
residential msrs declined by  during  primarily due to amortization expense of  although the rate of amortization has slowed  the msr balance declined largely because we did not make any significant acquisitions of msrs during our purchases of residential msrs during totaled  this compares to  and  in and  respectively 
in addition  we established a valuation allowance of  in on servicing rights assigned to the high loan to value stratum because the carrying value exceeded fair value due to higher industry averages for delinquencies on loans in the second lien position 
this charge is reported as a component of servicing and origination expenses 
net of the valuation allowance  the carrying value of this stratum was zero at december  we may reduce this valuation allowance in the future if the fair value of the msrs increases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on mortgage servicing rights 
match funded liabilities 
match funded liabilities are obligations secured by the related match funded assets and are repaid through the cash proceeds arising from those assets 
we account for and report match funded liabilities as secured borrowings with pledges of collateral 
all of our match funded liabilities are secured by advances on loans serviced for others 
the  decline in match funded liabilities during primarily resulted from the  reduction in the combined balance of advances and match funded advances  offset by the transfer of borrowings from our senior secured credit agreement and an increase in the average effective advance rate under our match funded lending agreements 
a  term note  a  term note and a  variable funding note entered their amortization periods in and were paid in full by september  these notes had a combined outstanding balance of  at december  these repayments had little effect on the balance of our match funded liabilities because in one instance the borrowing was shifted to another note with spare capacity that was secured by the same collateral pool and in the other instance the borrowing was moved to a new  advance facility that closed in april at december   of match funded advances were funded through borrowings as compared to at december  unused borrowing capacity under match funded liabilities increased from  at december  to  at december  our maximum borrowing capacity under match funded liabilities was  at december  as compared to  at december   a decrease of  the decrease in borrowing capacity results from the three notes which had a combined borrowing capacity of  that entered their amortization periods  offset by the addition of  of new borrowing capacity by increasing from  to  the maximum borrowing amount under one facility that we renewed in february and adding the new  facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the terms and balances of our match funded liabilities 
lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
we exercised our option contained in the senior secured credit agreement for an month term note to finance msrs and transferred the advance collateral to existing match funded facilities 
therefore  we did not renew the facility prior to its maturity in august as a result  the amount outstanding under lines of credit and other secured borrowings declined by  during at december   the maximum borrowing capacity under the term note was  a  decline compared to the borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit agreement at december  there was no unused borrowing capacity under the term note at december  as compared to  of unused borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit agreement at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the terms and balances of our lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
servicer liabilities 
servicer liabilities represent amounts we have collected  primarily from residential borrowers whose loans we service  which we will deposit in custodial accounts  pay directly to an investment trust or refund to borrowers 
we exclude custodial accounts from our balance sheet 
servicer liabilities declined by  during largely due to a  decline in the amount of borrower payments due to the custodial accounts 
this decline reflects the impact of low collection volume primarily resulting from slower voluntary prepayments and a smaller servicing portfolio

the principal components of servicing and subservicing fees are residential loan servicing and subservicing late charges custodial accounts float earnings loan collection fees other commercial us residential loan servicing and subservicing fees declined by in as compared to this decline is primarily due to a decline in the average balance of loans serviced and higher delinquencies  offset in part by an increase in collected servicing fees 
the average balance of loans serviced during declined primarily because of a decline in portfolio acquisitions 
additions to the portfolio in and were  and  respectively 
loan servicing and subservicing fees for increased by over primarily due to a increase in the average balance of loans serviced 
the increase in the average balance of loans serviced during is the result of portfolio acquisitions coupled with reduced run off of the existing portfolio due to slower prepayment speeds 
the growth in revenue in attributed to the higher average balance of loans serviced was partially offset by the impact of rising delinquencies 
we collect servicing fees  generally expressed as a percent of the upb from the borrowers payments and from reimbursements from the securitization trusts 
we recognize servicing fees as revenue when earned which is generally upon collection of borrower payments 
delinquencies affect the timing of servicing fee revenue recognition but not the ultimate collection of the fees because servicing fees generally have a higher standing than advances which are satisfied before any interest or principal is paid by the securitization trust on the bonds 
we estimate that during the balance of uncollected and unrecognized servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments increased by as compared to an increase of  during as of december   we estimate that the balance of uncollected delinquent servicing fees that we had not yet recognized as revenue was  compared to  as of december  the increase in late charges for reflects higher delinquencies and collections of previously assessed late charges primarily on loans that have returned to performing status 
the increase in late charges lags the increase in delinquencies because late charges are not earned and therefore not recognized as revenue until they are collected 
late charges were slightly lower in as compared in spite of the fact that delinquencies had risen and the average balance of the loan servicing portfolio grew during this is because late charges are not recognized as revenue until they are collected 
the decline in float earnings in and reflects a decline in both the average float balance and the yield 
the decline in the average balance of these accounts in is the result of a decline in the servicing portfolio and a reduction in collections related to loan payoffs 
the decline in the annualized yield is due to the decline in short term interest rates 
the decline in the average balance of these accounts in resulted from a decline in mortgage prepayment speeds and an increase in delinquencies  offset in part by the growth in the servicing portfolio 
the underlying servicing agreements restrict the investment of float balances to certain types of instruments 
we are responsible for any losses incurred on the investment of these funds 
the following table summarizes information regarding float earnings for the years ended december average custodial account balances float earnings yield for  float earnings included  of income from auction rate securities 
as disclosed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  through september   we generated float earnings through the investment line revolving demand note 
under this agreement  we borrowed funds each month at a nominal interest rate and invested those funds in certain permitted investments 
funds provided by the investment line were available only for investment purposes and were not available for general operating purposes 
the amount borrowed was based on projected average custodial balances for the month 
upon expiration of the revolving demand note on september   we repaid the line in full using the proceeds from the liquidation of the investments under this line 
no actual custodial funds were invested via this line since we invested only the funds borrowed through the investment line revolving demand note 
the custodial funds remain on deposit in bank accounts that meet the requirements of each securitization trust 
process management fees 
process management fees are primarily comprised of revenues associated with foreclosed residential real estate marketing activities 
these revenues were   and  for  and  respectively 
the increase in was due to higher sales volume that is in part attributed to our efforts to more effectively market and price foreclosed residential real estate in the servicing portfolio 
process management fees for and also included  and  respectively  of loan refinancing fees earned through a program under which we originated loans in response to requests from borrowers to refinance their mortgages 
we discontinued this program in the third quarter of compensation and benefits expense 
the increase in compensation and benefits expense in is largely due to an increase in average employment in the us coupled with an increase in the proportion of higher paid loss mitigation staff to total servicing staff in the us the increase in loss mitigation staff was in response to the increase in non performing loans 
the average number of employees in the us grew by in as compared to  principally because of increases in average loss mitigation staff  which grew by 
in india  the average servicing staff grew by less than in  but average loss mitigation staff grew by 
the change in the composition of the us loss mitigation staff resulted in an increase in loss mitigation compensation and benefits of  or 
as a result  total servicing compensation and benefits grew by  or  in despite an increase of only in average employment 
beginning in may  we began to reduce servicing staff as the upb of loans serviced declined  however  through much of  us staff continued to represent a higher proportion of the servicing workforce than it did in for  average employment in india grew by as compared to principally because of a increase in staffing during the course of in support of servicing portfolio growth 
we also began increasing the number of loss mitigation staff in the us during average employment in the servicing segment for the years ended december india united states other amortization of servicing rights 
amortization expense declined by in as compared to  and by in as compared to these declines occurred because of a reduction in the rate of amortization and a decline in the acquisition of msrs 
we amortize mortgage servicing rights in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
slower projected mortgage prepayment speeds and higher projected delinquencies have reduced the rate of amortization as we expect to earn the servicing income over a longer period of time 
average projected prepayment speeds used to compute amortization expense were and for and  respectively 
average projected delinquency rates past due days or more used to compute amortization expense were and for and  respectively 
servicing and origination expense 
the principal components of servicing and origination expense are impairment of msrs compensating interest satisfaction expense other compensating interest on loan payoffs and satisfaction fees both declined in primarily as a result of the decline in the servicing portfolio and a decline in voluntary loan prepayments 
other servicer expenses also declined in as a result of system automation and process improvements 
the decline in compensating interest expense in as compared to primarily reflects slower prepayment speeds 
other servicer expense for included  of expenses related to amounts due from borrowers that were subsequently deemed uncollectible 
these expenses primarily related to serviced loans that paid off during technology and communication expense 
the increase in technology and communication expense in is largely due to higher technology support charges from the technology products segment 
the higher charges are principally due to the implementation of a market based rate card in the second quarter of that replaced the cost based method 
the decline in technology and communication expense in as compared to reflects lower technology support charges and lower document imaging costs as a result of a decline in servicing acquisition volume 
professional services expense 
professional services are primarily comprised of legal fees which totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
legal fees for were  lower than primarily because in we recorded a provision of  to increase litigation accruals related to ongoing cases and in  we recorded the reversal of excess accruals on settled cases 
we recorded no provisions in or to increase litigation accruals 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses primarily consist of overhead allocations and other charges from various other segments 
these charges totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense increased in both and principally because of increased financing costs associated with our residential servicing advances due to the growth in our investment in these assets and an increase in facility fees and interest rates spreads charged by the lenders 
the average combined balance of advances and match funded advances was higher in than  and higher in than average borrowings were  or higher in than in borrowings for were  or higher on average than in offsetting the effect of the increase in average balances outstanding during  the average rate on these borrowings decreased by basis points  or  as compared to the majority of our credit facilities bear interest at rates that are adjusted regularly based on month libor 
the average of month libor was  and during  and  respectively 
average rates for have not declined in proportion to the decline in libor principally because of the higher spread over libor charged on the new match funded facilities added in and and because of higher facility fees charged by the lenders 
interest expense includes amortization of facility costs of   and  during  and  respectively 
amortization of facility costs in included the second quarter write off of  of deferred costs related to a match funded facility that we decided not to expand or renew 
loans and residuals the pre tax loss for increased by  as compared to largely due to a decline of  in net interest income on subordinate and residual securities and loans held for resale

the  decrease in subordinate and residual securities during was primarily due to a decline in fair value that reflects conditions in the subprime mortgage market 
net unrealized losses on subordinate and residual trading securities were  during our subordinate and residual securities are not actively traded  and therefore  market quotations are not available 
we estimate fair value using an industry accepted discounted cash flow model that is calibrated for trading activity wherever possible 
we estimate fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows using our best estimate of key assumptions that market participants would use such as discount  delinquency and cumulative loss rates as well as prepayment speeds associated with the loans underlying mortgage backed securities 
the estimated fair value of our residuals and subordinate trading securities is significantly influenced by the loss assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model 
our loss assumptions range between and 
subordinate and residual securities do not have a contractual maturity but are paid down over time as cash distributions are received

the following table sets forth the unrealized and realized gains losses on subprime subordinate and residual mortgage backed securities unrealized losses  net realized gains  net we recognized the majority of the unrealized losses in the fourth quarter as a result of a significant increase in projected loss assumptions on residential mortgage backed securities 
these projections were released by standard poor s rating service on february  realized gains in are primarily comprised of a  gain from our sale of the uk residuals during the second quarter 
loss on loans held for resale  net 
the components of loss on loans held for resale  net  are valuation adjustments and charge offs gain on sales and securitizations of loans valuation losses represent charges that we recorded to reduce loans held for resale to their fair values which have declined due to the deteriorating conditions in the subprime mortgage market 
in addition to these valuation adjustments  we have recorded charge offs on resolved loans 
the upb of nonperforming loans as a percentage of total upb declined from at december  to at december  in and  the gain on sales and securitizations of loans consists principally of the recovery of premiums on loans repurchased by the original seller and the reversal of the majority of a reserve that we established in to provide for a contingent repurchase obligation on sold loans

mortgage services income from operations declined by  or in as compared to  primarily because of lower revenues as a result of declining loan origination volumes 
we have somewhat offset the effect of declining origination volumes by expanding our services to focus on supporting delinquent and defaulted loans 
in addition  servicing revenues declined as a result of our sale of servicing rights owned by gss canada

goodwill and intangibles arising from the acquisition of nci are as follows goodwill intangibles accumulated amortization intangibles  net prior to our acquisition of nci in  nci made a taxable acquisition which created tax deductible goodwill that amortizes over time 
when we acquired nci in  we recorded a lesser amount of goodwill for financial reporting purposes than what had previously been recorded at nci for tax purposes 
this difference between the amount of goodwill recorded for financial reporting purposes and the amount recorded for taxes is amortized in our consolidated financial statements 
in  the amortization resulted in a  reduction of goodwill on our balance sheet and a corresponding increase in current and deferred taxes in corporate items and other 
we will continue to amortize the remaining difference to reducing first  goodwill and then  noncurrent intangible assets to zero 
finally  we will amortize any remaining difference annually as a reduction to income tax expense 
intangibles consist primarily of customer lists that we are amortizing over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
lines of credit and other secured borrowings

the increased charges to financial services for are partly the result of the acquisition of nci in june in addition  technology support revenue from financial services was higher in because the technology products segment increased its development efforts for nci during and added a significant amount of technology assets for the nci operations 
during the second quarter of  technology products began charging servicing and other segments for technology services according to a market based rate card instead of the cost based method that we used previously

technology and communications expense 
technology and communications expense increased by  in as compared to principally as a result of supporting the software and systems of nci for a full year in the increases were partially offset by lower support costs for the remaining operations

we will not resume applying the equity method until our share of bms holdings earnings exceeds our share of their losses that we did not recognize during the period when the equity method was suspended 
the results of bms holdings were negatively impacted by unrealized losses on auction rate securities

as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  because of failed auctions  we have been unable to fully liquidate the investment grade auction rate securities that we invested in during the first quarter of these securities are collateralized by student loans originated under the federal family education loan program 
the loans are guaranteed for no less than of their unpaid principal balance in the event of default 
our determination of the estimated fair value  which included our consideration of the strong credit quality of the underlying collateral and the securities we hold  limited market activity including sales of our own holdings  creditworthiness of the issuers  estimated holding period and general auction rate securities market conditions  required the significant use of unobservable inputs 
we estimate that an increase in the holding period of months  with a commensurate increase in the discount rate  would reduce the estimated fair value by approximately 
alternatively  a decrease in the holding period of the auction rate securities of months  with a commensurate decrease in the discount rate  would increase the estimated fair value by approximately 
when liquidity returns to the auction rate securities market we expect to sell our securities 
the  decline in other investment grade securities during was primarily due to the sale of our remaining cmos  which had a fair value of  at december  goodwill and intangibles 
based on the values and terms of the proposals received from third parties interested in acquiring bok  we determined that the values of goodwill and intangibles related to bok were impaired and wrote off the remaining  carrying value of goodwill and the  carrying value of intangibles in the second quarter of we have recently received non binding proposals for the purchase of our investment in bok that are in excess of the current book value 
we expect to reach an agreement of sale of our investment subject to regulatory approval in as a result of our decision in the fourth quarter of to sell our investment in bok  we report the operating results of bok as discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on bok and discontinued operations 
premises and equipment 
the decline in premises and equipment in is primarily due to the sale of our customer service and collection facility in orlando  florida 
in december  we executed a sale leaseback agreement whereby we sold and immediately leased back this facility 
the transaction did not initially qualify for sale leaseback accounting because of our continuing involvement in the form of a significant sublease and a collateral deposit securing a letter of credit that guaranteed our lease payments 
as a result  we accounted for the transaction as a financing 
we recorded the sales proceeds of  as a financing obligation in other liabilities and continued to depreciate the building 
in december  we assigned the lease to a third party resulting in the termination of the sublease and guarantee and the return of our collateral deposit 
because we had no significant continuing involvement with the property  we recognized the sale in december and recorded a gain of the combined net book value of the land  building and related improvements was  at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding this transaction 
receivables 
receivables are primarily comprised of mortgage loans originated by bok  long term receivables representing proceeds from the sale of affordable housing investments  current income taxes receivable and security deposits 
the  decline in is primarily due to collections of affordable housing receivables 
lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
the balance at december  primarily represented financing obligations outstanding under repurchase agreements collateralized by cmos 
the decline in the outstanding balance during is the result of our sale of the cmos 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
investment line 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we executed an amendment to the investment line in july that created a term note that matures on june  the note is secured by our investment in auction rate securities 
interest on the term note is on that portion of the outstanding balance that does not exceed the amount of demand balances on deposit with the lender 
for any portion of the outstanding balance of the term note that is in excess of the demand deposits  the interest rate is month libor plus basis points 
maximum borrowing is currently limited to of the face amount of the securities and declines to by march  under the term note  we receive the interest on the auction rate securities while the proceeds from the redemption or sale of auction rate securities are applied to the outstanding balance 
if the proceeds are below the then effective maximum borrowing percentage  we are required to make up the shortfall 
if the application of proceeds to the outstanding balance results in the total outstanding balance of this note falling below of the face value of the auction rate securities held  we receive one half of sales or redemptions  and the remainder is used to pay down the investment line 
during  we have made principal payments totaling  which have reduced the investment line obligation to  debt securities 
debt securities consisted of the following at december contingent convertible senior unsecured notes due august  capital trust securities due august  during the second quarter of  we repurchased  of the convertible notes in the open market generating total gains of  net of the write off of unamortized issuance costs

lease obligations 
lease obligations at december  included a financing obligation with an outstanding balance of  related to a sale leaseback transaction involving our customer service and collection facility in orlando  florida  which we accounted for as a financing until we assigned the lease to a third party in a transaction that we completed in december see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding this transaction

operating expenses 
operating expenses for are  higher than principally because of  of professional fees that we incurred in connection with strategic initiatives 
of this amount   represents due diligence and other costs related to the going private transaction which was initiated in january and which the parties mutually terminated in march the remainder primarily represents costs related to the spin off of os 
operating expenses are net of overhead allocations to other segments 
operating expenses include costs incurred in connection with affordable housing activities which  in  included a reversal of a  litigation accrual that we had established in in connection with the potential settlement of a contractual dispute 
interest income 
interest income on short term investment grade securities  including cmos and commercial paper  for declined by  or as compared to principally due to an decline in the average balance of our investment in these securities 
in addition  interest income for and includes  and respectively  of discount accretion on certificates of deposit that we redeemed in august loss on trading securities 
the loss on trading securities was comprised of the following realized losses investment grade auction rate cmos other unrealized losses investment grade auction rate cmos subordinates and residuals other other  net 
other  net for includes the  loss on our early redemption of certificates of deposit during the third quarter 
in august  we redeemed our investment in certificates of deposit prior to their maturity in order to meet an unanticipated liquidity need 
the cash received from the issuer upon redemption was less than the adjusted cost basis of the certificates of deposit  resulting in a loss 
we had acquired the certificates of deposit in november at a discount from the face value 
prior to redemption  we were accreting the discount on the certificates of deposit to income using the interest method 
minority interest in subsidiaries minority interest of and  at december  and  respectively  primarily represented the investment in gss held by merrill lynch 
minority interest declined by  in principally because gss distributed  cash to its members during the fourth quarter  which reduced minority interest by  stockholder s equity stockholders equity amounted to  at december  as compared to  at december  the  increase in stockholders equity during was primarily due to net income of  a  increase in additional paid in capital and a increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the increase in additional paid in capital was primarily due to an increase of  related to expirations of vested options that had been accounted under the intrinsic value method of apb no 
 net of the related deferred tax asset reversal  and compensation of  related to employee share based awards 
the increase in other comprehensive income was primarily the result of the change in unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit was   and  for  and  respectively 
the tax benefit primarily reflects the reversal of  of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets  in order to increase the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance in  we primarily based our determination on the following cumulative taxable earnings in recent periods  positive outlook for future taxable earnings  the disposal of nearly all of our non core assets 
excluding the effect of the reversal of valuation allowances  in and  and the increase in valuation allowance in  our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
for the years through  we paid cash taxes at rates less than our effective tax rate due to the utilization of tax benefits  including low income housing tax credits 
our federal us cash tax rate for  and approximates 
when combined with u 
s state and international cash taxes  the rates are  and  respectively 
at december   we have  of low income housing tax credits available to reduce future taxable income 
income tax expense benefit on income before income taxes differs from amounts that would be computed by applying the federal corporate income tax rate of primarily because of the effect of foreign taxes  foreign income with an indefinite deferral from us taxation  losses from consolidated vies  state taxes  low income housing tax credits and changes in the valuation allowance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of taxes at the statutory rate to actual income tax expense benefit 
our effective tax rate for includes a benefit of approximately associated with the recognition of certain foreign deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate for would have been but was increased by approximately due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on certain nci related state net operating losses and due to recognition of additional tax expense associated with the expiration of certain vested stock options 
our effective tax rate for includes a benefit of approximately associated with the recognition of certain foreign deferred tax assets and associated with certain provision to return reconciling items recognized in the fourth quarter 
these reconciling items are a result of certain estimates we used in our year end tax provision for which we obtained additional information as part of the tax return preparation process 
our effective rate for excludes the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance but includes a reduction of for the anticipated use of tax credits during that year 
no such benefit is included in our effective tax rate for or because we reversed the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources during  our cash balance increased from  to  an improvement of  we implemented strategies to increase cash in direct response to the challenging condition of the credit markets since the second half of at that time the market for new subprime loans evaporated and the delinquency rate on the loans that we serviced started increasing rapidly  driving up our investment in advances 
we added loan resolution staff to reduce the growth in delinquencies  and advances started to decline by the second quarter of since the credit markets became challenged we have substantially reduced the growth in the delinquency rate  substantially reduced the number of delinquent loans  substantially reduced advances  maintained sufficient advance financing capacity  maintained sufficient performance of our advance collateral to qualify for financing  slowed purchases of msrs  reduced non core assets and right sized the business to grow cash 
the greatest liquidity impact on us since the credit markets became challenged has been the failure of the auction rate securities market as we were holding  of aaa rated federal family education loan program student loan bonds that we financed through the investment line 
in response to the broad impact of the challenging credit markets on our business  we have extended our investment line through june  at december   the fair value of the auction rate securities financed on this term note was  while the amount financed was  and repaid  of the balance maintained match funded advance facility capacity that was  at december  and  at december   by replacing notes that entered amortization in  renewed  increased or added multiple advance financing facilities  and reduced advances and match funded advances by  in as a result  since december   our unrestricted cash position has increased from  to  at december  further plans to improve liquidity in include further reductions in advances  increases in match funded advance financing and selling non core assets 
although successful execution cannot be guaranteed  management believes that these plans are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
we are currently in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with all financial covenants 
however  if our efforts to maintain liquidity are not successful  or if unanticipated market factors emerge  the result could have a material adverse impact upon our business  results of operations and financial position 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity are match funded liabilities lines of credit and other secured borrowings servicing fees  including float earnings payments received on loans held for resale payments received on trading securities debt securities our primary uses of funds are the funding of servicing advances  the payment of interest and operating expenses and the repayment of borrowings 
we closely monitor our liquidity position and ongoing funding requirements  and we invest available funds in short term investment grade securities 
our servicing agreements impose on us various rights and obligations that affect our liquidity 
among the most significant is our obligation to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest payments for certain investors and to pay taxes  insurance  foreclosure costs and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced 
delinquency rates and prepayment speed affect the size of servicing advance balances 
although the number of delinquent loans declined during  the non performing loan rate has been increasing gradually for all four quarters of at   and of upb at march   june   september  and december   respectively 
prepayment speeds averaged for the first quarter of  for both the second and third quarters of and for the fourth quarter of a decrease in the number of delinquent loans is the primary factor driving the decrease in servicing advances during management initiatives that are designed to maximize the return to the loan investors resulted in increased loan modifications 
based on current trends  we believe that servicing advances for our current portfolio peaked in march however  if prepayment speeds decrease in or if the success of the loan modification programs does not continue  advances on the existing servicing portfolio will decline at a slower pace or could increase 
our ability to finance servicing advances is a significant factor that affects our liquidity 
two of our match funded advance facilities that are rated and a third that is in the process of being rated are subject to increases in the financing discount if deemed necessary by the rating agency in order to maintain the minimum rating required for the facility 
also important is the performance of the collateral pledged to each advance facility relative to the requirements of that facility so that this collateral may remain pledged 
at present  there are only a limited number of loans and or securitizations that do not qualify for financing under the advance facility to which they are pledged  but this could become a more significant factor if there is a material deterioration in loan performance 
a federal moratorium on foreclosures could increase the timeline to recover advances  increase advance balances  reduce advance rates  limit future borrowing or cause a repayment of borrowing on certain facilities 
finally  some of our existing debt covenants limit our ability to incur additional debt in relation to our equity and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquid assets  earnings and unused borrowing capacity 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in restrictions on new borrowings or the early termination of our borrowing facilities 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants  and we do not expect them to restrict our activities 
therefore  having sufficient financing capacity  limiting the growth in servicing advances and maintaining loan performance are all essential to maintaining liquidity 
maximum borrowing capacity of the servicing segment was  at december   a decrease of  as compared to december  as total advances in this segment declined by  and residential msrs declined by  as a result of these declines as well as declines in loans held for resale and residual trading securities  the decrease in total borrowing capacity of all segments during  excluding the investment line  was  the decrease in servicing segment borrowing capacity principally reflects the maturity of the senior secured credit facility in august the capacity of our match funded servicing advance facilities decreased by  from  at december  to  at december  we repaid term notes of  and  outstanding under one of our match funded facilities that had entered their amortization periods during the first and second quarters of  respectively 
however  additional borrowing capacity was available through other notes that are secured by the same collateral pools 
we also paid off the  variable funding note under another match funded liability that had entered its amortization period during the first quarter of offsetting these decreases were a  increase in capacity under a match funded facility when it was renewed in february and the addition of a  match funded note that we secured in april our  senior secured credit facility was the only source of debt that was available to fund the purchase of residential msrs  and it matured in august this facility contained the option of an month term note to finance msrs 
we exercised this option  and in august  we repaid the borrowings under the facility that were secured by advances and converted our remaining borrowings that were secured by msrs to a term note that matures in february our borrowing to fund msrs was  at december  the borrowing amount each month is limited to the lesser of a predetermined straight line  eighteen month amortization schedule and of a third party appraisal value of the msrs 
borrowing under this facility declined by  as compared to december  in the table below  we provide the amortization dates and maturity dates for each of our credit facilities as of december   excluding the investment line 
the amortization date is the date on which the revolving period ends under our advance facilities and repayment of the outstanding balance must begin if the facility is not renewed or extended 
the maturity date is the date on which all outstanding balances must be repaid 
after the amortization date  all collections that represent the repayment of advances that have been financed through the facility must be applied to reduce the balance outstanding under the facility  and any new advances under the securitizations pledged to the facility are ineligible to be financed 
in order for us to maintain liquidity  borrowings under facilities that have entered their amortization period and have not been renewed must be repaid and new advances under the securitizations must be pledged to another facility 
our credit facilities  excluding the investment line  are summarized as follows at december  amortization date maturity maximum borrowing capacity unused borrowing capacity balance outstanding servicing match funded liability nov

total borrowings basis adjustment borrowing capacity under a secured advance facility may only be utilized to the extent that qualifying collateral is available to be pledged to that financing facility 
the  fixed rate term note issued in was carried on the balance sheet at fair value as the result of a designated fair value hedging relationship that we established through the use of an interest rate swap 
we terminated the related interest rate swap in february and began amortizing the basis adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the note 
a  term note under this facility entered its amortization period and was repaid in march a  term note entered its amortization period in may and was repaid in august in december  we entered into an agreement to extend the amortization date of the  variable funding note under this facility by one year to december in january  we renewed this facility early which extended the amortization date for this facility to january this facility was implemented in april this facility contained the option of an month term note to finance msrs 
we provided notice that we intended to exercise this option 
upon conversion to a term note  we repaid all borrowings under this facility that were secured by advances and moved the collateral to other  match funded advance facilities 
certain of our credit facilities require that we maintain minimum liquidity levels or borrowing capacity  and we are in compliance with these requirements 
we had an aggregate balance of  outstanding at december  under match funded financing facilities that are scheduled to enter their amortization period or reach their maturity date during the next twelve months 
the amortization date for  outstanding under one facility was extended to january as a result of an extension of the facility that we negotiated in january even with the expectation that advance balances will decline into the future  we will continue to pursue additional advance financing to increase our margin of safety and to provide the flexibility to acquire new servicing business 
however  if advances do not continue to decline and the credit markets do not improve  we may need to increase our advance financing capacity at a cost that is significantly higher than under our current advance facilities 
we will continue to work closely with current and prospective lenders as we monitor our operating results  financing capacity requirements and terms for advance funding available in the market 
we are poised to take advantage of opportunities to increase financing at a reasonable cost or to act aggressively to ensure adequate liquidity if additional financing is needed and credit markets remain challenged 
we have the following potential uses of cash cash requirements to fund advances and the cash needs of our existing operations  commitment to invest up to an additional  in onl and affiliates  retirement of our convertible notes  maturity of the investment line on june   if not renewed or replaced  repayment of the balance of our term note which finances our msrs in the amount of  per month or more if necessary such that the borrowing balance does not exceed of the appraised value  repayment of advance borrowing should the advance rate decline or the collateral become ineligible  and incremental costs for contractual services received at market rates from ocwen solutions after the spin 
we may also evaluate the retirement of our capital trust securities 
regarding our investment in bms holdings  we are under no obligation to provide additional funding

the improvement in over primarily reflects a decline in the funding requirements of our servicing operations partially offset by our investment in auction rate securities 
the net cash flows used by operating activities in primarily reflects a significant reduction in net cash provided by loans held for resale due to the closing of our subprime loan origination operation and increased funding requirements of the servicing business because of increases in advances that were attributable to declining prepayments and rising delinquencies 
these reductions were somewhat offset by an increase in net cash provided by trading activities reflecting our sale of the uk residuals and the maturity of commercial paper investments 
the net cash flows provided by operating activities in largely reflect the sale and securitization of loans held for resale  offset in part by the funding requirements of our servicing operations 
the operating funding requirements of our servicing business are primarily reflected in the change in servicing advances and servicer liabilities which collectively provided  of net cash during these same items used  and  of cash during and  respectively

our investing activities provided used cash flows totaling   and  during  and  respectively 
the improvement in over is in large part due to a  decline in purchases of msrs  reflecting a more cautious acquisition strategy in response to the turmoil in the subprime mortgage market

actual interest on match funded liabilities was  in future interest may vary depending on utilization and changes in libor and spreads 
we believe that we have adequate resources to meet all contractual obligations as they come due 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we engage in transactions with a variety of financial institutions and other companies that are not reflected on our balance sheet 
in addition  through our investment in subordinate and residual securities  we provide credit support to the senior classes of securities 
we are subject to potential financial loss if the counterparties to our off balance sheet transactions are unable to complete an agreed upon transaction 
we seek to limit counterparty risk through financial analysis  dollar limits and other monitoring procedures 
we have also entered into non cancelable operating leases and have committed to invest up to an additional  in onl and related entities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our lease obligations 
derivatives 
we record all derivative transactions at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
we use these derivatives primarily to manage our interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the notional amounts of our derivative contracts do not reflect our exposure to credit loss 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivatives 
involvement with spes 
we use spes for a variety of purposes but principally in the financing of our servicing advances and in the securitization of mortgage loans 
our securitizations of mortgage loans have been structured as sales in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and the spes to which we have transferred the mortgage loans are qualifying special purpose entities qspes under sfas no 
and are therefore not currently subject to consolidation 
we have retained both subordinated and residual interests in these qspes 
where we are the servicer of the securitized loans  we generally have the right to repurchase the mortgage loans from the qspe when the costs exceed the benefits of servicing the remaining loans 
see note to our interim consolidated financial statements for information regarding proposed amendments to sfas no 
that eliminate the qspe concept 
we generally use match funded securitization facilities to finance our servicing advances 
the spes to which the advances are transferred in the securitization transaction are included in our consolidated financial statements either because the transfer did not qualify for sales accounting treatment or because the spe is not a qspe  and we have the majority equity interest in the spe  or we are the primary beneficiary where the spe is also a vie 
the holders of the debt of these spes can look only to the assets of the spes for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against ocn 
however  ols has guaranteed the payment of the obligations of the issuer under a match funded facility that closed in april the maximum amount payable under the guarantee is limited to of the notes outstanding at the end of the facility s revolving period

and to remove the scope exception for qspes from fin r 
during september  the fasb issued three separate but related exposure drafts for public comment 
the proposed fasb statements address amendments to sfas no

apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this fsp clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement are not addressed by paragraph of apb opinion no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
additionally  this fsp specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
upon adoption of this fsp  we will recognize a discount to reduce the carrying value of the convertible notes component of our debt securities and an offsetting increase to stockholders equity 
due to the retrospective accretion of the resulting debt discount to interest expense over the expected life of the notes and adjustments to gains or losses recognized on previous redemptions  we anticipate the adoption of this fsp to result in a reduction of retained earnings of  prospectively  we anticipate an increase in non cash interest expense while the notes remain outstanding 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands market risk includes liquidity risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
market risk also reflects the risk of declines in the valuation of trading securities  msrs and in the value of the collateral underlying loans 
we are exposed to liquidity risk primarily because of the highly variable daily cash requirements to support the servicing business including the requirement to make advances pursuant to servicing contracts and the process of remitting borrower payments to the custodial accounts 
in general  we finance our operations through operating cash flows and various other sources of funding including match funded agreements  secured lines of credit and repurchase agreements 
we believe that we have adequate financing for the next twelve months 
we also anticipate that we will be successful in negotiating an extension of the investment line 
however  because of the failed auctions  the market for investment grade auction rate securities is not currently liquid 
in the event we need to liquidate our investment  we may not be able to do so without a loss of principal 
we are exposed to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different speeds  or different bases  than our interest earning assets or when financed assets are not interest bearing 
our servicing business is characterized by non interest earning assets financed by interest bearing liabilities 
among the more significant non interest earning assets are servicing advances and msrs 
at december   we had total advances and match funded advances of  we are also exposed to interest rate risk because a portion of our outstanding debt is variable rate 
rising interest rates may increase our interest expense 
nevertheless  earnings on float balances assets partially offset this variability 
we have also entered into interest rate caps to hedge our exposure to rising interest rates on both a  and a  match funded advance facility that have variable rates of interest 
december  total borrowings outstanding fixed rate borrowings variable rate borrowings float balances held in custodial accounts  excluded from our balance sheet notional balance of interest rate caps in  we recorded  of float earnings as a component of servicing and subservicing fees 
our balance sheet at december  included interest earning assets totaling  including  of investment grade auction rate securities   of debt service accounts   of loans held for resale and  of interest earning collateral accounts 
interest rates  prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the loans significantly affect both our initial and ongoing valuations of and the rate of amortization of msrs 
as of december   the carrying value and estimated fair value of our residential mortgage servicing rights were  and  respectively 
we face little market risk with regard to our advances and match funded advances on loans serviced for others 
this is because we are obligated to fund advances only to the extent that we believe that they are recoverable and because advances generally are the first obligations to be satisfied when a securitization trust disburses funds 
we are indirectly exposed to interest risk by our funding of advances because approximately of our total advances and match funded advances are funded through borrowings  and most of the debt is variable rate debt 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our investment in non us dollar functional currency operations to the extent that our foreign exchange positions remain unhedged 
our operations in canada  germany  uruguay and india expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk  but we consider this risk to be insignificant 
we have entered into foreign currency futures contracts to hedge the value of our net investment in bok against adverse changes in the value of the euro versus the us dollar 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments we perform an interest rate sensitivity analysis of our portfolio of msrs every quarter 
we currently estimate that the fair value of the portfolio decreases or increases by approximately or  respectively  for every basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
this sensitivity analysis is limited in that it is performed at a particular point in time  only contemplates certain movements in interest rates  does not incorporate changes in interest rate volatility  is subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used  including prepayment forecasts and discount rates  and does not incorporate other factors that would impact our overall financial performance in such scenarios 
we carry msrs at the lower of amortized cost or fair value by strata 
to the extent that fair value were to decline below amortized cost  we would record an impairment charge to earnings and establish a valuation allowance 
a subsequent increase in fair value could result in the recovery of some or all of a previously established valuation allowance 
however  an increase in fair value of a particular stratum above its amortized cost would not be reflected in current earnings 
for these reasons  this interest rate sensitivity estimate should not be viewed as an earnings forecast

we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  we base expected maturities upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal 
we base the prepayment experience reflected herein on our historical experience 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from our historical experience

the balances are net of market valuation allowances and include non performing loans 
interest on the term note is on that portion of the outstanding balance that does not exceed the amount of available balances on deposit with the lender 
for any portion of the outstanding balance of the term note that is in excess of the available balances  the interest rate is month libor plus basis points 
the rate may be adjusted upward by the lender to a maximum of if the lender determines that the rate does not fairly reflect the cost to the lender of providing the funds
