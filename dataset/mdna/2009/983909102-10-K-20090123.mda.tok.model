item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal earnings grew on growth in revenues of as we shipped and installed the largest order in our history while continuing to execute on strategies to focus on our target customers  increase our services revenues  and align our sales efforts with our manufacturers go to market strategies 
in november  we announced the award of a series of orders from miami dade county public schools m dcps to sell and install new communications systems at approximately schools in the m dcps district 
the order was valued at over million including equipment  implementation  professional services  cabling and on going maintenance revenues 
we also enjoyed strong growth in our lodging business as a result of the robust new construction environment through most of the fiscal year and the successful roll out of our mitel product and service offering 
we began selling mitel products late in fiscal mitel products are well established in the lodging market and we were successful during the year in capturing market share from new and existing customers as a result of carrying mitel products 
our services business grew during the year through a combination of increased implementation revenues  primarily from the m dcps contract and additional growth in our managed services business 
increasing our base of recurring revenues through both direct and wholesale services offerings is one of our key strategies 
the rate of growth of these revenues dropped sharply in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting some attrition in our wholesale partners service programs and some difficulty in landing new large programs 
we are continuing to invest in the growth of this area of our business and expect improved growth rates in fiscal as we expand our presence with existing and new partners and as economic pressures increase the level of service outsourcing by end users 
based on current us and global economic conditions and the restrictions on credit  we expect fiscal to be a challenging year 
we have taken prudent steps to trim our workforce and reduce discretionary costs 
we are optimistic that the challenging environment will present some opportunities for us as many end users may choose to maintain their current systems rather than replace them  and large users give stronger consideration to out sourcing the support of their voice networks to shed high labor costs within their organizations 
additionally  we are focusing our marketing efforts and sales calls on high return on investment applications that will help companies lower their costs in the current environment 
finally  we believe consolidation of the dealer community may accelerate as the tight economy pressures liquidity and exposes weak operating models 
we are actively reviewing potential acquisitive growth opportunities and those opportunities have increased 
no assurance can be given  however  that these opportunities will prove worthwhile  can be purchased at reasonable prices  and or that we can assemble sufficient capital through combinations of senior debt facilities  equity placements  seller financing  and or other viable methods 
the discussion that follows provides more details regarding the factors and trends that affected our financial results  liquidity  and capital resources in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
net income for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal services revenues 
revenues earned from our services business were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
this growth reflects a or million increase in recurring services revenues  a or million increase in implementation revenues  and a or  increase in structured cabling revenues 
the increases in our recurring services business  which includes revenues earned from maintenance contracts and time and materials t m based charges  consisted of growth in our contract maintenance revenues of  partially offset by lower t m revenues of 
the growth rate in contract revenues in fiscal was lower than expected due to lower growth in commercial contract revenues 
most of our efforts to increase our services revenues are focused on our commercial services offerings  particularly our wholesale managed services offerings in which we partner with nortel  network services companies  and systems integrators to provide a variety of technical services to our partners end user customers 
we have invested heavily in sales and technical resources to create opportunities with current and potential wholesale partners 
once those relationships are established  we typically market our capabilities jointly with our partners to end users who are requesting bids for new services or who are renewing existing contracts 
this is a highly competitive market and end users can demand both favorable pricing and high service levels because of their size and prominence 
in most cases  our service performance is measured monthly  quarterly and or annually by our wholesale partner 
to date  our service ratings have been excellent 
however  our experience to date indicates that excellent service ratings are expected from end users  but pricing continues to drive most decisions 
as a result  we have limited influence in contract negotiations between our wholesale partners and end users 
this is a key difference between our direct and wholesale service offerings 
our experience to date indicates that the growth in our wholesale services business will likely be choppy and will include large contract wins being partially mitigated by occasional large contract losses and the losses will likely be out of our control 
the growth in our implementation revenues in fiscal was due to the m dcps contract  which provided over million in implementation revenues 
these higher revenues resulted in improved utilization of services personnel and helped to absorb the fixed cost structure in this portion of our services organization 
our structured cabling business grew by approximately to million in fiscal about one half of the growth in structured cabling revenues related to the m dcps contract 
in some school locations  the school system was required to install their new pbx systems in a new  more secure location in the school 
the cost to rewire the building to support this requirement was included on some of the orders 
the remainder of the growth in structured cabling was due to increased new construction and remodeling that occurred prior to the economic downturn and continued market acceptance of our nationwide structured cabling service offering 
systems sales 
sales of systems were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
sales of systems to commercial customers were million in fiscal  a increase compared to fiscal sales of systems to hospitality customers were million in fiscal  an increase compared to the prior year 
the increase in sales of systems to commercial customers is attributable to the m dcps contract which produced million in equipment revenues during fiscal under the terms of the m dcps contract  we installed new avaya pbx systems at schools across the district who qualified for the federal e rate funding program 
under the e rate program  the school district submits a proposal to the federal agency that administers the program for the acquisition and installation of qualifying equipment at its schools which qualify for high levels of federal assistance under the school lunch program 
under the program  the school district pays for of qualifying equipment and installation and of any non qualifying equipment or services 
as previously stated  we recognized all of the revenue from these orders in fiscal the increase in lodging equipment sales was due to improved penetration into existing accounts and new customer acquisition 
the lodging market is relatively mature  but a healthy new construction market and our introduction of the mitel product line as part our equipment and service offerings combined to generate new opportunities for us throughout the year 
fiscal may be a challenging year for selling new systems to both the commercial and lodging markets  although existing construction projects in the lodging industry may continue to drive demand in this sector for another six to nine months 
most us businesses are experiencing some level of difficulty in the current economic recession and capital budgets are being reduced sharply 
recent forecasts for growth in capital spending on it related products in were reduced from around to just over 
while we have not seen such a rapid decline in our order rates as of the date of this report  there can be no assurance given that our equipment business will not suffer a sudden and severe decline in other revenues 
other revenues were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal other revenues consist of commissions earned on the sale of avaya maintenance contracts and sales of equipment and or services made outside of our normal provisioning processes 
the increase in other revenues is attributable to an increase in the sales of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts 
under our dealer agreement with avaya  we are incentivized to market their maintenance contracts to the avaya customer base 
we are paid a commission on these contracts based on the size and length of the contract and the underlying equipment covered under the agreement 
sales of products provisioned outside of our normal processes generally reflects sales of phone sets to hospitality customers in which we earn a small  flat  per phone profit on the transaction 
other revenues also include restocking fees earned on canceled orders 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margins earned on services revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the margins earned on services revenues in fiscal were below our target for these revenues 
gross margins on services were negatively affected by the slow down in the growth rate of recurring services revenues 
this slow down began in the first quarter of fiscal as our mac t m revenues declined dramatically and the rate of growth in new wholesale services programs declined from fiscal levels 
because these revenues grew rapidly in the second half of fiscal  the cost structure to support these revenues was growing rapidly as we entered the year 
this momentum in cost build up coupled with a sharp decline in the growth rate combined to produce lower than expected gross margins 
as we adjusted the cost structure and as revenues rationalized in the second half of the year  our margins improved 
services margins in the second half of fiscal were also helped by stronger implementation and structured cabling revenues as a compressed m dcps installation schedule pushed more installations of systems into the third quarter and first half of the fourth quarter 
gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal these margins are slightly higher than our expectations and reflect our continued focus on systems sales margins through controls around contract acceptance and margin reviews 
we also work closely with both our manufacturers and our product distributors to maximize vendor support through their rebate  promotion  and competitive discount programs 
these programs have been relatively unchanged for the past three fiscal years allowing us to maximize our capture of these discounts and rebates 
despite producing higher margins on systems sales in fiscal  this remains a highly competitive market and downward margin pressure is a constant in this segment of our business 
we continue to believe that the techniques and disciplines we have employed over the last three fiscal years will enable us to maintain our gross margins on systems sales 
however  we can give no assurance regarding possible changes in our vendor support programs or other market factors that could either increase or lower margins 
a final component to our gross margins is the margins earned on other revenues 
these include costs incurred to market and administer the avaya post warranty maintenance contracts we sell and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses 
while we earn a commission on the sale of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts which has no direct cost of goods sold  we incur costs in marketing and administration of these contracts before submitting them to avaya 
corporate cost of goods sold represents the cost of our material logistics  warehousing  advance replacement of service spare parts  and purchasing functions 
corporate cost of goods sold was of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal increases in operating expenses included increased selling expenses primarily in the form of increased sales personnel targeted at selling our wholesale services initiative 
other significant increases were increased costs associated with the support of our oracle platform  increased fas r compensation expense due to the issuance of incentive stock options  increased legal fees related to higher levels of litigation  and increased amortization expense driven by expanded utilization of our enterprise technology platform and the amortization of intangible assets from small acquisitions 
we continue to be optimistic that the growth in our operating expenses will decline to between and of our revenues as we increase our revenue base and our sales efficiency improves through higher proportions of recurring revenues 
we have targeted our rate of growth in operating expenses  particularly selling  general and administrative expenses  to be approximately one half the rate of growth in revenues to bring these costs in line with our expectations 
interest expense and other income 
interest expense consists primarily of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense increased in fiscal by approximately  compared to fiscal reflecting higher average borrowing during the year and the fact that we ceased capitalization of interest cost on the oracle implementation project at the end of fiscal the cash cycle on the m dcps project was extremely long and forced us to borrow heavily on our revolving line of credit in fiscal to meet working capital needs 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately  in tax expense 
we have recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in this increase reflects improved gross profit margins on the sale of equipment in fiscal our current business model targets an operating margin of to to be reached in the next three to five years 
however  we will have to realize sustained growth in our revenues  continued improvements in total gross margins  primarily in our service gross margins  and a significantly slower growth rate in operating expenses to meet this target 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
net income for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal services revenues 
revenues earned from our services business were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase and included growth in all three major services revenue streams including our recurring services  implementation services  and our national cabling business 
recurring services revenues increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily reflecting our success in the expansion of our wholesale services initiative 
our implementation revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million or compared to the prior year 
the growth in our implementation revenues was a key factor in our success in fiscal as higher levels of revenues resulted in better absorption of the significant fixed cost structure in this portion of our services organization 
the growth rate was significantly greater than our growth in systems sales  the historical driver of these revenues 
the additional growth came from several large installation and professional services contracts sold separately from systems sales 
additionally  the proportion of installation and professional services fees continued to increase in comparison to the total project price as the complexity of the applications we sell increased 
all of these increased revenues improved our utilization of our resources and contributed to the overall increase in our services gross profits during fiscal our structured cabling revenues grew to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in these revenues was a direct result of the establishment of a national structured cabling business that markets our cabling services to existing and new customers 
systems sales 
sales of systems were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
sales of systems to commercial customers were million in fiscal  a increase compared to fiscal the increase in sales of systems to commercial customers was primarily the result of the success of our strategy to focus on our manufacturers lines of business 
sales of systems to hospitality customers were million in fiscal  an increase compared to fiscal this increase reflected our strong market position in the hospitality market and the acceptance of our nortel product line to hospitality customers 
other revenues were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in other revenues was attributable to an increase in the sales of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margins earned on services revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase reflected improvements in gross margins earned on recurring services and implementation revenues  while gross margins on cabling revenues were relatively flat compared to the prior year 
the margins on recurring services improved slightly due to better utilization of our contact center and field services personnel  lower materials costs and improved utilization of qualified third party service providers 
the profitability of implementation and professional services was the largest contributor to the significant increase in overall services profitability in fiscal as discussed above under services revenues  increased implementation revenues resulted in improved absorption of the fixed costs of this element of our services organization 
the gross margins earned on cabling revenues were consistent with fiscal and with our expectations for fiscal gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal these margins were consistent with our expectations for systems sales 
a final component to our gross margins was the margins earned on other revenues 
see discussion of gross margins on other revenues in the caption gross margins under fiscal year compared to fiscal year above for an explanation of composition of these margins 
corporate cost of goods sold decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was due to increased sales expenses to support our wholesale services sales initiative  increased gross profit and net income based incentive payments to employees due to improved profitability  increased fas r compensation expense due to the issuance of stock options in fiscal and  increased amortization expense from the expanded utilization of our enterprise technology platform  and increased marketing expenses related to a major marketing event held around the pga championship during our fourth fiscal quarter of interest and other income 
interest expense decreased in fiscal by approximately  compared to fiscal this change primarily reflects lower overall borrowing costs in compared to the previous year due to less outstanding debt 
during fiscal  we reduced our mortgage debt by  through cash on hand and funds generated from operations and enjoyed lower average amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately  in tax expense 
we recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal this rate reflected the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in this increase reflected improved gross profit margins partially offset by higher operating expenses as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our financial condition improved during fiscal as our working capital grew by to million and we generated million in cash flows from operations 
these cash flows included cash from earnings and non cash charges of million  increases in accounts payable of million  and increases in deferred tax liabilities of  these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventory of  and other changes in working capital items  which netted to a decrease in cash of  we used these cash flows to reduce borrowings on our working capital line of credit by  reduce our mortgage balance through scheduled principal payments by  to fund other financing and investing activities of million and to fund capital expenditures of million 
of these capital expenditures   was spent on capital equipment as part of normal replacement of our information technology infrastructure and headquarters facility 
the remaining  was spent on our oracle implementation 
non cash charges included depreciation expense of  amortization expense of  stock based compensation expense of  a provision for doubtful accounts receivable of  and a provision for obsolete inventory of  at october  we had capitalized million on the oracle project 
we have segregated the cost of this asset into four classifications with estimated useful lives of three  five  seven and ten years 
in fiscal we began amortizing the cost of those portions of the system that were ready for use 
our operating results for fiscal years and include  and  respectively  in amortization expense related to the project 
as noted above  our deferred tax liabilities increased  during fiscal and the balance of our noncurrent deferred tax liabilities was million at october  most of this balance and the annual increase in this account are due to the difference in accounting for goodwill between generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the us tax code 
under gaap  goodwill is not amortized  but instead is evaluated for impairment 
this evaluation is conducted as conditions warrant  but not less than annually under the guidelines set forth in sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
for tax purposes  goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over years 
as a result  the company receives a tax deduction of approximately th of its goodwill balance each year in its tax return 
this difference between amortization expense being recorded in the gaap based operating statements and approximately million in deductions taken on the tax return is recognized in the balance sheet as an additional noncurrent deferred taxliability 
the amount recorded is the difference multiplied by the effective tax rate 
this difference is recorded as a non current item because under gaap deferred taxes are recorded as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the asset or liability which generated the deferred tax item 
the deferred tax liability associated with goodwill accounting will not be reduced unless the company records in impairment charge to goodwill in a future accounting period 
at october  the balance on our working capital revolver was million  leaving million available for additional borrowings 
we believe that this available capacity is sufficient for our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
the revolver and the mortgage on our headquarters facility are scheduled to mature on september   however we expect to renew them for month and month periods  respectively prior to their expiration with similar terms 
at october   we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements 
in addition to the available capacity under our working capital line of credit  we believe we have access to a variety of capital sources such as private placements of subordinated debt  and public or private sales of additional equity 
however  there are currently no plans to issue such securities 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred  restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense 
 the adoption of sfas no 
r will change the accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as non controlling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas no 
is effective for us on a prospective basis for business combinations with an acq uisition date beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year as of october   the company did not have any minority interests  therefore the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp on financial accounting standards fsp fas  accounting for transfers of financial assets and repurchase financing transactions 
the fsp provides guidance on the accounting for a transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase financing 
repurchase financing is a repurchase agreement that relates to a previously transferred financial asset between the same counterparties or consolidated affiliates of either counterparty  that is entered into contemporaneously with  or in contemplation of  the initial transfer 
under the fsp  a transferor and transferee will not separately account for a transfer of a financial asset and a related repurchase financing unless a the two transactions have a valid and distinct business or economic purpose for being entered into separately  and b the repurchase financing does not result in the initial transferor regaining control over the financial asset 
an initial transfer of a financial asset and repurchase financing that are entered into contemporaneously with  or in contemplation of  one another shall be considered linked unless all of the following criteria are met at the inception of the transaction the initial transfer and the repurchase financing are not contractually contingent on one another 
the repurchase financing provides the initial transferor with recourse to the initial transferee upon default 
the financial asset subject to the initial transfer and repurchase financing is readily obtainable in the marketplace 
the financial asset and repurchase agreement are not coterminous the maturity of the repurchase financing must be before the maturity of the financial asset 
the fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is not permitted 
the company does not currently utilize repurchase financing  therefore  the implementation of this fsp is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in march the fasb issu ed sfas no 
 disclosure about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
 sfas 
this statement requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation 
the company is required to adopt sfas on or before november  the company currently does not participate in any derivative instruments or hedging activities as defined under sfas and therefore it is unlikely that the adoption of sfas will have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april the fasb issued fasb staff position on financial accounting standard fsp fas no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of intangible assets under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intent of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of the expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the as set under sfas no 
revised business combinations and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
the company will adopt this fsp in the first quarter of fiscal and will apply the guidance prospectively to intangible assets acquired after adoption 
in may the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements 
sfas is effective days following the sec s approval of the pub lic company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the us these accounting principles require us to exercise considerable judgment about future events that affect the amounts reported throughout our financial statements 
actual events could unfold quite differently than our judgments predicted 
therefore  the estimates and assumptions inherent in the financial statements included in this report could be materially different once actual events unfold 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or estimates were used  our financial statements could be materially different from those included in this report 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from equipment sales based on shipment of the equipment  which is generally easily determined 
revenues from installation and service activities are recognized based upon completion of the activity  which sometimes requires judgment on our part 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying contract 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we must make judgments about the collectibility of our accounts receivable to be able to present them at their net realizable value on the balance sheet 
to do this  we carefully analyze the aging of our customer accounts  try to understand why accounts have not been paid  and review historical bad debt problems 
from this analysis  we record an estimated allowance for receivables that we believe will ultimately become uncollectible 
we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize our credit risks and believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is fairly stated 
realizability of inventory values 
we make judgments about the ultimate realizability of our inventory in order to record our inventory at its lower of cost or market 
these judgments involve reviewing current demand for our products in comparison to present inventory levels and reviewing inventory costs compared to current market values 
we maintain a significant inventory of used and refurbished parts for which these assessments require a high degree of judgment 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisitions made between fiscal and we are responsible for reviewing goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we conducted these impairment tests on august for fiscal year and and on november for fiscal year we engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist us in this review 
in order to make this assessment each year  we prepared a long term forecast of the operating results and cash flows associated with the major reporting units of our business 
we prepared this forecast to determine the net discounted cash flows associated with each of these units 
the value of the discounted cash flows  less bank debt  was then compared to the book value of each of those units 
there is a great deal of judgment involved in making this assessment  including the growth rates of our various business lines  gross margins  operating margins  discount rates  and the capital expenditures needed to support the projected growth in revenues 
the valuation consultant engaged to assist in this evaluation  also examines additional data regarding competitors and market valuations 
this examination also requires a great amount of subjectivity and assumptions 
based on the work performed  we determined that the fair value was greater than our carrying value and therefore no impairment had occurred 
we have recorded property  equipment  and capitalized software costs at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the determination of useful economic lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
accruals for contractual obligations and contingent liabilities 
on products assembled or installed by us  we have varying degrees of warranty obligations 
we use historical trends and make other judgments to estimate our liability for such obligations 
we also must record estimated liabilities for many forms of federal  state  and local taxes 
our ultimate liability for these taxes depends upon a number of factors  including the interpretation of statutes and the mix of our taxable income between higher and lower taxing jurisdictions 
in addition  in the past we have been a party to threatened litigation or actual litigation in the normal course of business 
in such cases  we evaluate our potential liability  if any  and determine if an estimate of that liability should be recorded in our financial statements 
estimating both the probability of our liability and the potential amount of the liability are highly subjective exercises and are evaluated frequently as the underlying circumstances change
