overview the company was originally organized as universal heights  inc in the company changed its name to universal insurance holdings  inc on january  in april  the company organized its subsidiary upcic as part of its strategy to take advantage of what management believed to be profitable business and growth opportunities in the marketplace 
upcic was formed to participate in the transfer of homeowners insurance policies from the jua 
upcic s application to become a florida licensed property and casualty insurance company was filed with the oir on may  and approved on october  upcic s proposal to begin operations through the acquisition of homeowners insurance policies issued by the jua was approved by the jua on may   subject to certain minimum capitalization and other requirements 
the company has since evolved into a vertically integrated insurance holding company  which through its various subsidiaries  covers substantially all aspects of insurance underwriting  distribution and claims processing 
the company s primary product is homeowners insurance 
the company s criteria for selecting insurance policies includes  but is not limited to  the use of specific policy forms  coverage amounts on buildings and contents and required compliance with local building codes 
also  to improve underwriting and manage risk  the company utilizes standard industry modeling techniques for hurricane and windstorm exposure 
upcic s portfolio as of december  includes approximately  policies with coverage for wind risks and  policies without wind risks 
the average premium for a policy with wind coverage is approximately  and the average premium for a policy without wind coverage is approximately upcic had in force premiums of approximately million as of december the oir requires applicants to have a minimum capitalization of million to be eligible to operate as an insurance company in the state of florida 
upon being issued an insurance license  companies must maintain capitalization of the greater of ten percent of the insurer s total liabilities or million 
if an insurance company s capitalization falls below the minimum requirements  then the company will be deemed out of compliance with oir requirements  which could result in revocation of the participant s license to operate as an insurance company in the state of florida 
the company has continued to implement its plan to become a financial services company and  through its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries  has sought to position itself to take advantage of what management believes to be profitable business and growth opportunities in the marketplace 
in an effort to further grow its insurance operations  in the company began to solicit business actively in the open market 
through renewal of jua business combined with business solicited in the market through independent agents  upcic was servicing approximately  homeowners and dwelling fire insurance policies as of december  to improve underwriting and manage risk  the company utilizes standard industry modeling techniques for hurricane and windstorm exposure 
to diversify upcic s product lines  upcic underwrites inland marine policies 
in february  upcic filed a request with the national flood insurance program to become authorized to write and service flood insurance policies under the wyo program 
management may consider underwriting other types of policies in the future 
any such program will require oir approval 
see item  competition under factors affecting operating results and market price of stock for a discussion of the material conditions and uncertainties that may affect upcic s ability to obtain additional policies 
upcic has applied for expansion to write homeowners insurance policies in five additional states 
those states are texas  hawaii  georgia  south carolina and north carolina 
on july   august   september   and january   upcic was licensed to transact insurance business within the states of south carolina  hawaii  north carolina  and georgia  respectively 
the state of north carolina department of insurance has restricted upcic to writing no more than million of direct premiums in each of the first two full calendar years after which such restriction may be lifted 
in addition  upcic has filed to offer flood insurance through the nfip 
the company expects that premiums from policy renewals and new business will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital requirements beyond the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s primary areas of estimate are described below 
recognition of premium revenues 
property and liability premiums are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the policy term 
the portion of premiums that will be earned in the future are deferred and reported as unearned premiums 
the company believes that its revenue recognition policies conform to staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
insurance liabilities 
claims and claim adjustment expenses are provided for as claims are incurred 
the provision for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses includes the accumulation of individual case estimates for claims and claim adjustment expenses reported prior to the close of the accounting period  estimates for unreported claims based on industry data  and estimates of expenses for investigating and adjusting claims based on the experience of the company and the industry 
inherent in the estimates of ultimate claims are expected trends in claim severity  frequency and other factors that may vary as claims are settled 
the amount of uncertainty in the estimates for casualty coverage is significantly affected by such factors as the amount of claims experience relative to the development period  knowledge of the actual facts and circumstances and the amount of insurance risk retained 
in the case of upcic  this uncertainty is compounded by upcic s limited history of claims experience 
in addition  upcic s policyholders are currently concentrated in south florida  which is periodically subject to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms 
the methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liability are continually reviewed  and any adjustments are reflected in earnings currently 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred ceding commissions 
commissions and other costs of acquiring insurance that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies or reinsurance treaties to which they are related 
determination of costs other than commissions that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business requires estimates to allocate certain operating expenses 
as of december   deferred policy acquisition costs were  and deferred ceding commissions were  deferred ceding commissions were reduced by deferred policy acquisition costs and shown net on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of  provision for premium deficiency 
it is the company s policy to evaluate and recognize losses on insurance contracts when estimated future claims and maintenance costs under a group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and investment income 
the determination of the provision for premium deficiency requires estimation of the costs of losses  catastrophic reinsurance and policy maintenance to be incurred and investment income to be earned over the remaining policy period 
the company has determined that a provision for premium deficiency was not warranted as of december  reinsurance 
in the normal course of business  the company seeks to reduce the risk of loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
while ceding premiums to reinsurers reduces the company s risk of exposure in the event of catastrophic losses  it also reduces the company s potential for greater profits should such catastrophic events fail to occur 
the company believes that the extent of its reinsurance is typical of a company of its size in the homeowners insurance industry 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the reinsurance agreement and consistent with the establishment of the liability of the company 
the company s reinsurance policies do not relieve the company from its obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the company  consequently  allowances are established for amounts deemed uncollectible 
no such allowance was deemed necessary as of december  off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements during related parties all underwriting  rating  policy issuance  reinsurance negotiations and administration functions for upcic are performed by upcic and universal risk advisors  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
reinsurance negotiations for upcic are also performed by barc and unaffiliated third parties 
claims adjusting functions are performed by universal adjusting corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and affiliated and unaffiliated third parties 
downes and associates  a multi line insurance adjustment corporation based in deerfield beach  florida performs certain claims adjusting work for upcic 
downes and associates is owned by dennis downes  who is the father of sean p 
downes  chief operating officer and senior vice president of upcic 
during  and  the company expensed claims adjusting fees of   and  respectively  to downes and associates 
in september  the company initiated the process of acquiring all of the outstanding common stock of atlas florida financial corporation  which owned all of the outstanding common stock of sterling premium finance company  inc  from the company s chief executive officer and chief operating officer for  which approximated sterling s book value 
the company received approval of the acquisition from the oir 
sterling has been renamed atlas premium finance company and commenced offering premium finance services in november results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the year ended december  saw continued growth in policy count for upcic  the company s wholly owned regulated insurance subsidiary 
the increase in the number of policies in force continued to be the result of heightened relationships with existing agents  an increase in new agents  a new web based policy administration system  and the disruption in the marketplace following the windstorm catastrophes in and despite growth in the number of policies in force during the year ended december   the company experienced a decrease in net income in the current period primarily as a result of the effects of state mandated rate reductions and discounts  and increased losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
additionally  decreased investment income contributed to reduced earnings in the year versus the year 
net income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the company s earnings per diluted share were for the period versus in the same period last year 
in january  the florida legislature passed a law designed to reduce residential catastrophe reinsurance costs and requiring insurance companies to offer corresponding rate reductions to policyholders 
the new law expanded the amount of reinsurance available from the fhcf  which is a state run entity providing hurricane reinsurance to residential insurers at premiums less than the private reinsurance market 
the legislature intended for the new law to reduce residential insurers reinsurance costs by allowing them to directly replace some of their private market reinsurance with less costly fhcf reinsurance 
in addition  prices in the private reinsurance market have fallen as reinsurers have had capital displaced by the expanded fhcf 
upcic purchased the maximum additional coverage available to the company under the expanded fhcf  allowing upcic to maximize its cost savings from the new law 
upcic s mid rate reductions therefore reflected actual reductions in upcic s operating costs 
in addition  upcic s private reinsurance costs in and its costs in are lower than were included in its rates prior to the legislation 
florida s legislature also has implemented strategies to improve the ability of residential structures to withstand hurricanes 
new construction must meet stronger building codes  and existing homes are eligible for an inspection program that allows homeowners to determine how their homes may be upgraded to mitigate storm damage 
an increasing number of insureds are likely to qualify for insurance premium discounts as new homes are built and existing homes are retrofitted 
these premium discounts result from homes reduced vulnerability to hurricane losses due to the mitigation efforts  which upcic takes into account in its underwriting and profitability models 
gross premiums written increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  as of december  and  upcic was servicing approximately  and  respectively  homeowners and dwelling fire insurance policies with in force premiums of approximately  and  respectively 
the wind mitigation discounts mandated by the florida legislature to be effective june  for new business and august  for renewal business have had a significant effect on upcic s premium 
as of june   of upcic policyholders were receiving wind mitigation credits totaling  a reduction of in force premium 
as of december   of upcic policyholders were receiving wind mitigation credits totaling  a reduction of in force premium 
as of december   of upcic policyholders were receiving wind mitigation credits totaling  a reduction of in force premium 
net premiums earned decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to an increase in direct premiums earned net of previously discussed rate decreases and implementation of wind mitigation credits and a proportionally higher increase in ceded premiums earned related to changes in the reinsurance program as described in note reinsurance in the accompanying notes to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item below 
net investment income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a lower interest rate environment during the year ended december  commission revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  commission revenue is comprised principally of the managing general agent s policy fee income and service fee income on all new and renewal insurance policies  reinsurance commission sharing agreements  and commissions generated from agency operations 
the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in reinsurance commission sharing of approximately million  and an increase in managing general agent s policy fee income of approximately million 
other revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to fees earned on payment plans offered to policyholders by upcic 
net losses and lae increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the net loss and lae ratios  or net losses and lae as a percentage of net earned premiums  were and during the years ended december  and  respectively  and were comprised of the following components year ended december  direct ceded net loss and loss adjustment expenses premiums earned loss lae ratios year ended december  direct ceded net loss and loss adjustment expenses premiums earned loss lae ratios the direct loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the direct loss and lae ratio is attributable to the increase in direct loss and lae incurred outpacing the increase in direct earned premium in the period 
although total direct premiums earned increased in the year ended december  compared to the same period in  the average premium per policy decreased significantly due to the previously described rate decreases and wind mitigation credits 
as of december   upcic was servicing approximately  homeowners and dwelling fire insurance policies with in force premiums of approximately  or an average of  per policy 
the comparable average in force premium per policy as of december  was  consequently  the direct loss and lae ratio increased for the period 
however  except for direct incurred losses and lae of approximately million  or of direct earned premium  related to tropical storm fay in  the company s loss experience did not vary significantly during the year compared to the year 
direct incurred losses and lae related to tropical storm fay were ceded to upcic s quota share reinsurer at  or  the ceded loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the ceded loss and lae ratio was influenced by greater direct incurred loss and lae ceded under the company s quota share reinsurance treaty and higher total reinsurance costs in the period compared to the period 
although reinsurance costs have decreased  total reinsurance costs are higher as upcic purchased additional coverage in catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property liability insurance business which may contribute to material year to year fluctuations in upcic s and the company s results of operations and financial position 
during the years ended december  and  respectively  neither upcic nor the company experienced any catastrophic events 
the level of catastrophe loss experienced in any year cannot be predicted and could be material to the results of operations and financial position of upcic and the company 
while management believes upcic s and the company s catastrophe management strategies will reduce the severity of future losses  upcic and the company continue to be exposed to catastrophic losses  including catastrophic losses that may exceed the limits of the company s reinsurance program 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to several factors  including an increase in ceding commissions due to greater ceded earned premiums  an increase in corporate insurance expense  a decrease in assessment expense due to increased collections of assessments from policyholders  a decrease in executive incentive compensation and an increase in net deferred policy acquisition costs 
federal and state income taxes decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  federal and state income taxes were of pretax income for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lower income before income taxes 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the fiscal year ended december  marked a significant improvement in the company s operating results over recent past fiscal years 
this improvement was primarily attributable to volume and rate increases  restructuring the homeowners insurance coverage offered  restructuring the company s reinsurance coverage and working to control general and administrative expenses 
in addition  florida did not experience any windstorm catastrophes during net income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the company s earnings per diluted share were for the period versus for the period

gross premiums written increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in gross premiums written is primarily attributable to an increase in new business as well as premium rate increases which were mitigated by a decline in premium rates 
although rates have recently decreased  the number of policies written has continued to increase 
the increase in new business is partly attributable to the and florida windstorm catastrophes  which have provided an opportunity in the otherwise competitive marketplace as certain companies are not accepting new business  as well as marketing initiatives the company has undertaken 
net premiums earned increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in net premiums earned is attributable to an increase in new business  premium rate increases and changes in the reinsurance program noted above 
net investment income consists of net investment income and net realized gains losses

cash flows used in investing activities are primarily comprised of purchases of building improvements and other capital expenditures 
cash flows used in financing activities primarily relate to company borrowings and payment of dividends to shareholders 
in june  the company borrowed monies from two private investors and issued two promissory notes for the aggregate principal sum of  payable in monthly installments of  payment on one note commenced on june  and commenced on the other note on november  as of march   these loans were fully paid 
the loan proceeds were subsequently contributed to upcic as additional paid in capital 
in conjunction with the notes  the company granted a warrant to one of the investors to purchase  shares of restricted common stock at an exercise price of

on november   upcic entered into a million surplus note with the florida state board of administration sba under florida s insurance capital build up incentive program icbui 
under the icbui program  which was implemented by the florida legislature to encourage insurance companies to write additional residential insurance coverage in florida  the sba matched upcic s funds of million that were earmarked for participation in the program 
the surplus note brings the current capital and surplus of upcic to approximately million 
the million is invested in a treasury money market account 
the surplus note has a twenty year term and accrues interest at a rate equivalent to the year us treasury bond rate  adjusted quarterly based on the year constant maturity treasury rate 
for the first three years of the term of the surplus note  upcic is required to pay interest only  although principal payments can be made during this period 
any payment of principal or interest by upcic on the surplus note must be approved by the commissioner of the oir 
in may  the florida legislature passed a law providing participants in the icbui an opportunity to amend the terms of their surplus notes based on law changes 
the new law contains methods for calculating compliance with the writing ratio requirements that are more favorable to upcic than prior law and the prior terms of the surplus note 
on november   upcic and the sba executed an addendum to the surplus note addendum that reflects these law changes 
the terms of the addendum were effective july  in addition to other less significant changes  the addendum modifies the definitions of minimum required surplus  minimum writing ratio  surplus  and gross written premium  as defined in the original surplus note 
prior to the execution of the addendum  upcic was in compliance with each of the loan s covenants as implemented by rules promulgated by the sba 
upcic currently remains in compliance with each of the loan s covenants as implemented by rules promulgated by the sba 
an event of default will occur under the surplus note  as amended  if upcic i defaults in the payment of the surplus note  ii drops below a net written premium to surplus of for three consecutive quarters beginning january  and drops below a gross written premium to surplus ratio of for three consecutive quarters beginning january   iii fails to submit quarterly filings to the oir  iv fails to maintain at least million of surplus during the term of the surplus note  except for certain situations  v misuses proceeds of the surplus note  vi makes any misrepresentations in the application for the program  vii pays any dividend when principal or interest payments are past due under the surplus note  or viii fails to maintain a level of surplus sufficient to cover in excess of upcic s in year probable maximum loss as determined by a hurricane loss model accepted by the florida commission on hurricane loss projection methodology as certified by the oir annually 
the original surplus note provided for increases in interest rates for failure to meet the minimum writing ratio 
under the terms of the surplus note agreement  at december   the interest rate on the note was increased by basis points 
as of june   the additional interest rate on the note was decreased from basis points to basis points 
under the terms of the surplus note  as amended  the net written premium to surplus requirement and gross written premium to surplus requirement have been modified 
as of december   upcic s net written premium to surplus ratio and gross written premium to surplus ratio were in excess of the required minimums and  therefore  upcic was not subject to increases in interest rates 
to meet its matching obligation under the icbui program  on november   the company entered into a secured promissory note with benfield greig holdings  inc in the aggregate principal amount of million 
interest on the note accrued at the rate of per annum 
the outstanding principal was due in six monthly installments of million and a final seventh monthly installment of the remaining balance plus all accrued interest under the terms of the note starting on january  and ending on july  in connection with the loan  the company and its subsidiaries appointed benfield inc as their reinsurance intermediary for all of their reinsurance placements for the contract year beginning on june  the company made all payments in a timely manner and paid the final installment on july  under the terms of the secured promissory note  benfield greig holdings  inc agreed to refund a portion of the interest paid on the note if the company fulfilled all its material obligations under the related broker agreements 
on july   the company received a refund of interest from benfield greig holdings  inc in the amount of  that reduced the effective interest rate on the note to per annum 
there can be no assurance that the above described transactions will be sufficient to ensure upcic s future compliance with florida insurance laws and regulations  or that the company will be able to maintain profitability 
failure by upcic to maintain the required level of statutory capital and surplus could result in the suspension of upcic s authority to write new or renewal business  other regulatory actions or ultimately  in the revocation of upcic s certificate of authority by the oir 
the following table represents the company s total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable 
in thousands total less than year years years over years long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations on november   upcic entered into a million surplus note with the florida state board of administration sba under the icbui program 
the surplus note has a twenty year term and accrues interest at a rate equivalent to the year us treasury bond rate  adjusted quarterly based on the year constant maturity treasury rate 
for the first three years of the term of the surplus note  upcic is required to pay interest only  although principal payments can be made during this period 
any payment of principal or interest by upcic on the surplus note must be approved by the commissioner of the oir 
the first scheduled principal payment is due january  the balance of cash and cash equivalents as of december  was  most of this amount is available to pay claims in the event of a catastrophic event pending reimbursement for any aggregate amount in excess of specific limits set forth in upcic s reinsurance agreements 
for the hurricane season  upcic s reinsurance agreements transfer the risk of loss in excess of  up to approximately the year pml for the first event   for the second event and  for the third event up to an amount that will vary depending on the coverage exhausted in the prior event s 
catastrophic reinsurance is recoverable upon presentation to the reinsurer of evidence of claim payment 
on june   the company s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  of its shares of outstanding common stock 
under the repurchase program  management was authorized to repurchase shares through december   with block trades permitted  in open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements 
to facilitate repurchases  the company made purchases pursuant to a rule b plan  which allowed the company to repurchase its shares during periods when it otherwise might have been prevented from doing so under insider trading laws 
in total  the company repurchased  shares under its repurchase plan at an aggregate cost of  on august   the company announced the completion of the repurchase program 
gaap differs in some respects from reporting practices prescribed or permitted by the oir 
to retain its certificate of authority  the florida insurance laws and regulations require that upcic maintain capital and surplus equal to the statutory minimum capital and surplus requirement defined in the florida insurance code as the greater of of the insurer s total liabilities or  upcic s statutory capital and surplus was  at december  and exceeded the minimum capital and surplus requirements 
upcic is also required to adhere to prescribed premium to capital surplus ratios 
the maximum amount of dividends  which can be paid by florida insurance companies without prior approval of the commissioner of the oir  is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus 
the maximum dividend that may be paid by upcic to the company without prior approval is limited to the lesser of statutory net income from operations of the preceding calendar year or statutory unassigned surplus as of the preceding year end 
statutory unassigned surplus at december  was  during the year ended december   upcic declared and paid aggregate dividends to the company of  during and  upcic did not pay dividends to the company 
upcic is required annually to comply with the naic risk based capital rbc requirements 
rbc requirements prescribe a method of measuring the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
naic s rbc requirements are used by regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers who show signs of weak or deteriorating condition 
as of december   based on calculations using the appropriate naic rbc formula  upcic s reported total adjusted capital was in excess of the requirements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary assets of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the cost of paying losses and lae 
insurance premiums are established before the company knows the amount of loss and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses 
consequently  the company attempts to anticipate the future impact of inflation when establishing rate levels 
while the company attempts to charge adequate rates  the company may be limited in raising its premium levels for competitive and regulatory reasons 
inflation also affects the market value of the company s investment portfolio and the investment rate of return 
any future economic changes which result in prolonged and increasing levels of inflation could cause increases in the dollar amount of incurred loss and lae and thereby materially adversely affect future liability requirements
