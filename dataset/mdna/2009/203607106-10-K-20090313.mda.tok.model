item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a primarily reviews the financial condition and results of operations of community bank system  inc the company for the past two years  although in some circumstances a period longer than two years is covered in order to comply with securities and exchange commission disclosure requirements or to more fully explain long term trends 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information on page and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear on pages through all references in the discussion to the financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
unless otherwise noted  all earnings per share eps figures disclosed in the md a refer to diluted eps  interest income  net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis 
the term this year and equivalent terms refer to results in calendar year  last year and equivalent terms refer to calendar year  and all references to income statement results correspond to full year activity unless otherwise noted 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of community bank system  inc these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies as a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the company s business  management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations 
the policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted accounting principles gaap  but also reflects on management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the company s financial performance 
it is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance  or the level of subjectivity in the selection process 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the critical accounting estimates include allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses in the company s loan portfolio 
determination of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective 
it requires significant estimates including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans which is based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
investment securities investment securities are classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on the company s ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  as a separate component of shareholders equity and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments  or a discounted cash flow model using market estimates of interest rates and volatility 
marketable investment securities with significant declines in fair value are evaluated to determine whether they should be considered other than temporarily impaired 
impairment losses must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income or loss 
actuarial assumptions associated with pension  post retirement and other employee benefit plans these assumptions include discount rate  rate of future compensation increases and expected return on plan assets 
specific discussion of the assumptions used by management is discussed in note k on pages through provision for income taxes the company is subject to examinations from various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions 
management believes that the assumptions and judgments used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate 
should tax laws change or the taxing authorities determine that management s assumptions were inappropriate  an adjustment may be required which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
a summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  starting on page executive summary the company s business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision making  principally in non metropolitan markets  providing a broad array of banking and financial services to retail  commercial  and municipal customers 
the company s core operating objectives are i grow the branch network  primarily through a disciplined acquisition strategy  and certain selective de novo expansions  ii build profitable loan and deposit volume using both organic and acquisition strategies  iii increase the non interest income component of total revenues through development of banking related fee income  growth in existing financial services business units  and the acquisition of additional financial services and banking businesses  and iv utilize technology to deliver customer responsive products and services and to reduce operating costs 
significant factors management reviews to evaluate achievement of the company s operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to net income and earnings per share  return on assets and equity  net interest margins  noninterest income  operating expenses  asset quality  loan and deposit growth  capital management  performance of individual banking and financial services units  performance of specific product lines  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity  enhancements to customer products and services  technology advancements  market share  peer comparisons  and the performance of acquisition and integration activities 
the company s reported net income for the year of million  or per share  was above s reported earnings of million  or per share 
the results were driven by strong organic loan and core deposit growth  continued expansion of non interest revenues  improved net interest margin  and continued solid asset quality 
the company also recorded a million benefit related to a change in certain previously unrecognized tax positions 
these results were partially offset by a million non cash charge for impairment of goodwill associated with one of the company s wealth management businesses  as well as million of acquisition expenses related to the purchase of branch banking centers in northern new york state from citizens in november and the purchase of abg in july 
last year s results included a million benefit related to the settlement and a related change in certain previously unrecognized tax positions  and a million pretax charge related to the early redemption of million of variable rate  trust preferred obligations  and the refinancing of million of federal home loan bank advances into lower cost instruments 
asset quality remained favorable in  with increases in the loan charge off  delinquency and nonperforming loan ratios as well as a higher provision for loan losses versus  but still below long term historical levels 
the company experienced year over year loan growth in all portfolios consumer installment  consumer mortgage and business lending  due to both the citizens branch acquisition and strong organic loan growth 
the investment portfolio  including cash equivalents  increased from the prior year due to the net liquidity created from the acquisition of citizens branches in the fourth quarter 
average deposits increased in as compared to as the result of the acquisition of citizens branches as well as organic growth in core product relationships  offset by a reduction in time deposits 
external borrowings decreased from the end of december as a portion of the net liquidity from the branch acquisition was used to eliminate short term obligations 
while the company reported improved earnings for  it anticipates that current global economic conditions and challenges in the financial services industry may negatively impact earnings in in particular  the company expects that in premiums paid to the fdic will increase significantly  pension and postretirement expenses will increase significantly  revenue from fhlb dividends may decrease  payments representing interest and principal on currently outstanding loans and investments will most likely be reinvested at rates that are lower than the rates on currently outstanding loans and investments and the economy may have an adverse affect on asset quality indicators and the provision for loan losses  and therefore credit costs  which have trended higher in  are not expected to decline until economic indicators improve 
due to current uncertainty in economic conditions and the financial services industry in general  it is particularly difficult to estimate certain revenue  expenses  and other related matters 
there may be factors in addition to those identified above that impact results 
for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could impact the company s future results  see item a 
risk factors 
net income and profitability net income for was million  up million  or  from s earnings of million 
earnings per share for was per share  up from s earnings per share 
the results include a million or per share benefit related to a change in a position taken on certain previously unrecognized tax positions 
the results also include a million or per share non cash charge for impairment of goodwill associated with the company s wealth management business and million or per share of acquisition expenses related to the purchase of branch banking centers in northern new york sate from citizens in november and the purchase of abg in july 
in addition to the earnings results presented above in accordance with gaap  the company provides cash earnings per share which excludes the after tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets  the market value adjustments on net assets acquired in mergers  and the noncash portion of debt extinguishments costs 
management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity and certain noncash transactions in reported results

average loans grew million or  primarily due to strong business lending  consumer installment and retail mortgage growth as well as the addition of branch banking centers in november  and tlnb in june average investments decreased million  or in short term cash equivalents also decreased million as compared to average borrowings increased million due to the need to supplement the funding of strong organic loan growth and provide temporary financing for investment purchases made in advance of the significant amount of liquidity that was provided by the citizens acquisition 
the loan loss provision of million increased million  or  from the prior year level 
net charge offs of million increased by million from  increasing the net charge off ratio net charge offs total average loans to for the year 
the company s asset quality remained strong as key metrics such as nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans  nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned  and delinquent loans days through nonaccruing as a percentage of total loans increased but remained below long term historical levels 
additional information on trends and policy related to asset quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages through noninterest income for of million increased by million  or  from s level  due both to organic growth and the acquisitions of the citizens branches  abg  hbt and tlnb 
noninterest income for included a million debt refinancing charge  comprised of the refinance of certain federal home loan bank advances and the early redemption of million of trust preferred securities 
fees from banking services were up million or  primarily due to several revenue enhancement initiatives implemented over the last two years  as well as the acquisitions completed in and financial services revenue was up million  or higher  mostly from strong growth at the company s benefit plan administration and consulting business and the acquisition of abg and hbt 
total operating expenses increased million or in to million 
a significant portion of the increase was primarily attributable to incremental operating expenses related to the citizens branches  abg  tlnb and hbt acquisitions 
additionally  expenses were up due to annual merit and other personnel costs  higher fdic insurance premiums  higher facility based utility and maintenance costs  higher volume based processing costs  and increased expenses related to investments in the technology and facilities infrastructure 
the company s combined effective federal and state income tax rate increased percentage points in to primarily as a result of a smaller settlement of certain previously unrecognized tax positions as compared to the previous year 
selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows table selected ratios return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets as displayed in table above  the return on average assets increased in as compared to both and the increase in comparison to both years was a result of higher net income primarily due to solid organic growth and the and acquisitions 
reported return on equity in was also higher than and s levels for similar reasons 
the dividend payout ratio for was above s level due to dividends declared increasing  versus the growth in net income 
the increase in dividends declared was the result of a increase in the dividend paid per share as well as the additional million shares issued during the common equity offering in the fourth quarter 
the dividend payout ratio decreased in as compared to due to a larger increase in net income than the increase in dividends declared 
net interest income net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  which consists primarily of interest paid to the company s depositors and interest on external borrowings 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
as disclosed in table  net interest income with nontaxable income converted to a fully tax equivalent basis totaled million in  up million  or  from the prior year 
a million increase in average interest earning assets and an basis point increase in net interest margin more than offset a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
as reflected in table  the higher net interest margin had a million favorable impact  and the volume changes mentioned above increased net interest income by million 
the net interest margin increased basis points from in to in this increase was primarily attributable to a basis point decrease in the cost of funds having a greater impact than the basis point decrease in earning asset yields 
the decreased cost of funds was reflective of disciplined deposit pricing  in part due to the decreases in short term market rates in  as well as planned reductions of time deposit balances 
additionally  the rates on external borrowings decreased throughout the year  as a result of the refinancing of million of federal home loan bank advances into lower cost instruments in the fourth quarter of and seven rate reductions by the federal reserve to the overnight federal funds rates since the end of the yield on loans decreased basis points in  again due in part to the declining interest rates throughout the market 
the yield on investments decreased from in to in as cash flows from the maturing of higher yielding investments were used to fund loan growth rather than be reinvested at unfavorable market rates in the first half of the year  as well as the steep decline in yields earned on cash equivalents 
in the second half of the year  the company purchased investments in advance of the liquidity provided by the acquisition of the citizens branches in november the net interest margin in was  compared to in this basis point decline was primarily attributable to a basis point increase in the cost of funds having a greater impact than the nine basis point increase in earning asset yields 
the increased cost of funds was due to rising rates on deposit products  primarily time deposits in the first three quarters of the year  as the rates on new volume were above those of maturing time deposits  in part due to increases in short term market rates in and the rates on external borrowings decreased throughout the year  as a result of the early redemption of fixed rate trust preferred securities in the first quarter of and four rate reductions by the federal reserve to the overnight federal funds rates during the later half of the yield on loans increased basis points in the yield on investments decreased from in to in due mostly to a leveraging strategy undertaken in mid  as well as declines in short and medium term rates in the second half of the year 
as shown in table  total interest income decreased by million  or  in table reveals that higher average earning assets contributed a positive million variance offset by lower yields with a negative impact of million 
average loans grew a total of million in  as a result of million from the acquisitions of citizens branches in november and tlnb in june as well as million of organic growth in all portfolios business lending  consumer mortgage and consumer installment 
interest and fees were consistent with  attributable to higher average loan balances offset by a basis point decrease in loan yields 
total interest income increased by million  or in from s level 
table indicates that higher average earning assets contributed a positive million variance and higher yields contributed million 
average loans grew million in over  as a result of million from the acquisitions of tlnb in june  onb in december and elmira in august and million of organic growth in the consumer mortgage and consumer installment portfolios 
interest and fees on loans increased million  or  in as compared to the increase was attributable to higher average loan balances  as well as a basis point increase in loan yields due to increases in short term rates in the first half of the year 
investment interest income in of million was million  or  lower than the prior year as a result of a smaller portfolio negative million impact  and a basis point decrease in the investment yield 
the decrease in balances was a result of cash flows from maturing investments being used to fund loan growth rather than be reinvested at unfavorable market rates 
investment purchases were initiated in the third and fourth quarters of in anticipation of the net liquidity that would be supplied by the citizens branch acquisition 
investment interest income in of million was million  or  higher than the prior year as a result of a larger portfolio positive million impact 
the performance of the investment portfolio in and remained strong despite the interest rate environment 
during the third quarter of  a million short term investment leverage strategy was initiated  which produced positive net interest income and served to demonstrate the company s ability to freely access liquidity sources despite tightened credit market conditions 
the average earning asset yield declined basis points to in because of the previously mentioned decreases in loan and investment yields 
in  the gap between loan and investment yields decreased to basis points as the yield on the loan portfolio decreased basis points while the yield on the investment portfolio decreased a smaller basis points reflective of the loan portfolio having a significant proportion of variable and adjustable rate loans which declined as the interest rates decreased throughout  whereas the investment portfolio was predominately comprised of fixed rate instruments 
the average earning asset yield grew nine basis points to in from in during  changes in market interest rates combined with the strategic investment portfolio actions previously discussed resulted in the yield on the loan portfolio being higher than the investment portfolio by basis points 
this gap widened in as the yield on the loan portfolio expanded and the investment portfolio yield stabilized resulting in loan yields being basis points higher than the yield on the investment portfolio 
total average funding deposits and borrowings in increased million or 
deposits increased million  million attributable to the acquisitions of the citizens branches and tlnb offset by a million decrease in organic deposits 
consistent with the company s funding mix objective  average core deposit balances increased million  while time deposits were allowed to decline million over the year 
average external borrowings increased million in as compared to the prior year due primarily to the all cash acquisitions of abg  tlnb and hbt 
however  year end borrowings declined million from the end of as a portion of the net liquidity from the branch acquisition was used to eliminate short term borrowings 
in  total average funding increased million or 
deposits increased million  million attributable to the acquisitions of tlnb  onb and elmira and million due to organic deposit growth 
average external borrowings increased million in as compared to the prior year due primarily to the incremental leverage strategy implemented in the third quarter of the cost of funding decreased basis points during impacted by the decreases to short term rates by the federal reserve throughout the latter part of and all of interest rates on deposit accounts were lowered throughout  with decreases in all product offerings 
additionally  the company s focus on expanding core account relationships while time deposit balances were allowed to decline 
this trend is demonstrated by the percentage of average deposits that were in time deposit accounts decreasing from in to in  while noninterest checking deposits  interest bearing checking deposits and money market accounts increased from  and  respectively  in  to  and  respectively  in the prepayment of trust preferred securities and federal home loan bank advances from early through early contributed to the decrease in the interest rate differential between short and long term debt instruments over the past two years 
total interest expense decreased by million to million in as shown in table  lower interest rates on deposits and external borrowings resulted in million of this decrease  while the higher deposit and borrowings balances accounted for an increase of million in interest expense 
interest expense as a percentage of earning assets decreased by basis points to 
the rate on interest bearing deposits decreased basis points to  due largely to decreases in time deposits and money market rates throughout and the previously discussed run off of higher rate deposit products 
the rate on external borrowings decreased basis points to because of the refinancing of million of federal home loan bank advances into lower cost instruments at the end of as well as the favorable rates on borrowings throughout total interest expense increased by million to million in as compared to higher interest rates accounted million of the increase  while the higher deposit and borrowing balances accounted for million of the increase in interest expense 
the rate on interest bearing deposits increased basis points to and the rate on external borrowings decreased basis points to in the following table sets forth information related to average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and their associated yields and rates for the years ended december   and interest income and yields are on a fully tax equivalent basis using marginal income tax rates of in  in  and in average balances are computed by totaling the daily ending balances in a period and dividing by the number of days in that period

noninterest income the company s sources of noninterest income are of three primary types general banking services related to loans  deposits and other core customer activities typically provided through the branch network  financial services  comprised of employee benefit plan administration  actuarial and consulting services generated by bpas which includes bpa  harbridge and hbt  trust services  investment and insurance products generated by cisi and cbna insurance  asset management generated by nottingham  and periodic transactions  most often net gains losses from the sale of investments and prepayment of debt instruments

the loss on the sale of investment securities and debt extinguishments decreased million in as included a one time million charge related to the early redemption of million of variable rate trust preferred obligations  as well as the refinance of million of federal home loan bank advances into lower cost instruments with no corresponding loss in refer to the investments section of the md a on pages through for further information 
total noninterest income  excluding security gains and debt extinguishments costs  of million for increased by over  largely as a result of higher utilization of bank services and growth at bpas both organically and from the acquisition of hbt in may the loss on the sale of investment securities and debt extinguishments increased million in  which included the one time debt refinancing discussed above  while included a million charge related to the early retirement of million of fixed rate trust preferred securities 
noninterest income as a percent of operating income fte basis was in  up percentage points from the prior year 
excluding the gain loss on investment securities and debt extinguishments  noninterest income as a percent of operating income fte basis was in  a percentage point increase from for this increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned strong growth in recurring bank fees and bpas income  partially offset by the favorable impact the basis point increase in the net interest margin had on net interest income 
this ratio is considered an important measure for determining the progress the company is making on one of its primary long term strategies  which is the expansion of noninterest income in order to diversify its revenue sources and reduce reliance on net interest margins that may be strongly impacted by general interest rate and other market conditions 
the largest portion of the company s recurring noninterest income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  which reached million in  up from the prior year 
a large portion of the income growth was attributable to electronic banking fees  up million  or  over s level  due in large part to a concerted effort to increase the penetration and utilization of consumer debit cards 
overdraft fees were also up million  or  over s level  driven by core deposit account growth 
mortgage banking fees decreased million  or in fees from general banking services were million in  up million or from  primarily driven by growth in overdraft fees  commissions and electronic banking  generated from several revenue enhancement initiatives and core deposit account growth 
as disclosed in table  noninterest income from financial services including revenues from benefit plan administration  consulting and actuarial fees and wealth management services rose million  or  in to million 
financial services revenue now comprises of total noninterest income  excluding net gains losses on the sale of investment securities and debt extinguishments 
strong performance at bpas generated revenue growth of million  or  for the year  achieved primarily through the acquisition of abg in july and hbt in may  new product offerings and expanded market coverage 
bpas offers their clients daily valuation  actuarial and employee benefit consulting services on a national basis from offices in upstate new york  texas  and pennsylvania

assets under management increased billion during from billion at year end market driven gains in equity based assets were augmented by attraction of new client assets and the acquisition of hbt 
bpa  in particular  was successful at growing its asset base  as demonstrated by the approximately million increase in its assets under administration during  excluding assets added through the acquisition of hbt 
in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a million charge related to the early redemption of its million  variable rate trust preferred obligations  which included a premium call provision at 
additionally  the company incurred a million charge to refinance million of federal home loan bank advances into similar duration  lower cost instruments 
in the company incurred a million charge related to the early redemption of its million  fixed rate trust preferred obligations  which included a premium call provision at 
the security and debt gains and losses taken over the last three years are illustrative of the company s active management of its investment portfolio and external borrowings to achieve a desirable total return through the combination of net interest income  transaction gains losses and changes in market value across financial market cycles  as well as achieving an appropriate interest rate sensitivity profile in changing rate environments 
operating expenses as shown in table  operating expenses increased million  or  in to million primarily due to the four acquisitions completed in and  as well as a goodwill impairment charge on the wealth management businesses  and higher merit based personnel expenses  fdic insurance premiums  and volume based processing costs

operating expenses for as a percent of average assets were  up basis points from in excluding the goodwill impairment and acquisition expenses  operating expenses as a percent of average assets would be 
this ratio is impacted by the comparatively high growth rates of the financial service businesses  which are less asset intensive and consequently carry higher expense to asset ratios 
the efficiency ratio  a performance measurement tool widely used by banks  is defined by the company as operating expenses excluding special charges acquisition expenses  goodwill impairment and intangible amortization divided by operating income fully tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities and debt gains and losses 
lower ratios are often correlated to higher efficiency 
in the efficiency ratio improved percentage points to due to an increase in net interest income and a increase in noninterest income excluding net securities gains and debt extinguishments costs having a greater impact than a increase in operating expenses 
the efficiency ratio for was percentage points higher than the ratio for due to a increase in operating expenses having a greater impact than a increase in net interest income and a increase in noninterest income excluding net securities gains and debt extinguishments costs 
in  operating income growth was inhibited by the contraction of the net interest margin 
in addition  the efficiency ratios for both periods were adversely affected by the growing proportion of financial services activities  which due to the differing nature of their business carry high efficiency ratios

if the final resolution of taxes payable differs from its estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions  adjustments to tax expense may be required 
the effective tax rate for increased percentage points to 
there were two notable items during  which impacted the effective tax rate for the year 
upon settlement of open tax years with certain taxing authorities  the company recorded million of previously unrecognized tax benefits  as compared to a million benefit recognized in additionally  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge related to its wealth management businesses  reducing pre tax net income 
the effective tax rate for decreased by percentage points to as a result of the aforementioned million benefit related to the settlement and a related change in a position taken on certain previously unrecognized tax positions and a higher proportion of tax exempt income  due in part to the higher debt restructuring charges in capital shareholders equity ended at million  up million  or  from one year earlier 
this increase reflects net income of million  million from the issuance of shares through employee stock plans  million from stock based compensation and million from a common stock offering 
these increases were partially offset by common stock dividends declared of million and a million decrease in other comprehensive income 
the other comprehensive income is comprised of a million increase in the market value adjustment mva  represents the after tax  unrealized change in value of available for sale securities in the company s investment portfolio  a million charge based on the funded status of the company s employee retirement plans  and a million decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedges 
excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both and  capital rose by million  or 
shares outstanding increased by  during the year  comprised of  added through the common stock offering in the fourth quarter and  added through employee stock plans 
shareholders equity ended at  up million  or from one year earlier 
this increase reflects net income of million  million from the issuance of shares through employee stock plans  million from stock based compensation and a million increase in other comprehensive income 
these increases were partially offset by common stock dividends declared of million and treasury share purchases of million 
the other comprehensive income is comprised of a million increase in the mva  a million benefit based on the funded status of the company s employee retirement plans  partially offset by a million decrease in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedges 
the company s ratio of tier capital to assets or tier leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum for an institution to be considered well capitalized  decreased basis points at year end to 
this was primarily the result of a increase in average assets due to the acquisitions of tlnb and the citizens branches  as well as organic loan growth  while tangible equity declined due to the intangible assets added in association with the two acquisitions made in abg and citizens branches 
the tangible equity tangible assets ratio was at the end of versus one year earlier 
the decline was due to intangible assets from the acquisition of abg and the citizens branches  having a proportionally greater impact on tangible equity than on tangible assets 
the company manages organic and acquired growth in a manner that enables it to continue to build upon its strong capital base  and maintain the company s ability to take advantage of future strategic growth opportunities 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth was mostly a result of dividends per share of for increasing from in  a result of quarterly dividends per share being raised from to in the third quarter of and from to in the third quarter of contributing to the increase in the dividend was the million shares issued in the common equity offering completed in the fourth quarter of the dividend payout ratio for this year was compared to in  and in in the increase in dividends paid was slightly larger than the increase in net income 
the change in is a result of the increase in dividends declared being smaller than the increase in net income 
liquidity liquidity risk is measured by the company s ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost and minimize any loss 
the company must be capable of meeting all obligations to its customers at any time and  therefore  the active management of its liquidity position is critical 
given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as the company s desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  the company must have available adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows  liquidity must be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank  and the federal reserve bank 
other funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time  including wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  large certificates of deposit  and brokered cd relationships 
the company s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the amount of cash that could be made available within days calculated as liquid assets less short term liabilities as a percentage of total assets  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
as of december   this ratio was and for the respective time periods  excluding the company s capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank and other sources  as compared to the bank policy that requires a minimum of 
at december  there is million in additional federal home loan bank borrowing capacity based on the company s year end collateral levels 
additionally  the company has million in unused capacity at the federal reserve bank and million in unused capacity from unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks 
in addition to the and day basic surplus deficit model  longer term liquidity over a minimum of five years is measured and a liquidity analysis projecting sources and uses of funds is prepared 
to measure longer term liquidity  a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time 
this five year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan growth over the next five years 
though remote  the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions 
accordingly  management has addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan  which has been reviewed and approved by both the board of directors and the company s asset liability management committee 
the plan addresses those actions the company would take in response to both a short term and long term funding crisis 
a short term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system  either internal or external  which disrupts orderly short term funding operations 
such a crisis should be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings 
a long term funding crisis would most likely be the result of drastic credit deterioration at the company 
management believes that both circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events 
intangible assets the changes in intangible assets by reporting segment for the year ended december  are summarized as follows table a intangible assets balance at balance at december  additions amortization impairment december  banking segment goodwill other intangibles core deposit intangibles total other segment goodwill other intangibles total intangible assets at the end of totaled million  an increase of million from the prior year end due to million of additional intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of citizens and abg  and minor adjustments to the intangible assets from prior acquisitions  offset by million of amortization during the year and the million charge taken for impairment of goodwill associated with the wealth management businesses 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  core deposit value and customer relationships arising from acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill at december  amounted to million  comprised of million related to banking acquisitions and million arising from the acquisition of financial services businesses 
goodwill is subjected to periodic impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net assets exceeds their fair value  which would necessitate a write down of the goodwill 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analyses during the first quarters of and and no adjustments were necessary on the whole bank and branch acquisitions 
the impairment analysis was based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
management believes that there is a low probability of future impairment with regard to the goodwill associated with whole bank and branch acquisitions 
the performance of nottingham previously elias asset management weakened subsequent to its acquisition in as a result of adverse market conditions 
its operating performance stabilized in and improved in and early  however  significant declines in the equity markets experienced in resulted in meaningful revenue declines 
as a result management determined that a triggering event had occurred and therefore the nottingham goodwill was tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of based on the goodwill valuation performed in the fourth quarter of the company recognized an impairment charge and wrote down the carrying value of the goodwill by million to million 
additional declines in nottingham s operating results may cause future impairment to its remaining goodwill balance 
core deposit intangibles represent the value of non time deposits acquired in excess of funding that could have been purchased in the capital markets 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or straight line basis over periods ranging from seven to twenty years 
the recognition of customer relationship intangibles arose due to the acquisitions of abg  hbt and harbridge 
these assets were determined based on a methodology that calculates the present value of the projected future net income derived from the acquired customer base 
these assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over periods ranging from ten to twelve years 
loans the company s loans outstanding  by type  as of december are as follows table loans outstanding s omitted consumer mortgage business lending consumer installment gross loans allowance for loans loans  net of allowance for loan losses as disclosed in table above  gross loans outstanding reached a record level of billion as of year end  up million or compared to twelve months earlier 
the acquisition of the citizens branches accounted for million of the growth 
excluding the impact of the citizens branch and tlnb acquisitions  total loans rose million or 
the organic loan growth was produced in the business lending  consumer mortgage and consumer installment portfolios 
the compounded annual growth rate cagr for the company s total loan portfolio between and was comprised of approximately organic growth  with the remainder coming from acquisitions 
the greatest overall expansion occurred in the consumer installment segment  which grew at an cagr including the impact of acquisitions over that time frame 
consumer installment loans consist of home equity and personal loans as well as borrowings originated in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships 
the consumer mortgage segment grew at a compounded annual growth rate of from to the consumer mortgage growth was primarily driven by record mortgage refinancing volumes over the last five years  as well as the acquisition of consumer oriented banks and branches in that time period 
the business lending segment grew at a compounded annual growth rate of from to the weighting of the components of the company s loan portfolio enables it to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding at the end of were made to consumers borrowing on an installment  line of credit or residential mortgage loan basis 
the business lending portfolio is also broadly diversified by industry type as demonstrated by the following distributions at year end commercial real estate  healthcare  general services  retail trade  construction  agriculture  manufacturing  motor vehicle and parts dealers  restaurant lodging  and wholesale trade 
a variety of other industries with less than a share of the total portfolio comprise the remaining 
the consumer mortgage portion of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of fixed and adjustable rate residential lending 
consumer mortgages increased million or in excluding the impact of the citizens branch  and tlnb acquisitions  the consumer mortgage portfolio was up million or in consumer mortgage growth increased over the last year in part due to heightened refinancing activity due to a decline in long term interest rates 
the consumer real estate portfolio does not include exposure to subprime  alt a  or other higher risk mortgage products 
the company s solid performance during a tumultuous period in the overall industry is a reflection of the stable  low risk profile of its portfolio and its ability to successfully meet customer needs at a time when some national mortgage lenders are restricting their lending activities in many of the company s markets 
interest rates and expected duration continue to be the most significant factors in determining whether the company chooses to retain versus sell and service portions of its new mortgage production 
the combined total of general purpose business lending  including agricultural related and dealer floor plans  as well as mortgages on commercial property is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
the business lending portfolio increased million or in excluding the impact of the citizens branch and tlnb acquisitions  this segment increased million or as compared to the prior year 
the organic growth generated in was contributed by every major product line within business lending 
the intensity of competition the company faces in some of its markets has eased somewhat due to a portion of the banks reducing their lending participation due to liquidity and capital restraints they may be facing 
the company maintains its commitment to generating growth in its business portfolio in a manner that adheres to its twin goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable margins 
the company has continued to invest in additional personnel  technology and business development resources to further strengthen its capabilities in this key business segment 
consumer installment loans  both those originated directly such as personal loans and home equity loans and lines of credit  and indirectly originated predominantly in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships  rose million or from one year ago 
excluding the impact of the citizens branch and tlnb acquisitions  this segment increased million or 
declines in manufacturer production and industry sale projections indicate continued weakness in the new vehicle market which has created demand in late model used and program car inventories  segments in which the company is an active participant 
past business development efforts have created opportunities to strategically expand the company s share of the market  helping drive productive growth in this portfolio 
the company will continue to focus more of its efforts on maintaining the solid profitability produced by its in market and contiguous indirect portfolio  while striving to expand its dealer network modestly 
the following table shows the maturities and type of interest rates for business and construction loans as of december  table maturity distribution of business and construction loans s omitted maturing in one year or less maturing after one but within five years maturing after five years commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total fixed or predetermined interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates total scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due

as shown in table above  nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans  accruing loans days or more past due and restructured loans ended at million  up approximately million from one year earlier and consistent with the level 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans increased eight basis points from the prior year to 
the ratio of nonperforming assets which includes other real estate owned  or oreo  in addition to nonperforming loans to total loans plus oreo increased to at year end  up nine basis points from one year earlier 
the company s success at keeping these ratios at favorable levels despite deteriorating economic conditions was the result of continued focus on maintaining strict underwriting standards  and enhanced collection and recovery efforts 
had nonaccrual loans for the year ended december  been current in accordance with their original terms  additional interest income of approximately million would have been recorded 
at year end  the company was managing oreo properties with a value of million  as compared to oreo properties with a value of million a year earlier 
no single property has a carrying value in excess of  this trend also reflects the low level of foreclosure activity in the company s markets and its specific portfolio in comparison to national markets 
total delinquencies  defined as loans days or more past due or in nonaccrual status  finished the current year at of total loans outstanding versus at the end of as of year end  total delinquency ratios for commercial loans  consumer loans  and real estate mortgages were   and  respectively 
these measures were  and  respectively  as of december  delinquency levels  particularly in the to days category  tend to be somewhat volatile due to their measurement at a point in time  and therefore management believes that it is useful to evaluate this ratio over a longer period 
the average quarter end delinquency ratio for total loans in was  as compared to an average of in and in the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is as follows table allowance for loan loss activity years ended december  s omitted except for ratios allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs business lending consumer mortgage consumer installment total charge offs recoveries business lending consumer mortgage consumer installment total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance on acquired loans allowance for loan losses at end of period amount of loans outstanding at end of period daily average amount of loans net of unearned discount net charge offs average loans outstanding this reserve addition is attributable to loans acquired from citizens in  tlnb in  elmira and onb in  and first heritage bank in as displayed in table above  total net charge offs in were million  up million from the prior year  principally due to higher levels of charge offs in the business lending and consumer installment portfolios  partially offset by a decrease in the consumer mortgage portfolio 
net charge offs in were million below s level  principally due to significantly improved results in the business lending and consumer installment portfolios  partially offset by a slight increase in consumer mortgage net charge offs 
due to the significant increases in average loan balances over time due to acquisition and organic growth  management believes that net charge offs as a percent of average loans net charge off ratio offers a more meaningful representation of asset quality trends 
the net charge off ratio for was up ten basis points from s historically low level of 
recovery performance remained strong in gross charge offs as a percentage of average loans was in as compared to in and in continued strong recovery efforts were evidenced by recoveries of million in  representing of average gross charge offs for the latest two years  compared to in and in business loan net charge offs increased in  totaling million or of average business loans outstanding versus million or in the higher net charge off ratio in was primarily attributable to two specific commercial relationships 
consumer installment loan net charge offs increased to million this year from million in  increasing the net charge off ratio basis points to 
consumer mortgage net charge offs decreased million to million in  and the net charge off ratio declined two basis points to 
management continually evaluates the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan loss adequacy on a quarterly basis 
the two primary components of the loan review process that are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss allocations 
measurement of specific loan loss allocations is typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans greater than million are evaluated for specific loan loss allocations  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
consumer mortgages and consumer installment loans are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
the second component of the allowance establishment process  general loan loss allocations  is composed of two calculations that are computed on the four main loan segments business lending  consumer direct  consumer indirect and residential real estate 
the first calculation determines an allowance level based on the latest three years of historical net charge off data for each loan category commercial loans exclude balances with specific loan loss allocations 
the second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration five major factors affecting the level of loan loss risk portfolio risk migration patterns internal credit quality trends  the growth of the segments of the loan portfolio  economic and business environment trends in the company s markets includes review of bankruptcy  unemployment  population  consumer spending and regulatory trends  industry  geographical and product concentrations in the portfolio  and the perceived effectiveness of managerial resources and lending practices and policies 
the allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined with unallocated reserves  if any  to derive the required allowance for loan loss to be reflected on the consolidated statement of condition 
the loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period allowance for loan loss  net of the interim period net charge offs  from the current required allowance level 
this provision is then recorded in the income statement for that period 
members of senior management and the loan alco committee of the board of directors review the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss quarterly 
management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management capabilities of the company and has dedicated the resources necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations 
the allowance for loan loss increased to million at year end from million at the end of the million increase was primarily due to the million additional loans from the citizens branch acquisition as well as million of organic loan growth 
the allowance level was also impacted by the increased proportion of low risk consumer mortgage and home equity loans in the overall loan portfolio  as a result of both organic and acquired growth 
the ratio of the allowance for loan loss to total loans decreased three basis points to for year end as compared to for and for primarily due to stable underlying credit profile of our balanced portfolios 
management believes the year end allowance for loan losses to be adequate in light of the probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision of million in increased by million as a result of the growth in the loan portfolio and management s assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio  as discussed above 
the loan loss provision as a percentage of average loans was in as compared to in and in the loan loss provision was of net charge offs this year versus in and in  reflective of the current economic conditions 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated  as well as the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
this allocation is based on management s assessment  as of a given point in time  of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes when the risk factors of each component part change 
the allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts of the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category 
table allowance for loan losses by loan type loan loan loan loan loan s omitted except for ratios allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix consumer mortgage business lending consumer installment unallocated total as demonstrated in table above and discussed previously  business lending by its nature carries higher credit risk than consumer mortgage or consumer installment loans  and as a result a disproportionate amount of the allowance for loan losses is deemed necessary for this portfolio 
as in prior years  the unallocated allowance is maintained for inherent losses in the portfolio not reflected in the historical loss ratios  model imprecision  and for the acquired loan portfolios  including the branch banking centers acquired from citizens in and tlnb in 
the unallocated allowance decreased from million in to million in funding sources the company utilizes a variety of funding sources to support the earning asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives 
overall funding is comprised of three primary sources that possess a variety of maturity  stability  and price characteristics deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits public funds  and external borrowings 
the average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories are summarized below for the years indicated table average deposits average average average average average average s omitted  except rates balance rate paid balance rate paid balance rate paid noninterest checking deposits interest checking deposits regular savings deposits money market deposits time deposits total deposits as displayed in table above  total average deposits for equaled billion  up million or from the prior year 
excluding the average deposits acquired from the citizens branch and tlnb acquisitions  average deposits decreased million or 
consistent with the company s focus on expanding core account relationships and reducing higher cost time deposits  average core product relationships grew million or as compared to december  while time deposits were allowed to decline million or 
average deposits in were up million or from excluding the average deposits acquired from tlnb  onb and elmira  average deposits increased million or 
the company s funding composition continues to benefit from a high level of non public deposits  which reached an all time high in with an average balance of billion  an increase of million or over the comparable period 
the citizens branch and tlnb acquisitions accounted for million of additional non public deposits 
non public deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and provide a strong customer base for which a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products can be sold 
full year average deposits of local municipalities increased million or during  with the citizens branch and tlnb acquisitions accounting for million of the growth in municipal deposits and the remaining increase derived from organic deposit growth 
municipal deposit balances tend to be more volatile than non public deposits because they are heavily impacted by the seasonality of tax collection and fiscal spending patterns  as well as the longer term financial position of the government entities  which can change significantly from year to year 
the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits in excess of fdic coverage with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  as well as the competitive bidding nature of this product  management considers municipal time deposit funding to be similar to external borrowings and thus prices these products on a consistent basis 
the mix of average deposits in changed slightly in comparison to the weighting of non time interest checking  noninterest checking  savings and money market accounts increased from their levels  while  time deposits weighting decreased 
this change in deposit mix reflects the company s focus on expanding core account relationships and reducing higher cost time deposits 
the average balance for time deposit accounts decreased from of the total deposits in to of total deposits this year 
average core deposit balances increased from of the total deposits in to of total deposits this year 
this shift in mix  combined with lower average interest rates in all interest bearing deposit product categories caused the cost of interest bearing deposits to decline to in  as compared to in and in the remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of  or more outstanding as of december are as follows table time deposit  maturities s omitted less than three months three months to six months six months to one year over one year total external borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york and federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the repurchase market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
the company also had approximately million in fixed and floating rate subordinated debt outstanding at the end of that is held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts 
in the first quarter of  the company elected to redeem early million of variable rate trust preferred securities 
the company also elected to redeem early million of fixed rate trust preferred securities in january in december  the company completed a sale of million of trust preferred securities 
the securities mature on december  and carry an annual rate equal to the three month libor rate plus 
the company used the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes including the early call of the million of fixed rate trust preferred securities 
at the time of the offering  the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the variable rate trust preferred securities into a fixed rate obligation for a term of five years at a fixed rate of 
external borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for all of as compared to million or of total funding sources for the increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to the need to supplement the funding of strong organic loan growth and provide temporary financing for investment purchases made in advance of the significant amount of liquidity that was provided by the citizens branch acquisition  as well as the funding of acquisitions with cash over the past two years 
as shown in table on page  at year end  million or of external borrowings had remaining terms of one year or less  down from million or at december  and up considerably from the million or at the end of this change in external funding mix is primarily the result of a million short term leverage strategy entered into in the third quarter of funded with certain callable debt obligations classified as short term  reduced utilization of fed funds purchased and the early redemption of trust preferred obligations 
as displayed in table on page  the overall mix of funding has shifted in the percentage of funding derived from deposits decreased to in from in and in average fhlb borrowings increased during in order to supplement the funding of strong organic loan growth and provide temporary financing for investment purchases made in advance of the significant amount of liquidity that was provided by the citizens branch acquisition 
in addition  drastically lower short term external borrowing rates in the latter part of made this funding alternative more attractive in comparison to other sources such as time deposits  a very different environment than that experienced in and in  the company took advantage of improving spreads between short term convertible advances and certain short term investment opportunities 
this strategy not only produced positive net interest income  but it also served to demonstrate the company s ability to freely access liquidity sources despite tightened credit market conditions 
at december  external borrowings declined million from the end of the prior year  as a portion of the new liquidity from the branch acquisition was used to eliminate short term obligations 
the following table summarizes the outstanding balance of short term borrowings of the company as of december table short term borrowings s omitted  except rates federal funds purchased term borrowings at banks days or less over days commercial loans sold with recourse capital lease obligation subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts balance at end of period daily average during the year maximum month end balance weighted average rate during the year weighted average year end rate the following table shows the maturities of various contractual obligations as of december  table maturities of contractual obligations maturing maturing maturing after one after three within year but years but maturing one year within within after s omitted or less three years five years five years total federal home loan bank advances subordinated debt held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts commercial loans sold with recourse purchase obligations  primarily premises and equipment capital lease obligation operating leases total financial instruments with off balance sheet risk the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee 
these commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines 
standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party 
the credit risks associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit policies 
collateral may be obtained based on management s assessment of the customer s creditworthiness 
the fair value of these commitments is immaterial for disclosure in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the contract amount of these off balance sheet financial instruments as of december is as follows table off balance sheet financial instruments s omitted commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit total investments the objective of the company s investment portfolio is to hold low risk  high quality earning assets that provide favorable returns and provide another effective tool to actively manage its asset liability position in order to maximize future net interest income opportunities 
this must be accomplished within the following constraints a implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  b providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  c considering investment risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and d generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements 
as displayed in table below  the book value of the company s investment portfolio remained at billion at year end average investment balances including cash equivalents book value basis for decreased million or versus the prior year 
investment interest income in was million or lower than the prior year as a result of the lower average balances in the portfolio and a basis point decrease in the average investment yield from to primarily due to the reinvestment of cash flows of higher yielding securities into similar products at lower yields based on current market conditions 
during  the investment portfolio continued to decline due to the contractual runoff of securities 
cash flows from the maturing securities were used to pay down short term borrowings and the excess were invested in short term interest bearing cash equivalents  as the long term investments alternatives were not attractive in the then flat yield curve environment 
in the second half of  the company took advantage of certain investment opportunities to increase the portfolio through a short term leverage strategy 
this strategy produced positive net interest income and served to demonstrate the company s ability to freely access liquidity sources despite tightened credit market conditions 
as of december   the expected life to maturity of the portfolio was years versus years as of december  in cash flows from maturing investments were used to fund loan growth rather than be reinvested at unfavorable market rates in the first half of the year 
in the latter half of the year  the company took advantage of favorable market conditions to purchase investments in advance of the liquidity provided by the citizens branch acquisition in november the investment portfolio has limited credit risk due to the composition continuing to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos and municipal bonds 
the u 
s 
agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs and us agency cmos are all aaa rated highest possible rating 
the majority of the municipal bonds are aaa rated 
the portfolio does not include any private label mortgage backed securities mbss or private label collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
included in the available for sale portfolio are pooled trust preferred securities with a current par value of million and unrealized losses of million at december  the underlying collateral of these assets are principally trust preferred securities of smaller regional banks and insurance companies 
the company s securities are in the super senior  cash flow tranche of the pools 
all other tranches in these pools will incur losses before this tranche is impacted 
the market for these securities at december  is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active 
the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the fair value of these securities was based on a discounted cash flow model using market estimates of interest rates and volatility  as well as  observable quoted prices for similar assets in markets that have not been active 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported fair values 
the use of different assumptions  as well as  changes in market conditions  could result in materially different fair values 
the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities to recovery or maturity and does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  in determining if unrealized losses are other than temporary  management considers the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  any external credit ratings and the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
subsequent changes in market or credit conditions could change those evaluations 
ninety four percent of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale at year end versus at the end of the net pre tax market value gain over book value for the available for sale portfolio as of december  was million  up million from one year earlier 
this increase is indicative of the interest rate movements during the respective time periods and the changes in the size and composition of the portfolio

mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are listed based on the contractual maturity 
actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without penalties 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates  prices or credit risk 
credit risk associated with the company s loan portfolio has been previously discussed in the asset quality section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations starting on page although more than a third of the securities portfolio at year end was invested in municipal bonds  management believes that the tax risk of the company s municipal investments associated with potential future changes in statutory  judicial and regulatory actions is minimal 
the company also believes that it has an insignificant amount of credit risk in its investment portfolio because essentially all of the fixed income securities in the portfolio are aaa rated highest possible rating 
the company does not have any material foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure 
therefore  almost all the market risk in the investment portfolio is related to interest rates 
the ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity  in the short and long term time horizons is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by limits established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the policies to the asset liability committee alco  which meets each month 
the committee is made up of the company s senior management as well as regional and line of business managers who oversee specific earning asset classes and various funding sources 
asset liability management the primary objective of the company s asset liability management process is to maximize earnings and return on capital within acceptable levels of risk 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
the primary tools used by the company in managing interest rate risk are the income simulation model and economic value of equity modeling 
interest rate risk interest rate risk irr can result from the timing differences in the maturity repricing of an institution s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  and differences in the behavior of lending and funding rates  sometimes referred to as basis risk 
an example of basis risk would occur if floating rate assets and liabilities  with otherwise identical repricing characteristics  were based on market indexes that were imperfectly correlated 
given the potential types and differing related characteristics of irr  it is important that the company maintain an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify its primary sources of irr 
the company also recognizes that effective management of irr includes an understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the income statement 
accordingly  the company will manage its position so that it monitors its exposure to net interest income over both a one year planning horizon and a longer term strategic horizon 
it is the company s objective to manage its exposure to interest rate risk  bearing in mind that it will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may net interest margin be reduced 
income simulation income simulation is tested on a wide variety of balance sheet and treasury yield curve scenarios 
the simulation projects changes in net interest income caused by the effect of changes in interest rates 
the model requires management to make assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from management s outlook  as are the assumptions used for new loan yields and deposit rates 
loan prepayment speeds are based on a combination of current industry averages and internal historical prepayments 
balance sheet and yield curve assumptions are analyzed and reviewed by the alco committee regularly 
the following table reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity  using december  asset and liability levels as a starting point 
the prime rate and federal funds rate are assumed to move up basis points and down basis points over a month period while the treasury curve shifts to spreads over federal funds that are more consistent with historical norms 
deposit rates are assumed to move in a manner that reflects the historical relationship between deposit rate movement and changes in the federal funds rate  generally reflecting of the movement of the federal funds rate 
cash flows are based on contractual maturity  optionality and amortization schedules along with applicable prepayments derived from internal historical data and external sources 
net interest income sensitivity model calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income at december changes in interest rates basis points basis points normal yield curve n a basis points n a in the and models  the rising rate environment reflects an increase in net interest income nii from a flat rate environment while nii decreases if rates were to fall 
the change in nii in both environments is largely due to assets repricing faster than corresponding liabilities 
over a longer time period the growth in nii improves significantly in a rising rate environment as lower yielding assets mature and are replaced at higher rates 
for the model  the bank continues to show interest rate risk exposure to falling rates despite fed funds trading at a range of basis points 
in the basis point model normal yield curve  longer term rates are lowered to levels more consistent with historical norms 
in this model  net interest income declines during the first twelve months as cash flows from assets reprice to lower rates and corresponding liabilities are assumed to remain constant 
despite fed funds trading near  the company believes long term treasury rates could potentially fall further  and thus  the normal yield curve model tests the impact of this lower treasury rate scenario 
the analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and other factors 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above 
those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments 
such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric
