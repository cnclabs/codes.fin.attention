lydall does not undertake to update any forward looking statement made in this report or that may from time to time be made by or on behalf of the company 
overview and outlook lydall  inc has been incorporated in delaware since after originally being incorporated in connecticut in the company s principal executive offices are located in manchester  connecticut 
the company s subsidiaries design and manufacture specialty engineered filtration media  industrial thermal insulating solutions  automotive thermal and acoustical barriers  temperature control equipment  medical filtration media and devices and biopharmaceutical processing components for demanding thermal acoustical  filtration separation and biopharmaceutical applications 

table of contents business environment overview as many of lydall s operations conduct business on a worldwide basis  lydall s financial results were impacted by significant global  regional and industry economic downturns 
lydall has experienced continued pressure on revenues associated with the economic downturn  particularly in the automotive industry 
as automotive production and production capacity have been and continue to be reduced  lydall has seen a decline in demand for the company s automotive products 
disruptions in financial markets and recent restrictions on liquidity are adversely impacting the availability and cost of incremental credit  thereby adversely affecting the global economy and consumer spending patterns that impact the company s business 
lydall has been further impacted by foreign currency translation fluctuations 
lydall expects weaker demand with respect to the automotive industry as well as with other markets in which the company operates to persist in  affecting the company s revenues and profitability 
given the nature of the global economic downturn and its effects on the markets in which the company operates  lydall is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions 
while global economic conditions negatively impacted the company s financial results in  the company took many actions during the year  including the following initiating and subsequently accelerating the restructuring actions related to the consolidation of the north american automotive businesses  which is expected to save the company approximately million to million on an annualized basis  company wide discretionary cost and workforce reductions 
lydall s global workforce was reduced by approximately in  continuing to focus on executing growth strategies and investing in critical product offerings and technologies  including the commercialization of the membrane technology acquired in the dsm solutech bv acquisition and growing the company s vital fluids bioprocessing life science business  continuing to focus on lean six sigma and operational excellence initiatives in order to reduce costs and leverage synergies across the company  and exploring its core markets for suitable strategic acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances and licensing agreements to supplement growth  as well as divesting its transport business that was not consistent with the company s strategy 
the company currently receives approximately of its revenue from its foreign operations denominated in euros 
therefore  lydall s reported results of operations and financial condition are subject to changes in the exchange relationship between the us dollar and the euro 
the company s foreign and domestic operations limit foreign currency exchange transaction risk by completing transactions in functional currencies whenever practical or through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts when deemed appropriate 
if the company is not able to successfully hedge its currency exposure  changes in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar may materially impact the company s results of operations and cash flow 
during the majority of  the company was negatively impacted by increased raw material commodity pricing and energy costs 
specifically  costs of aluminum  used in most of the company s heat shield automotive products  and costs of various fibers  used in a number of the company s automotive and performance materials products  were volatile in the company continues to focus its efforts on mitigating the impact of higher raw material and energy costs to the extent possible through cost savings and operational efficiency gains  as well as passing commodity and energy cost increases to the company s customers 
further significant increases in raw material commodity and or energy prices could continue to negatively impact the company  to the extent the company is not able to mitigate the cost increases through operational efficiency gains or increased prices 
operational matters performance materials segment lydall s filtration and industrial thermal insulation businesses  included in the performance materials segment  are in markets that the company believes present growth opportunities for lydall 
the company expects the businesses to grow over the long term  primarily through the introduction of new products  expansion of share in existing markets and penetration of new markets 
the company continually explores its core markets for suitable strategic acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances and licensing agreements to supplement growth 
for example  the acquisition of dsm solutech bv in december allows the company to manufacture micro porous films trade names solupor and solufill using proprietary technology 
lydall solupor specialty 
table of contents microporous membranes are utilized in various markets and applications including batteries  fuel cells and supercapacitors  air and liquid filtration  and transdermal drug delivery 
the company continues to work with customers to deliver value added products for their specific needs to differentiate its products from competitors 
through the nine months ended september   net sales and operating income from the company s performance materials segment exceeded the comparable period of by approximately and  respectively  when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
during the fourth quarter of  the company s filtration and industrial thermal insulation businesses were impacted by global economic conditions 
specifically  many of the company s filtration media customers adjusted downward their production schedules and implemented or extended shut down periods 
this was done to reduce their current levels of inventory to better match their expected turnover rates in in addition  the company s industrial thermal insulation business continued to be negatively impacted by the slow down in the construction of new home and commercial buildings markets in the us that began in these events resulted in a significant decrease in net sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the fourth quarter of as a result  for the year ended december   net sales and operating income for the performance materials segment were million and million  respectively  or essentially flat with amounts when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
in  the company expects overall demand for its filtration and industrial thermal insulation products to be moderately impacted by the continued global economic recession 
thermal acoustical segment the company s thermal acoustical segment is comprised of lydall s global automotive parts business 
global automotive net sales represented approximately of the company s net sales 
throughout the first half of  the company s north american automotive business na auto was impacted by less demand for automobiles by consumers  which resulted in lower production of automobiles by automakers in the us subsequent to the second quarter of  production of automobiles in the north american automotive market decreased severely compared to typical periods 
according to csm worldwide  an automotive market forecasting service provided to suppliers  in the last half of production of cars and light trucks by north american oems was lower by approximately  or million vehicles  as compared to the comparable period of overall  in  production by north american oems was down by approximately  or million vehicles  as compared to a significant reduction in consumer demand for automobiles in europe began to impact the company s european automotive business euro auto in the fourth quarter of according to csm worldwide  in the fourth quarter of production of cars and light trucks by european oems was lower by approximately  or million vehicles  as compared to the comparable period of overall  in  production in europe was down by approximately as compared to for the year ended december   net sales for the thermal acoustical segment were million or approximately lower than results when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
the thermal acoustical segment reported an operating loss of million in  as compared to operating income of million in during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its required annual goodwill impairment testing and cash flow projections and market factors indicated that there was no remaining implied fair value attributable to the company s na auto goodwill 
accordingly  the company wrote off all of the million of na auto goodwill during the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  restructuring related charges  attributable to the consolidation of the na auto operations  were million in the fourth quarter of excluding these fourth quarter of charges of million  operating income for the thermal acoustical segment was million in looking forward into  current global economic conditions  including consumer credit restrictions  will continue to impact the consumers ability to purchase automobiles 
until such time as credit restrictions on consumer loans are eased and consumer spending in the automotive market increases  the company s automotive parts sales will be adversely impacted 
according to csm worldwide  production of automobiles in north america and europe are expected to be approximately lower than production and approximately lower than production levels 
as a result  the company expects lower net sales from the company s global automotive businesses in as compared to there are other risks associated with doing business in the north american automotive market 
a large amount of the company s north american automotive sales are to domestic automakers that are reporting financial losses  announcing near term liquidity concerns  facility closures and other restructuring actions 
the possibility of a bankruptcy filing among a large domestic automaker in has increased 
the company has significant accounts receivable from automakers at any point in time 
should an 
table of contents automaker not be able to pay the company the amounts owed as they become due  or at all  results of operations and cash flows of the company would be adversely affected 
also  certain domestic automakers have indicated that they may increase the number of parts that they source from lower cost countries in the future  which could negatively impact the company going forward 
the company s focus in will include the completion of its previously announced plan to close its st 
johnsbury  vermont facility and consolidate its north american automotive parts production into its hamptonville  north carolina operation 
this consolidation is expected to reduce operating costs  increase efficiency  and enhance the company s competitive position  while maintaining essentially the same level of manufacturing capacity 
the company commenced the transfer of equipment in the first quarter of and expects to substantially complete the consolidation by the end of the third quarter of the company incurred restructuring related charges of million in  and expects to incur approximately million in additional charges during beginning in the latter part of  the company expects to start to benefit from reduced costs 
on an annualized basis  the company expects to save approximately million to million in costs as a result of this consolidation 
the company will also continue its long term focus on establishing its position with asian automotive manufacturers in north america 
during  the company was qualified as a supplier to multiple asian manufacturers  quoted on automotive platforms  received orders and started to ship a nominal amount of orders 
other areas of focus for include the development of thermal acoustical products for non automotive applications

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and acquisition related intangibles 
the company had goodwill of million at december  and million at december  
table of contents sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather are subject to annual impairment tests or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units as defined in fas  including related goodwill 
the company s reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that operating segment or component 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other factors such as market capitalization 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge  which did occur during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company s na auto business  included in the thermal acoustical segment  was severely impacted by significant declines in sales of automobiles as a result of a global economic downturn and increased consumer credit restrictions 
the company s na auto customers are primarily domestic automakers who are reporting financial losses  closing facilities due to reduced manufacturing levels and capacity requirements and announcing other restructuring actions 
during the fourth quarter of  three of the largest north american automakers announced further expected reductions in automobile production in  as compared to typical annual production levels 
also  the company s affinity business  included in other products and services  continued to be impacted by lower net sales and operating losses due to a slow down in capital equipment spending in the semiconductor industry 
these factors  as well as greater risk in the automotive and semiconductor markets that the company serves  resulted in the fair value of the na auto and affinity reporting units to be lower than their book value 
the results of the company s goodwill impairment analysis indicated that there was no remaining implied fair value attributable to the company s na auto or affinity goodwill 
accordingly  the company wrote off all of the million of na auto goodwill and all of the million of affinity goodwill during the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment analysis of the remaining million of goodwill in the performance materials reporting unit and million of goodwill remaining in the vital fluids reporting unit  included in ops 
the company s goodwill impairment testing analysis analysis included projecting cash flows for the years and discounting those amounts based on appropriate market risks 
based on those projections and other assumption used in the analysis  the company concluded that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value of net assets 
as a result  there was no impairment of goodwill 
the calculation of future cash flows includes management estimates and assumptions that are based on the best available information as of the date of the assessment 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used in the analysis would not change the company s conclusion for the vital fluids and performance materials reporting units 
along with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate  the analysis indicated that a reduction in the projected operating income of the vital fluids and the performance materials reporting units over the next five years of approximately percent and percent  respectively  would require the company to perform an additional step as required by fas to measure the amount of an impairment loss  if any 
impairment of long lived assets as required by fas  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 

table of contents the carrying values of the assets determined to be impaired are reduced to their estimated fair values 
the fair values of the impaired assets are determined based on market conditions  including independent appraisals when appropriate  the income approach which utilizes cash flow projections  and other factors 
the company determined that long lived assets at the company s affinity business were impaired at december  this was based on reviewing estimated undiscounted cash flows and independent appraisals for its asset group  which indicated that the fair value was less than their carrying value 
the company considered its asset group to be certain assets and liabilities at affinity  primarily consisting of machinery and equipment  and buildings and improvements 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of  which represented the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset group compared to the carrying value of the asset group see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pensions pension costs and related obligations  as well as financial statement disclosures  related to its defined benefit pension plans are reported in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r fas 
pension cost and the related obligations recognized in the consolidated financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuary based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets of will be utilized for determining pension cost  while was used for determining  and pension cost 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of marketable debt and equity securities and economic and other indicators of future performance 
investment management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to balance market risk and to provide sufficient liquidity for near term payments of benefits accrued under the plan and to pay the expenses of administration 
the investment plan assets are stated at fair value  which is based on quoted market prices in an active market 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december  and december   the company based its discount rate assumption on a cash flow matching analysis  which matches the future cash outflows of the pension plans to a yield curve comprised of high quality fixed income investments 
benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve and a single discount rate specific to the plans is determined 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
fas requires that gains or losses as defined in fas be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in fas 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
since benefit accruals were frozen on certain domestic defined benefit plans on june   these plan participants are considered inactive participants 
therefore  the gain loss amortization for and beyond for these plans will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants 
as of december  and  the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently  pension cost for will include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pension income of million as a result of the expected return on assets exceeding the aggregate of i service cost from eligible employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement  
table of contents ii interest cost and iii amortization of actuarial loss and prior service cost 
as discussed above  the company s discount rate was at december  and was used for purposes of determining pension cost 
pension cost for is expected to be in the range of million to million  significantly higher than pension income of million in this increase in pension cost will be the result of i a lower assumed rate of return on assets in compared to in applied to a lower base of assets  ii a greater amount of the negative returns on the pension plans assets being amortized into pension expense in  and iii the lowering of the discount rate to in  as compared to used to determine expense 
the company contributed approximately million to its defined benefit pension plans during and expects to contribute approximately million in income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with fas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  related to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related net future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the projected operating results indicate that the ability to realize the future benefits is uncertain or not likely  a valuation allowance has been provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made

unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the united states taxes that may be payable on the distribution to the united states because it is not anticipated such earnings will be remitted to the united states
