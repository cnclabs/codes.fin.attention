the md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in item of this report 
historical results set forth in selected financial information  the consolidated financial statements and supplemental data included in item and item and this section should not be taken as indicative of the company s future operations 
overview the company s principal business activity is the ownership  management and development of income producing properties 
the company s long term objectives are to increase cash flow from operations and to maximize capital appreciation of its real estate investments 
the company s primary operating strategy is to focus on its community and neighborhood shopping center business and to operate its properties to achieve both cash flow growth and capital appreciation 
management believes there is potential for growth in cash flow as existing leases for space in the shopping centers expire and are renewed  or newly available or vacant space is leased 
the company intends to renegotiate leases where possible and seek new tenants for available space in order to maximize this potential for increased cash flow 
as leases expire  management expects to revise rental rates  lease terms and conditions  relocate existing tenants  reconfigure tenant spaces and introduce new tenants with the goal of increasing cash flow 
in those circumstances in which leases are not otherwise expiring  management selectively attempts to increase cash flow through a variety of means  or in connection with renovations or relocations  recapturing leases with below market rents and re leasing at market rates  as well as replacing financially troubled tenants 
when possible  management also will seek to include scheduled increases in base rent  as well as percentage rental provisions  in its leases 
the company s redevelopment and renovation objective is to selectively and opportunistically redevelop and renovate its properties  by replacing leases with below market rents with strong  traffic generating anchor stores such as supermarkets and drug stores  as well as other desirable local  regional and national tenants 
the company s strategy remains focused on continuing the operating performance and internal growth of its existing shopping centers  while enhancing this growth with selective retail redevelopments and renovations 
in light of the current capital constrained market  management believes acquisition and development opportunities for investment in existing and new shopping center and office properties are limited 
however  management believes that the company is positioned to take advantage of these opportunities when market conditions change because of its conservative capital structure 
it is management s view that several of the sub markets in which the company operates have very attractive supply demand characteristics 
the company will continue to evaluate acquisition  development and redevelopment as an integral part of its overall business plan 
although there has been a downturn in the national real estate market  to date  the effects on the office and retail markets in the metropolitan washington  dc area  where the majority of the company s properties are located  have been less severe 
however  continued deterioration in the local economies where the company s properties are located may lead to increased tenant bankruptcies  increased vacancies and decreased rental rates 

table of contents with a severe decline in overall consumer spending  retailers continue to struggle with declining sales and limited access to capital 
store closings are on the increase and retailers expanding their store count have disappeared 
vacancies have increased from a year ago 
our overall portfolio leasing percentage ended the year at  a decrease from at year end weakness was largely centered in small shop closures in both our loudoun county  virginia and florida shopping centers 
small in line restaurants were particularly hard hit  although consumer s spending at grocery stores increased by in at our grocery stores which reported sales 
in addition  because of the company s conservative capital structure  the company has not been significantly affected by the recent turmoil in the credit markets 
first  the company maintains a ratio of total debt to total assets of under  which allows the company to obtain additional secured borrowings if necessary 
second  as of december   fixed rate debt represented approximately of the company s notes payable  thus minimizing the effect of increased interest rates on the company s financial condition 
third  the company s earliest significant fixed rate debt maturity is not until finally  as of december   the company has loan availability of more than  on its  unsecured revolving line of credit 
although it is management s present intention to concentrate future acquisition and development activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers and office properties in the washington  dc baltimore metropolitan area and the southeastern region of the united states  the company may  in the future  also acquire other types of real estate in other areas of the country as opportunities present themselves 
while the company may diversify in terms of property locations  size and market  the company does not set any limit on the amount or percentage of company assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area 
in addition to investing in properties in the washington  dc baltimore metropolitan area  from through  the company also acquired a grocery anchored neighborhood shopping center in florida  totaling  square feet and a grocery anchored neighborhood shopping center in georgia totaling  square feet 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the company s financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies which the company considers critical in that they may require judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
additional discussion of accounting policies which the company considers significant  including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below  can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
real estate investments real estate investment properties are stated at historic cost basis less depreciation 
the company intends to own its real estate investment properties over a long term 
no real estate investment properties have been sold since the company s formation in management believes that these assets have generally appreciated in value since their acquisition and  accordingly  the aggregate current value exceeds their aggregate net book value and also exceeds the value of the company s liabilities as reported in these financial statements 
because these financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap  they do not report the current value of the company s real estate investment properties 
the company purchases real estate investment properties from time to time and allocates the purchase price to various components  such as land  buildings  and intangibles related to in place leases 
table of contents and customer relationships in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations 
the purchase price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component 
the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates 
as such  the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease up period 
the company determines the fair value of above and below market intangibles associated with in place leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition 
in the case of above and below market leases  the company considers the remaining contractual lease period and renewal periods  taking into consideration the likelihood of the tenant exercising its renewal options 
the fair value of a below market lease component is recorded as deferred income and amortized as additional lease revenue over the remaining contractual lease period and any renewal option periods included in the valuation analysis 
the fair value of above market lease intangibles is recorded as a deferred asset and is amortized as a reduction of lease revenue over the remaining contractual lease term 
the company determines the fair value of at market in place leases considering the cost of acquiring similar leases  the foregone rents associated with the lease up period and carrying costs associated with the lease up period 
intangible assets associated with at market in place leases are amortized as additional expense over the remaining contractual lease term 
to the extent customer relationship intangibles are present in an acquisition  the fair value of the intangibles are amortized over the life of the customer relationship 
if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a real estate investment property  the company prepares an impairment analysis to assess that the carrying value of the real estate investment property does not exceed its estimated fair value 
the company considers both quantitative and qualitative factors including recurring operating losses  significant decreases in occupancy  and significant adverse changes in legal factors and business climate 
if impairment indicators are present the company performs a comparison of the projected cash flows of the property over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying value of that property 
the company assesses its undiscounted projected cash flows based upon estimated capitalization rates  historic operating results and market conditions that may affect the property 
if such carrying value is greater than the undiscounted projected cash flows  the company would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its then estimated fair market value 
the value of any property is sensitive to the actual results of any of the aforementioned estimated factors  either individually or taken as a whole 
should the actual results differ from management s projections  the valuation could be negatively or positively affected 
when incurred  the company capitalizes the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment 
all repair and maintenance expenditures are expensed when incurred 
in addition  we capitalize leasehold improvements when certain criteria are met  including when we supervise construction and will own the improvement 
tenant improvements we own are depreciated over the life of the respective lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
interest  real estate taxes  development related salary costs and other carrying costs are capitalized on projects under construction 
once construction is substantially complete and the assets are placed in service  rental income  direct operating expenses  and depreciation associated with such properties are included in current operations 
in the initial rental operations of development projects  a project is considered substantially complete and available for occupancy upon completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activity 
substantially completed portions of a project are accounted for as separate projects 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method and estimated useful lives of to years for base buildings and up to years for certain other improvements 

table of contents deferred leasing costs certain initial direct costs incurred by the company in negotiating and consummating successful leases are capitalized and amortized over the initial base term of the leases 
deferred leasing costs consist of commissions paid to third party leasing agents as well as internal direct costs such as employee compensation and payroll related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing successful leasing related activities 
such activities include evaluating prospective tenants financial condition  evaluating and recording guarantees  collateral and other security arrangements  negotiating lease terms  preparing lease documents and closing transactions 
in addition  deferred leasing costs include amounts attributed to in place leases associated with acquisition properties as determined pursuant to the application of sfas no 
revenue recognition rental and interest income is accrued as earned except when doubt exists as to collectibility  in which case the accrual is discontinued 
recognition of rental income commences when control of the space has been given to the tenant 
when rental payments due under leases vary from a straight line basis because of free rent periods or scheduled rent increases  income is recognized on a straight line basis throughout the initial term of the lease 
expense recoveries represent a portion of property operating expenses billed to tenants  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs 
expense recoveries are recognized in the period when the expenses are incurred 
rental income based on a tenant s revenue  known as percentage rent  is accrued when a tenant reports sales that exceed a specified breakpoint specified in the lease agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts current and deferred receivables accounts receivable primarily represent amounts accrued and unpaid from tenants in accordance with the terms of the respective leases  subject to the company s revenue recognition policy 
receivables are reviewed monthly and reserves are established with a charge to current period operations when  in the opinion of management  collection of the receivable is doubtful 
in addition to rents due currently  accounts receivable include amounts representing minimum rental income accrued on a straight line basis to be paid by tenants over the remaining term of their respective leases 
reserves are established with a charge to income for tenants whose rent payment history or financial condition casts doubt upon the tenant s ability to perform under its lease obligations 
legal contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are generally covered by insurance 
while the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  the company believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or the results of operations 
once it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements 
both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered probable can be difficult to determine

table of contents capital strategy and financing activity as a general policy  the company intends to maintain a ratio of its total debt to total asset value of or less and to actively manage the company s leverage and debt expense on an ongoing basis in order to maintain prudent coverage of fixed charges 
asset value is the aggregate fair market value of the current portfolio properties and any subsequently acquired properties as reasonably determined by management by reference to the properties aggregate cash flow 
given the company s current debt level  it is management s belief that the ratio of the company s debt to total asset value was below as of december  the organizational documents of the company do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of indebtedness that it may incur 
the board of directors may  from time to time  reevaluate the company s debt capitalization policy in light of current economic conditions  relative costs of capital  market values of the company property portfolio  opportunities for acquisition  development or expansion  and such other factors as the board of directors then deems relevant

ffo is defined by nareit as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  plus minority interests  extraordinary items and real estate depreciation and amortization  excluding gains or losses from property sales 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs  which is disclosed in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows for the applicable periods 
there are no material legal or functional restrictions on the use of ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income  its most directly comparable gaap measure  as a indicator of the company s operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
management considers ffo a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time ie depreciation  which is contrary to what we believe occurs with our assets  and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other reits
