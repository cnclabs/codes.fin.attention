item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations of alliance bankshares corporation bankshares  alliance bank corporation bank  alliance bank mortgage division abmd alliance home funding ahf  and alliance insurance agency aia  on a consolidated basis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with bankshares consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report on form k 
all share amounts and dollar amounts per share in the following discussion have been adjusted to reflect the three for twenty stock split in the form of a stock dividend distributed on june  forward looking statements some of the matters discussed below and elsewhere in this report include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include statements regarding profitability  liquidity  adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  interest rate sensitivity  market risk and financial and other goals 
forward looking statements often use words such as believe  expect  plan  may  will  should  project  contemplate  anticipate  forecast  intend or other words of similar meaning 
you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
the forward looking statements we use in this report are subject to significant risks  assumptions and uncertainties  including among other things  the following important factors that could affect the actual outcome of future events adverse changes in the overall national economy as well as adverse economic conditions in our specific market areas within northern virginia and the greater washington  dc metropolitan area  risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values  sustained weakness in the local housing market  additional negative changes in the national and local home mortgage market  the timing and value realized upon the sale of other real estate owned oreo property  changes in regulatory requirements and or restrictive banking legislation  including the impact of any policies or programs including the recently implemented and revised eesa  changes in federal deposit insurance corporation fdic deposit insurance programs including the tlgp program  loss of key production personnel  fluctuations in market rates of interest and loan and deposit pricing  which could negatively affect our net interest margin  asset valuation and income and expense projections  effects of implementation of certain balance sheet strategies  timing of expected implementation of certain balance sheet strategies  impacts of fair value accounting  including income statement volatility  anticipated growth of our insurance company  assumptions used within our asset liability management alm process and net interest income nii and economic value of equity eve models  maintaining and developing well established and valuable client relationships and referral source relationships  our use of technology or the use of technology by key competitors  changing trends in customer profiles and behavior  competitive factors within the financial services industry  impacts of implementing various accounting standards  and other factors described from time to time in our sec filings 
in addition  a continuation of the recent turbulence in significant portions of the global financial markets  particularly if it worsens  could impact our performance  both directly by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities  and indirectly by affecting our counterparties and the economy generally 
dramatic declines in the housing market in the past year have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions in the united states 
concerns about the stability of the us financial markets generally have reduced the availability of funding to certain financial institutions  leading to a tightening of credit  reduction of business activity  and increased market volatility 
there can be no assurance that the eesa  the arra or the actions taken by the treasury thereunder will stabilize the us financial system or alleviate the industry or economic factors that may adversely affect our business 
in addition  our business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures in the current environment  both by changes in the creditworthiness and performance of our counterparties and by changes in the competitive landscape 
because of these and other uncertainties  our actual results and performance may be materially different from results indicated by these forward looking statements 
in addition  our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
we caution you that the above list of important factors is not exclusive 
these forward looking statements are made as of the date of this report  and we may not undertake steps to update these forward looking statements to reflect the impact of any circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward looking statements are made

the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in estimating risk 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our financial statements could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has two basic components the specific allowance for impaired credits and the general allowance based on relevant risk factors 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for loans identified for impairment testing 
impairment testing includes consideration of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  support available from financial guarantors and the fair market value of collateral 
these factors are combined to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
when impairment is identified  a specific reserve is established based on bankshares calculation of the loss embedded in the individual loan 
the minimum impairment reserve is the amount which would be included in the allowance if the loan were included in the unimpaired category 
bankshares does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment testing unless loans become days or more past due 
the general allowance is determined by aggregating un criticized loans and non classified loans by loan type based on common purpose  collateral  repayment source or other credit characteristics 
we then apply allowance factors which in the judgment of management represent the expected losses over the life of the loans 
in determining those factors  we consider the following delinquencies and overall risk ratings  loss history  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  the experience and depth of the borrowers management  national and local economic trends  concentrations of credit by individual credit size and by class of loans  quality of loan review system and the effect of external factors eg  competition and regulatory requirements 
this is the largest component of the overall allowance 
goodwill bankshares adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
based on the results of these tests  bankshares concluded that there was impairment during  and write downs of thousand were recorded 
additionally  under sfas no 
 acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over its useful life 
the costs of other intangible assets  based on independent valuation and or internal valuations  are being amortized over their estimated lives not to exceed fifteen years 
share based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  such as stock options and nonvested shares  based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant 
bankshares adopted sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective method and as such  results for prior periods have not been restated 
compensation cost has been measured using the fair value of an award on the grant date and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period

this decrease is primarily attributable to the substantial increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the following table illustrates average balances of total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated  showing the average distribution of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and related income  expense and corresponding weighted average yields and rates 
the average balances used in these tables and other statistical data were calculated using daily average balances

products such as money market and savings accounts have rates that are set by management  compared to time deposit rates  which are driven by the competitive market which typically causes the lagging effect of the time deposit rates 
non interest bearing demand deposit balances averaged million as of the year ended december   or million less than the year ended december  the local real estate economy remains soft and  as a result  title company and real estate closing company balances remained below the traditional levels experienced in the past 
in addition  these balances are subject to seasonal changes 
during the final quarter of the year  balances generally run lower 
the following table describes the impact on our interest income and expense resulting from changes in average balances and average rates for the periods indicated

nonaccrual loans 
a loan may be placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent days or more 
on december   alliance bank had million in loans that were on nonaccrual status compared to loans that were on nonaccrual status totaling million at december  the majority of the million relates to two loans  one for thousand which relates to a first trust on two adjacent office condominiums in northern virginia  and one for thousands which is a commercial construction loan on a residential condominium project in virginia beach 
the remainder of the balance is million to eight different borrowers secured by first or second trusts on properties in the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
we have allocated thousand of the allowance for loan losses towards these nonaccrual loans 
the majority of the december  nonaccrual loan balance of million was foreclosed and became oreo in the first quarter of other real estate owned oreo 
as of december   we had million classified as oreo on the balance sheet  compared to million as of december  this balance reflects the shift from nonaccrual loans to oreo 
as of december   the oreo balance consists of million which relates to three land loans to one former borrower in northern virginia  million which is a single family residence under construction in northern virginia  million which relates to farmland development acreage in the winchester  virginia area  million which is secured by residential building lots in northern virginia  million which relates to building lots in northern virginia  thousand which relates to a two unit office condominium in richmond  virginia  thousand  which is secured by a commercial building and assets of a retail hardware and lumber company  thousand which relates to a single family residence for sale in northern virginia  thousand which relates to a residential building lot in northern virginia  thousand which relates to a single family residence in central virginia  and thousand which relates to a residential building lot in a recreational development in central virginia

as of december  we had million set aside for specific reserves 
allowance for loan losses and asset quality we closely monitor individual loans  and relationship officers are charged with working with customers to resolve potential credit issues in a timely manner with minimum exposure to us 
we maintain a policy of adding an appropriate amount to the allowance for loan losses to ensure an adequate reserve based on the portfolio composition  specific credit extended by alliance bank and general economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   or of loans outstanding  compared to million or of loans outstanding  at december  these ratios exclude loans held for sale 
we have allocated million and million  respectively  of our allowance for loan losses at december  and december  for specific non performing loans 
in  we had net charge offs of million compared to million in and thousand in as of december   there was one loan past due days and still accruing interest  the principal balance of which was thousand 
as part of our routine credit administration process  we engage an outside consulting firm to review our loan portfolio periodically 
the information from these reviews is used to monitor individual loans as well as to evaluate the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at each period  management takes into consideration the historical loan losses experienced by the organization  current economic conditions affecting the borrowers ability to repay  the volume of loans  trends in delinquent  nonaccruing  and potential problem loans  and the quality of collateral securing loans 
after charging off all known losses which have been incurred in the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover its estimate of probable losses

however  management does not believe that the allowance for loan losses can be fragmented by category with any precision that would be useful to investors 
as such  the entire allowance is available for losses in any particular category  not withstanding this allocation 
the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses is based primarily upon those factors discussed above in computing the allowance for loan losses as a whole 
because all of these factors are subject to change  the allocation and actual results are not necessarily indicative of the exact category of potential loan losses

in  we established our mortgage banking division  abmd 
as part of our business strategy to offer complementary services to clients while minimizing risk  generally loans originated by abmd are presold to correspondent lenders 
as of december   thousand of loans held for sale were part of our asset base 
our business objective includes having the loans sold  shipped and funded within a day period 
prior to the creation of abmd  ahf performed these functions 
loans held for sale were million at december  in  abmd originated million of residential mortgages compared to million in the large decline in originations between and is related to the heavier staffing level of mortgage production officers in and the significant deterioration of the housing market in trading assets effective january   bankshares adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements and sfas no 
 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
at adoption  we felt that the provisions of these accounting standards provide a more realistic long term view of our balance sheet

the december  effective portfolio yield was 
all of the private label collateralized mortgage obligations pcmos are rated aaa or aaa by moody s  s p or fitch 
the portfolio yield dropped on a year over year basis by basis points 
the two key drivers of the decline are sba repricing and agency mix changes 
all of the sba securities are earning interest on a variable rate basis with coupon rate based on the prime rate 
the prime rate declined from at december  to at december  as part of our trading asset strategy we increased our position in agency securities 
the expanded agency securities portfolio was impacted by the declining interest rate environment experienced in trading securities classified as level during the third quarter of  and throughout the fourth quarter of  the markets were acting in a very distressed and dysfunctional manner 
in evaluating the fair value of instruments held in our portfolios  we determined that the securities that contained a libor basis were valued in a distressed manner 
as such  we considered other factors such as typical spreads for the instruments and requested supplemental dealer pricing to determine fair value 
we believe this approach more accurately reflects the fair value of the instruments

non interest income the following table highlights the major components of non interest income for the periods referenced year ended december  dollars in thousands insurance commissions deposit account service charges gain on loan sales net gain loss on sale of securities trading activity and fair value adjustments other total our primary source of non interest income is insurance commissions

commission revenues added million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the year ended december  the significant change between and insurance commissions is directly related to the timing of battlefield and fig acquisitions 
another source of non interest income is gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans 
for december  gains from sales of mortgage loans through our mortgage division  abmd  were thousand compared to million for the year ended december  in  abmd has become a more customer service oriented business with two staff people as compared to  when we had a larger staff and production office 
in gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans were million and were earned through ahf 
in december  bankshares determined to restructure and eliminate the mortgage banking operations conducted by ahf 
in the year ended december   we had a net loss of thousand on the sale of investment securities 
this represents a decrease of thousand from the level net gain of thousand 
the net loss on the sale of investment securities for was thousand 
in connection with our repositioning of our balance sheet in  the items accounted for under sfas no 
have generated a net loss for bankshares 
the bulk of the loss is the mark to market adjustments on liabilities 
as bankshares has downsized the total balance sheet  there has been a mismatch between assets and liabilities  which caused more volatility in the financial results than expected 
to correct this imbalance  we prepaid million in fhlb advances in the first quarter of in addition  we had maturities of fair value liabilities of million in for the year ended  the net loss on trading activity and fair value adjustments was million  compared to million for the year ended we continue to rebalance our fair value assets and liabilities in an attempt to provide a better correlation to the fair value movements

the largest component of non interest expense is salary and benefits expense 
the expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to the december  level of million 
a key component of total salary and benefits expense was the personnel expenses for aia which were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  occupancy and furniture and equipment costs were million in compared to the level of million 
these increases are attributable to the opening of the annandale branch in and costs associated with management s decision not to pursue our proposed banking presence in the fredericksburg market

several years ago  the board and management made a strategic decision to pursue the fredericksburg market 
our initial entry into the market was through the establishment of a loan production office lpo and an acquisition of a local insurance agency 
we had also secured leases on two prospective bank branch locations 
due to the economic environment  we have made a business decision to re tool the fredericksburg initiative 
we are seeking to sublease the lpo and the two banking locations 
the bank is obligated for lease payments for three leases until a sublease is entered into by the bank and another party 
we plan to maintain the fig insurance operation in its present form at this time 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in our effective tax rates were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  deposits we seek deposits within our market area by paying competitive interest rates  offering high quality customer service and using technology to deliver deposit services effectively 
at december   the deposit portfolio was million  an increase of million compared to the december  level of million 
we have made a special effort to obtain deposits from title and mortgage loan closing companies  which generally provide a good source of non interest bearing deposits 
we have developed products and services using available technology that meet the needs of these customers 
the balances on deposit with us tend to fluctuate greatly during any given month  depending on transaction scheduling and overall market conditions 
these balances represent a substantial portion of our non interest bearing deposits or a key portion our basic funding for the organization 
these deposits are subject to significant reduction during slower real estate markets  as evidenced in and in late  we experienced a modest increase in our deposits in the title and mortgage loan closing market niche as minor improvements in the housing market occurred both refinancings and purchases 
as the business activity changes  and particularly if average title and mortgage loan closing deposits continue to decline  we will use wholesale or brokered deposits 
we use these funding tools to offset funding gaps as necessary 
in addition  to meet the withdrawal needs of these customers  we monitor our liquidity  investment securities and lines of credit on a constant basis 
we have sold and will in the future sell trading and investment securities as a source of liquidity 
some of our wholesale brokered deposits are accounted for on a cost basis  others are accounted for on a fair value basis 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of wholesale brokered deposits accounted for on a cost basis 
this type of funding is a tool to support the growth of the bank and liquidity needs 
as market conditions warrant and balance sheet needs dictate  we may continue to participate in the wholesale brokered certificate of deposit market 
as with any deposit product  we have potential risk for non renewal by the customer and or broker 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of wholesale brokered deposits accounted for on a fair value basis 
as of december   we had a reduction of million in the amount of fair value basis wholesale brokered deposits compared to december  as fair value deposits matured  management made a decision on future transactions to weight more of the brokered deposits towards a cost basis of accounting to achieve a better balance between fair value liabilities and fair value assets 
at december   deposits were million  a decrease of million from the december  level of million 
as of december   we had million of wholesale brokered deposits  million of which were accounted for at fair value 
as of december   we had million of brokered deposits  all of which were accounted for at cost 
the brokered deposit market has proven to be a reliable source of funding but as with any deposit product  we have potential risk for non renewal by the customer and or broker 
in and  we obtained brokered deposits under a state government program for community banks 
in the past  we have had million of brokered deposits under this program 
as of december   we did not have brokered deposits under this program

the subordinated debentures are an unsecured obligation of bankshares and are junior in right of payment to all present and future senior indebtedness of bankshares 
the trust preferred securities are guaranteed by bankshares on a subordinated basis 
the trust preferred securities are presented in the consolidated balance sheets of bankshares under the caption trust preferred capital securities of subsidiary trust 
bankshares records distributions payable on the trust preferred securities as an interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of issuance of the trust preferred securities was approximately thousand

the bulk of purchased funds are made up from the following two categories customer repos and outstanding federal funds sold 
customer repos amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  outstanding federal funds purchased were million  million and million at december   december   and december   respectively 
customer repos are standard repurchase agreement transactions that involve a bank customer instead of wholesale banks and brokers 
we offer this product as an accommodation to larger retail and commercial customers that request safety for their funds beyond the fdic deposit insurance limits or as part of a series of cash management products 
we believe this product offers us a stable source of financing at a reasonable market rate of interest 
we do not have any open repos with broker dealers 
the fhlb is a key source of funding for the organization 
during the periods presented we have used overnight advances daily rate credit to support our short term liquidity needs 
on a longer term basis  we use fhlb advances to augment our funding portfolio  some of which are accounted for on a fair value basis  and some of which are accounted for on a cost basis 
as of december  and december   we had fhlb long term advances accounted for on a fair value basis of million and million  respectively 
these advances mature at varying dates through early during the first quarter of  we prepaid two of our fair value long term advances  totaling million with an effective interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rates on long term fhlb advances accounted for on a fair value basis was and as of december  and december   respectively

there were no fhlb long term advances accounted for on a cost basis as of december   compared to three long term advances totaling million as of december   with interest rates ranging from to and maturities ranging from to trading liabilities classified as level during the third quarter of and throughout the fourth quarter of  the investment and debt markets were acting in a very distressed and dysfunctional manner 
in evaluating the fair value of funding instruments  we determined that the typical valuation techniques did not take into account the distressed and dysfunctional markets 
as such  we considered other factors such as typical spreads for the instruments  option adjusted spreads  swap curves  discounted cashflow models  previously observable non distressed valuations and bond issuance rates and spreads for investment and non investment grade instruments 
as of december   we concluded that the fair value of the long term fhlb advance was million or a liability of million greater than the par value of the instrument or million 
liquidity our overall asset liability strategy takes into account the need to maintain adequate liquidity to fund asset growth and deposit runoff 
our liquidity is impacted by the general growth of the bank  the growth of aia  title company balances  the national and local mortgage refinance market  and the trading and investment portfolios 
we use a variety of tools to manage our liquidity 
these include pricing on loans and deposits  purchase or sale of investments  brokered deposits  the sale or participation of loans  and rates and fees on home mortgages 
in addition  we have a variety of credit facilities at our disposal 
our funding department monitors our overall position daily 
we can and will draw upon federal funds lines with correspondent banks  draw upon reverse repurchase agreement lines with correspondent banks and use fhlb advances 
our deposit customers frequently have lower deposit balances in the middle of the month 
the deposit balances generally rise toward the end of each month 
as such  we use wholesale funding techniques to support our overall balance sheet growth 
we provide temporary funding on presold loans originated by abmd 
the liquidity requirements vary based upon market and economic conditions 
the funds advanced on this line allow us to originate and hold mortgages until they are sold to third party investors

these off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees which would impact the overall liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept and or use these commitments 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the nature  business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off balance sheet arrangements 
with the exception of these off balance sheet arrangements  and bankshares obligations in connection with its trust preferred securities  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk alm risk management 
we engage a consulting firm to model our short term and long term interest rate risk profile 
the model includes basic business assumptions  interest rates  repricing information and other relevant market data to necessary to project our interest rate risk 
the board of directors has established interest rate risk limits for both short term and long term interest rate exposure 
on a periodic basis  management reports to the board of directors on our base interest rate risk profile and expectations of changes in the profiles based on certain interest rate shocks 
net interest income sensitivity short term interest rate risk 
bankshares alm process evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
this analysis involves shocking the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of bankshares shorter term interest rate risk 
this analysis is accomplished by assuming a static balance sheet over a period of time with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under various rate scenarios 
these assumptions include prepayments  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant by bankshares 
the alm model results for december  are shown in the table below 
assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points  the results indicate bankshares would expect net interest income to decrease over the next twelve months by 
assuming a shift downward of basis points  bankshares would expect net interest income to decrease over the next twelve months by 
economic value of equity long term interest rate risk 
the economic value of equity process models the cashflows of financial instruments to maturity 
the model incorporates growth and pricing assumptions to develop a baseline eve 
the interest rates used in the model are then shocked for an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the results of the shocked model are compared to the baseline results to determine the percentage change in eve under the various scenarios 
the resulting percentage change in eve is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the table below shows as of december  and alm model results under various interest rate shocks december  december  interest rate shocks nii eve nii eve bp bp bp bp all results above are within bankshares current interest rate risk policy guidelines 
interest rate gap 
in addition to the nii and eve models  management reviews our static gap position 
the cumulative negative gap position within one year was million  or of total assets  at december  while this measurement technique is common in the financial services industry  it has limitations and is not our sole tool for measuring interest rate sensitivity 
we do not believe this model accurately reflects bankshares true short term and long term interest rate exposure 
as an example  million of the investment and trading securities at december  are classified as greater than five years due to the contractual maturity of the instruments 
investment and trading securities are easily marketed and can be liquidated in a short period of time 
as a result  it is reasonable to consider a portion of  or perhaps all of  the million of investment and trading securities as the within three month category  which further suggests a more balanced short term interest rate position for bankshares 
the following table reflects our december  static interest rate gap position december  maturing or repricing within over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities trading securities loans held for sale loans interest bearing deposits federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits money market deposit accounts savings accounts iras time deposits  at fair value time deposits total interest bearing deposits fhlb long term advances  at fair value fhlb long term advances customer repurchase agreements other borrowings trust preferred capital notes total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap cumulative gap total assets interest rate risk management summary 
as part of our interest rate risk management  we typically use the trading  investment portfolios and our wholesale funding instruments to balance our interest rate exposure 
there is no guarantee that the risk management techniques and balance sheet management strategies we employ will be effective in periods of rapid rate movements or extremely volatile periods 
we believe our strategies are prudent and within our policy guidelines in the base case of our modeling efforts as of december
