item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section provides an analysis of the stewardship financial corporation s the corporation consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december  and the analysis should be read in conjunction with the related audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein 
cautionary note regarding foward looking statements this annual report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  and may be identified by the use of such words as believe  expect  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential 
examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  estimates with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of the corporation that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates 
these factors include changes in general  economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory conditions  or the development of an interest rate environment that adversely affects the corporation s interest rate spread or other income anticipated from operations and investments 
as used in this annual report  we and us and our refer to stewardship financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiary  atlantic stewardship bank  depending on the context 
introduction the corporation s primary business is the ownership and supervision of the bank and  through the bank  the corporation has been  and intends to continue to be  a community oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
the corporation currently has full service branches offices located in bergen  passaic and morris counties in new jersey 
the corporation conducts a general commercial and retail banking business encompassing a wide range of traditional deposit and lending functions along with the other customary banking services 
the corporation earns income and generates cash primarily through the deposit gathering activities of the branch network 
these deposits gathered from the general public are then utilized to fund the corporation s lending and investing activities 
the corporation has developed a strong deposit base with good franchise value 
a mix of a variety of different deposit products  along with a strong focus on customer service  is used to attract customers and build depositor relationships 
challenges facing the organization are to continue to grow the existing branch deposit levels  provide adequate technology enhancements to achieve efficiencies and expand services  offer a competitive product line  and provide the highest level of customer service 
the corporation is affected by the overall economic conditions in northern new jersey  the interest rate and yield curve environment  and the overall national economy 
these factors are relevant because they will affect our ability to attract specific deposit products  our ability to invest in loan and investment products  and our ability to earn acceptable profits without incurring increased risks 
there continues to be strong competition to attract deposit balances  with customers opting out of low or no interest bearing core deposits into higher yielding certificates of deposits 
during  competing financial institutions looking to grow their balance sheets and fund loan activity continued to be aggressive in offering above market rates to attract new money to their organizations 
this has put tremendous pressure on the net interest margins at community banks and has negatively impacted banks abilities to grow core deposits and earnings 
when evaluating the financial condition and operating performance of the corporation  management reviews historical trends  peer comparisons  asset and deposit concentrations  interest margin analysis  adequacy of loan loss reserve and loan quality performance  adequacy of capital under current positions as well as to support future expansion  adequacy of liquidity  and overall quality of earnings performance 
in march the corporation moved its stock from trading on the bulletin board of nasdaq to the nasdaq capital market  providing improved visibility to the stock  better pricing to market and overall liquidity in the stock trading 
during  the corporation began to further develop the infrastructure needed to allow the entity to continue to build franchise value  expand its customer base  and offer appropriate products and services to its existing and future customer base 
in march the corporation opened its eleventh branch location at franklin avenue  wyckoff  bergen county  new jersey 
this branch is a convenient location to service existing as well as new customers 
it operates as a full service facility offering safe deposit boxes  a two lane drive up and an atm drive up facility 
in september the corporation successfully opened its twelfth branch in westwood  bergen county  new jersey 
this represented a new market for the corporation  located in the eastern part of bergen county 
westwood is a strong local community with a diversified mix of small business and retail markets 
finally  the corporation successfully negotiated a lease in the town of north haledon  passaic county and opened its thirteenth branch in december this branch is located between the midland park and wayne area branches and services existing customers as well as attracts a new customer base 

table of contents management is encouraged by the positive reception received in these communities and believes that each of these branches contribute to a strong branch network 
the branch network provides for solid coverage in both existing and new markets in strong towns in the three counties in which we operate 
as the branches mature  they will provide a strong diverse customer base to provide for both consumer and business customers 
this investment in these areas should provide benefits in the future in providing for new deposit and lending relationships 
our initiatives for primarily focused on efficiencies 
in early we completed our conversion to a new core processing system 
the new system provides the branches and the back office with significant enhancements and efficiencies over the prior system 
improvements and upgrades of our online banking continue to be a priority 
for example  the introduction of e statements provides for an efficient  cost effective distribution channel 
additional development of our online banking features continues  with a significant amount of testing performed in leading to a rollout 
in late  the bank consummated the sale of our existing merchant services portfolio to elavon  inc elavon  a leading merchant processor 
under the agreement  elavon services the merchants previously serviced by the bank 
prior to the transaction  the bank provided servicing for approximately merchants 
a gain of  was recorded on the transaction 
the bank will continue to earn certain fees from ongoing portfolio and marketing activity 
in  the corporation  like all financial institutions  experienced a difficult and complicated economic and operating environment 
the corporation s results have been affected by the economic downturn through higher loan loss provisions 
in addition  competition in the northern new jersey market continues to be intense and the challenges of operating most of the year in a flat interest rate market made it very difficult to attract deposits at appropriate interest rate levels 
although the area in which the bank operates has been somewhat shielded from the national economic downturn  management continues to find it challenging to attract low cost core deposits and remains cautiously optimistic regarding the lending opportunities 
the corporation has not been involved in the subprime lending area 
considering these factors  the corporation continued to perform well when compared with peer group performance 
the corporation will continue to concentrate its efforts on growing and maturing its existing branch network  developing new products and services  capitalizing on technology and focusing on improved efficiencies during recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent pronouncements and their effect on the corporation s financial statements can be found in note of the financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  is based upon the corporation s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the corporation to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the corporation s significant accounting policies 
management believes the corporation s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate  which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the corporation s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the corporation s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the northern new jersey area experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the corporation s control 

table of contents earnings summary the corporation reported net income of million  or basic earnings per share  for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the million recorded for the decrease in earnings was primarily the result of increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses  and a decrease in noninterest income  partially offset by an increase in net interest income 
the return on average assets decreased in to from in the return on average equity decreased to for from in results of operations net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is the net interest income derived from the bank  which represents the difference between the interest earned on assets and interest paid on funds acquired to support those assets 
net interest income is affected by the balances and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in their corresponding yields and costs  and by the volume of interest earning assets funded by noninterest bearing deposits 
the corporation s principal interest earning assets are loans made to businesses and individuals and investment securities 
for the year ended december   net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased to million from million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of million  or 
the increase in the current year is due to both an increase in the net yield on interest earning assets and an increase of million  or  in net average interest earning assets average interest earning assets less average interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread and net yield on interest earning assets for the year ended december  were and  respectively  an increase from and for the year ended december  the increase in the net yield on interest earning assets during the current year period has been the result of a period where the interest rates on deposits and borrowings have declined at a faster pace than loan interest rates 
interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased million  or  during the year ended december  to million from million earned during the prior year 
the increase was due to an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets partially offset by a decrease in yields on interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets increased million in  or  over the amount with average loans accounting for million of the increase which reflects the corporation s competitiveness within the marketplace 
yields on interest earning assets decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to in the current year 
interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december  to million 
the decrease was attributable to a decline in the average rate paid on liabilities somewhat offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended december  compared to during average interest bearing liabilities were million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase of million  or  when compared to million for the year ended december  the corporation continued to experience a shift from low cost demand and savings to higher yielding money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
in addition  the corporation continues to supplement its branch deposit network with a mix of brokered certificates of deposit  wholesale repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank borrowings 
these alternative funding sources help to lower cost of funds and provide for better management of interest rate risk 
the following table reflects the components of the corporation s net interest income for the years ended december  and including  average assets  liabilities and stockholders equity based on average daily balances  interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and net yield on interest earning assets 
nontaxable income from investment securities is presented on a tax equivalent basis assuming a statutory tax rate of for the years presented 
this was accomplished by adjusting this income upward to make it equivalent to the level of taxable income required to earn the same amount after taxes

table of contents the following table analyzes net interest income in terms of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in yields earned and rates paid on such assets and liabilities on a tax equivalent basis 
the table reflects the extent to which changes in the corporation s interest income and interest expense are attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior year rate and changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior year volume 
changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to changes due to volume and changes due to rate

on an ongoing basis  management analyzes the adequacy of this allowance by considering the nature and volume of the corporation s loan activity  financial condition of the borrower  fair market value of underlying collateral  and changes in general market conditions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operations in the appropriate period 
actual loan losses  net of recoveries  serve to reduce the allowance 
the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
the loan loss provision totaled million for the year ended december  compared to a loan loss provision of  for the year ended december  the allowance for loan loss was million  or of total loans as of december  compared to of million  or of total loans a year earlier 
nonaccrual loans increased from  or of total loans at december  to million at december   or of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses related to the impaired loans increased from  at december  to  at december  in addition  during the year ended december   the corporation charged off loans totaling million compared to loans charged off of  in the prior year 
the most significant portion of the increase in the loan loss provision and loans charged off was related to a group of loans to one borrower 
in addition  increases in the provision reflect the growth in the loan portfolio 
gross loans increased million in  from million at december  to million at december   with majority of the noted growth in the categories of commercial real estate and commercial loans 
this loan growth was a significant factor in establishing the appropriate level of allowance and the loan loss provision for the year 
in addition to the overall growth noted  the corporation considered the types of loans associated with the growth  as well as the overall seasoning of the new loans to determine the appropriate risk that was inherent in the portfolio 

table of contents in addition to these factors  the corporation evaluated the economic conditions and overall real estate climate in the primary business markets in which it operates in when considering the overall risk of the lending portfolio 
although it is clear that there has been deterioration in the economy and real estate market on a national level  the local market where the corporation operates has not been impacted as significantly 
the corporation monitors its loan portfolio and intends to continue to provide for loan loss reserves based on its ongoing periodic review of the loan portfolio and general market conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income consists of all income other than interest income and is principally derived from service charges on deposits  gain on sales of mortgage loans  income derived from bank owned life insurance  merchant processing income and income derived from debit cards and atm usage 
noninterest income decreased  or  to million for the year ended december   when compared with million for the comparable period 
fees and service charge income declined  or  as consumers and small business continue to shift to free or low balance maintenance checking products 
gains on calls and sales of securities  net were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in primarily reflects the sale of certain securities at gains in the more recent interest rate environment 
for tax purposes  the gains realized can be offset against the carryforward of unutilized capital losses 
gains on sales of mortgage loans were  for the year ended december   a decrease when compared to  for prior year 
for the current year  the corporation has experienced a decrease in mortgage activity due to the challenging real estate market 
this decrease in activity resulted in a decline in the volume of loans sold and ultimately  a decline in gains on mortgages sold 
noninterest income for the year ended december  included a gain of  related to the sale of the corporation s existing merchant services portfolio 
while the corporation will no longer service the merchants card activities  the corporation will continue to earn certain fees from ongoing portfolio and marketing activity 
noninterest income for the prior year included a  death benefit insurance payment received 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased by million or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in salaries and employee benefits  the major component of noninterest expense  increased  or 
the increase was due primarily to salary and benefits costs associated with the westwood and north haledon branches which opened in the second half of in addition  the increase in salary and benefits reflects certain newly created positions and general merit and performance increases 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased  primarily due to the expenses relating to the new branches 
in addition  fdic insurance premiums increased  for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year ended december  fdic premiums in reflected a full assessment of insurance  while fdic premiums assessed in were significantly reduced by the utilization of a one time credit issued to deposit institutions in the one time credit received by stewardship financial corporation helped reduce premiums for the first nine months of in accordance with its by laws to tithe ten percent of its pre tax profits to various charities  the corporation had charitable contributions totaling  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  over the same period in income taxes income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december   for an effective tax rate of  compared to million  for an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the decrease was a result of an increase in the percentage of nontaxable income to total income 
financial condition total assets at december  were million  an increase of million  or  over the million at december  this increase in assets reflects  among other things  an million increase in net loans held for portfolio 

table of contents loan portfolio the corporation s loan portfolio at december   net of allowance for loan losses  totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the million at december  commercial real estate mortgage loans consisting of million  or of the total portfolio  represented the largest portion of the loan portfolio 
this reflected an increase of million from million  or of the total loan portfolio at december  commercial loans increased million to million  representing of the total loan portfolio 
consumer installment loans decreased million and residential real estate mortgages decreased million 
the corporation continued its policy of selling the majority of its residential real estate loans in the secondary market 
all of these loans have been sold with servicing released 
the corporation s lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate located in northern new jersey and therefore collectibility of the loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in real estate market conditions in the northern new jersey market 
the corporation has not made loans to borrowers outside the united states 
at december   there were no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans outstanding 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions 
the following table sets forth the classification of the corporation s loans by major category at the end of the last five years december  in thousands real estate mortgage residential commercial commercial loans consumer loans installment home equity other total gross loans less allowance for loan losses deferred loan fees net loans includes automobile  home improvement  second mortgages and unsecured loans 
credit card loans are also included for all years prior to december  the following table sets forth certain categories of gross loans as of december  by contractual maturity 
borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties 
this might cause actual maturities to differ from the contractual maturities summarized below

table of contents the following table sets forth the dollar amount of all gross loans due one year or more after december   which have predetermined interest rates or floating or adjustable interest rates predetermined rates floating or adjustable rates total in thousands real estate mortgage commercial consumer asset quality the corporation s principal earning asset is its loan portfolio 
inherent in the lending function is the risk of deterioration in a borrower s ability to repay loans under existing loan agreements 
management realizes that because of this risk  reserves are maintained to absorb loan losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management of the corporation considers the risks inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activities  along with general economic and real estate market conditions 
although management attempts to establish a reserve sufficient to offset probable incurred losses in the portfolio  changes in economic conditions  regulatory policies and borrower s performance could require future changes to the allowance 
the corporation utilizes a two tier approach by identifying problem loans and allocating specific loss allowances on such loans and establishing a general valuation allowance on the remainder of its loan portfolio 
the corporation maintains a loan review system that allows for a periodic review of its loan portfolio and the early identification of potential problem loans 
such a system takes into consideration  among other things  delinquency status  size of loans  type of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers 
allocations of specific loan loss allowances are established for identified loans based on a review of such information and or appraisals of underlying collateral 
general loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loss experience  composition of loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
the corporation s accounting policies are set forth in note to the audited financial statements 
the application of some of these policies requires significant management judgment and the utilization of estimates 
actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates resulting in a significant impact on the financial statements 
a critical accounting policy for the corporation is the policy utilized in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the corporation s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory  and other conditions beyond the corporation s control 
the allowance for loan losses represents of total loans  or of non performing loans at december   compared with of total loans or times non performing loans at december  in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses totaling million is adequate to cover probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio at december  nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  loans past due days or more and accruing  and other real estate owned 
there were no other real estate owned assets for the periods presented 
the corporation s loans are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal and interest 
interest previously accrued on these loans and not yet paid is charged against income during the current period 
interest earned thereafter is only included in income to the extent that it is received in cash 
loans past due days or more and accruing represent those loans which are sufficiently collateralized and management believes all interest and principal owed will be collected 
restructured loans are loans that have been renegotiated to permit a borrower  who has incurred adverse financial circumstances  to continue to perform 
management can reduce the contractual interest rates to below market rates or make significant concessions to the terms of the loan in order for the borrower to continue to make payments

investment portfolio the corporation maintains an investment portfolio to enhance its yields and to provide a secondary source of liquidity 
the portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  us government and agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  state and political subdivision obligations and other equity investments  and has been classified as held to maturity or available for sale 
investments in debt securities that the corporation has the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost

table of contents interest rate sensitivity interest rate movements have made managing the corporation s interest rate sensitivity increasingly important 
the corporation attempts to maintain stable net interest margins by generally matching the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing  or subject to repricing  by adjusting interest rates to market conditions  and by developing new products 
one method of measuring the corporation s exposure to changes in interest rates is the maturity and repricing gap analysis 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice in a given period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
a negative gap results when the amount of interest bearing liabilities within a specified time period exceed the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period of time 
conversely  a positive gap results when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceed the amount of interest bearing liabilities mature or are repricing in the same given time frame 
the smaller the gap  the less the effect of the market volatility on net interest income 
during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position would not be in as favorable a position  as compared to an institution with a positive gap  to invest in higher yielding assets 
this may result in yields on its assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its costs of interest bearing liabilities than if it had a positive gap 
during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities  which consequently may result in its net interest income growing at a faster rate than an institution with a positive gap position 
the following table sets forth estimated maturity repricing structure of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability and adjusted for prepayment assumptions where applicable 
the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the corporation s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities  for example  prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits  is beyond the corporation s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels

table of contents the corporation also uses a simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income  net income  net interest margin  and capital to asset ratios based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of all rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
management incorporates into the model certain assumptions regarding prepayments of certain assets and liabilities 
assumptions have been built into the model for prepayments for assets and decay rates for nonmaturity deposits such as savings and interest bearing demand 
the model assumes an immediate rate shock to interest rates without management s ability to proactively change the mix of assets or liabilities 
according to the reports generated for december   an immediate interest rate increase of basis points results in a decrease in net interest income of  or million  while an immediate interest rate decrease of basis points resulted in an increase in net interest income of or  management has a goal to maintain a percentage change of no more than given a basis point change in interest rates 
management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on the corporation s net interest income 
liquidity the corporation s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities amortization and maturities of investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flow and prepayments on loan and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the corporation s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of its operating  investing and financing activities 
these activities are summarized below years ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents beginning operating activities net income adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents ending 
cash was generated by operating activities in each of the above periods 
the primary source of cash from operating activities during each period was net income 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments  such as federal funds sold 
the corporation enters into commitments to extend credit  such as letters of credit  which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements
