item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview astrotech was formed in to leverage the environment of space for commercial purposes 
for the last years  the company has remained a crucial player in space commerce activities 
we have supported the launch of shuttle missions and more than spacecraft  building space hardware and processing facilities  and preparing and processing scientific research for microgravity 
we offer products and services in the following areas facilities and support services necessary for the preparation of satellites and payloads for launch 
end to end mission assurance a turn key approach to the total satellite lifecycle 
commercialization of space based technologies into real world applications 
expertise in qualifying hardware for spaceflight and the habitability and occupational challenges of space 
our business units astrotech space operations aso aso provides all necessary support for its government and commercial customers to successfully process complex communication  earth observation and deep space satellites in preparation for their launch on a variety of domestic and foreign launch vehicles 
processing activities include satellite ground transportation  pre launch hardware integration and testing  satellite encapsulation  fueling  launch pad delivery  and communication linked launch control 
our aso facilities can accommodate five meter class satellites encompassing the majority of us based satellite preparation services 
in addition to satellite processing  aso offers engineering services capabilities that encompass the entire life cycle of a satellite 
during fiscal year  aso accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
revenue for our aso business unit is generated from various fixed priced contracts with launch service providers in both the commercial and government markets 
the services and facilities we provide to our customers support the final assembly  checkout  and countdown functions associated with preparing a spacecraft for launch 
the earnings and cash flows generated from our aso operations are related to the number of spacecraft launches  which reflects the growth in the satellite based communications industries and the requirement to replace aging satellites 
other factors that have impacted  and are expected to continue to impact earnings and cash flows for this business include our ability to control our capital expenditures  which primarily are limited to modifications to accommodate payload processing for new launch vehicles  upgrading communications infrastructure and other building improvements 
the continuing limited availability of competing facilities at the major domestic launch sites that can offer comparable services  leading to an increase in government use of our services 
our ability to complete customer specified facility modifications within budgeted costs and time commitments 
our ability to control and reduce costs in order to maximize profitability of our fixed priced contracts 
new business initiatives our identified new business initiatives are focused on commercialization of space based technologies  which is a natural extension of our years of space industry experience and our core capabilities in these fields 
these new business initiatives will require varying investments of capital and technical expertise 
other our other business unit is an incubator envisioned to commercialize space industry technologies into real world applications to be sold to consumers and industry 
the st detect miniature chemical detector  astrogenetix microgravity processing platform and the airward hazardous cargo containers are all initiatives developed under our other business unit 
the st detect chemical detector offers a low power  portable detection device for a variety of applications 
st detect has been awarded a developmental testing and evaluation designation from the us department of homeland security as a promising anti terrorism technology and is the recipient of a phase i award from the us army s chemical and biological defense cbd small business innovation research sbir program 
astrogenetix is performing drug discovery in microgravity as part of the national lab pathfinder missions designed by nasa and has identified a vaccine candidate for salmonella 
airward is a shipping container designed to meet the specific requirements of the us department of transportation for all commercial airlines in us airspace to protect pressurized oxygen bottles from flame and heat during flight

critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
revenue is derived primarily from contracts with the us government and commercial customers 
revenues under these contracts are recognized using the methods described below 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits is a process requiring a high degree of judgment by our management 
see risk factors risks related to our business our financial results could be affected if the estimates that we use in accounting for contracts are incorrect and need to be changed 
we base our estimate on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including the negotiation of equitable adjustments to our fixed price contracts due to launch delays 
costs to complete our contracts include  when appropriate  material  labor  subcontracting costs  lease costs  commissions  insurance  and depreciation 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period that the change in estimate occurs 
a summary of revenue recognition methods follows services products provided contract type method of revenue recognition payload processing facilities firm fixed price mission specific ratably  over the occupancy period of a satellite within the facility from arrival through launch firm fixed price guaranteed number of missions for multi year contract payments recognized ratably over the contract period commercial space habitat modules  integration operations support services and construction contracts 
firm fixed price percentage of completion based on costs incurred configuration management  engineering services cost reimbursable award fixed fee reimbursable costs incurred plus award fixed fee commercial products specific purchase order based at shipment  based primarily on criteria of sab long lived asset 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  fixed assets  assets under construction and intangible assets  we evaluate the recoverability of those assets in accordance with the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell
