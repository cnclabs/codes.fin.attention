item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information in item above and our historical consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
overview and developments we are an independent energy company focused on the exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil in the united states 
our oil and natural gas reserves and operations are concentrated in two rocky mountain basins 
our corporate strategy is to internally identify prospects  acquire lands encompassing those prospects and evaluate those prospects using subsurface geology and geophysical data and exploratory drilling 
using this strategy  we have developed an oil and natural gas portfolio of proved reserves  as well as conventional and unconventional prospects  that we have the opportunity to explore  drill and develop 
our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by the success of our exploration and land leasing activity  the resulting production and reserves  oil and natural gas commodity prices  and the costs related to operating our properties 
in  we invested capital of million in our oil and gas operations including million spent on drilling  completion and related infrastructure and million spent on land leasing and geological and geophysical data 
our original net capital expenditures were planned to be million in  please see the section liquidity and capital resources below for further information 
although we have not obtained significant production with these expenditures  this investment has provided us with a platform to build on as we further develop our exploration plays 
our acreage position acquired in in the bakken play of dunn county  north dakota will  we believe  prove to be one of the most exciting developments onshore north america  although because of a national decline in oil and gas prices and oil and gas exploration activity in this area has generally slowed down 
although during we continued to expand our acreage position in dunn county  north dakota  we are presently very selective on acreage acquisitions  with leasing activity involving mostly small parcels which fill in our acreage block 
the moccasin creek mc h well kodiak operates with wi and net revenue interest 
nri 
reached total depth in early january the well  located in the southwestern portion of kodiak s leasehold  was drilled to an approximate total vertical depth tvd of  feet and a total measured depth tmd of  feet 
a liner was run to total depth 
the drilling rig was then skid approximately feet where drilling recently finished on the mc h well kodiak operates with wi and nri 
the mc h reached total depth in early february the well was drilled to a tvd of  feet and a tmd of  feet 
these two wells were drilled under a participation agreement entered into with a private  third party oil and gas company in november under this participation agreement  kodiak paid of the first wells drilling costs for its working interest wi 
drilling costs of the second well drilled were paid in proportion to the non promoted working interest of each party 
completion work for both the mc h and mc h is scheduled for the spring of completion costs will be paid in the same manner as the drilling costs discussed above 
as of december   we had estimated proved reserves of billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas and thousand barrels mbbls of oil with a present value discounted at of million 
our reserves are proved developed and are comprised of natural gas and crude oil on an energy equivalent basis 
our december   reserves reflect a downward revision of the december   reserves of boe  primarily related to a change in commodity prices  and a revision of our previously recorded proved undeveloped locations pud 
table of contents we had gas sales in of mcf per day and crude oil sales of barrels per day 
this was an increase of for gas sales and decrease for oil sales over the volumes sold in during  our revenues from oil and gas sales decreased by million or to million 
lower sales volumes accounted for million of the decline  partially offset by a positive effect of million  due to increased prices in versus total oil and gas production expenses increased to million in from million in of the million increase in  million is attributed to well workover operations charged to expense during the year 
our revenues are directly affected by oil and natural gas commodity prices  which can fluctuate dramatically 
the commodity prices are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
during recent years  including and into  we have seen significant volatility in oil and natural gas prices 
the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets has lead to a worldwide economic recession 
the slowdown in economic activity caused by such recession has reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
oil prices declined from record levels in early july of over per bbl to below per bbl in december  while natural gas prices have declined from over per mcf to below per mcf over the same period 
in addition  our forecasted prices for have also declined 
we believe that spot market prices reflect worldwide concerns about the global economy  producers ability to ensure sufficient supply to meet increasing demand amid a host of uncertainties caused by political instability  a fluctuating us dollar  and crude oil refining and natural gas infrastructure constraint 
prices we have received have varied widely depending on commodity and location of salespoints 
in  we experienced record crude oil prices in the williston basin while in wyoming we elected to shut in gas production because of extremely low natural gas prices 
overall  the average crude oil price we received for the year was per barrel versus per barrel in  while our average gas price received was per mcf compared to per mcf in in  our financial position and results of operations were affected significantly by an asset impairment related to the carrying value of our developed properties 
during  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million related to our oil and gas drilling operations and related infrastructure 
except for wells currently in progress  these expenditures increased the company s full cost pool  but did not add proportionately to our proved reserves present value calculated under the current sec guidelines 
the value of kodiak s proved reserves as calculated quarterly throughout the year did not exceed the costs included in the full cost pool 
consequently the company recorded a cumulative asset impairment of million during outlook our activities will be subject to two significant factors i oil and natural gas prices coupled with the cost of exploration and development activities  and ii our available working capital and ability to pay for or finance proposed activities 
subject to those issues  in  we expect to continue a multiple well drilling program in our eastern bakken play in dunn county  north dakota 
we have projected as many as nine additional wells that we could participate in during subject to economic conditions and drilling results  although currently we do not have the resources necessary to complete these activities 
this number could be decreased if the current commodity environment persists throughout the year or if we are unable to pay our share of the operations 
in the vermillion basin our activity will be significantly influenced by gas prices and we do not expect much activity in as the majority of our acreage is held within federal units we are obligated to only spend limited capital during the year 
the current global economic and financial crisis could lead to an extended national or global economic recession 
a slowdown in economic activity caused by an extended recession would likely 
table of contents reduce national and worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower commodity prices 
substantial decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  could further limit our access to liquidity and credit and could hinder our ability to satisfy our capital requirements 
capital and credit markets have experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption during the last half of and continue to be unpredictable 
given the current levels of market volatility and disruption  the availability of funds from those markets has diminished substantially 
further  arising from concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of accessing the credit markets has increased as many lenders have raised interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards or altogether ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
due to current capital and credit market conditions  we cannot be certain that funding will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company 
our current cash balances and cash flow from operations will not alone be sufficient to provide working capital to fully fund our original plan of operations 
accordingly  we intend to pursue alternatives  such as joint ventures with third parties or sales of interest in one or more of our properties 
such transactions may result in a reduction in our operating interests or require us to relinquish the right to operate the property 
there can be no assurance that any such transactions can be completed or that such transactions will satisfy our operating capital requirements 
if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  we would be required to curtail our expenditures or restructure our operations  and we would be unable to implement our original exploration and drilling program  either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we have historically financed our operations  property acquisitions and capital investments from the proceeds of private offerings of our equity securities and  more recently to a limited extent  from cash generated from operations 
we do not currently generate sustaining cash flow from our oil and gas operations  although our future depends on our ability to generate oil and natural gas operating cash flow 
as of december   we had working capital of million as compared to million at december   and no outstanding long term debt 
the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the three years ended december   and for the years ended ended december  capital resources and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at end of the period net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash flow the decrease in cash provided by operations from to is primarily from our workover activities on three wells which decreased our sales volumes and increased our operating expense 
during  we charged  of workover expense to lease operating expense  resulting in decreased cash flow 
these decreases in cash provided by operations were partially offset by record high prices for crude oil and natural gas through the first half of the decrease in cash provided by operations from to is primarily from changes in accounts payable decreasing cash by 
table of contents  due to settlement of outstanding payables in and a  or increase in general and administrative cost due to the addition of employees in these decreases in cash provided by operations were partially offset by a  or increase in oil and gas revenues from to the oil and gas revenue decrease in from was primarily due to a decrease in oil sales volume 
the oil and gas revenue increases in and were primarily due to drilling activity 
our investing activities during the three years ended december  related primarily to the addition of oil and gas leases and oil and gas drilling activities 
we recorded  in development and exploration costs in   in and  in the remaining investing activity during  and consisted primarily of equipment additions and changes in our restricted investments 
our financing activities during were comprised mainly of a public offering of  shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million 
the company paid approximately million in commissions and expenses 
our financing activities during were comprised mainly of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
our financing activities during included the private placement of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately  in march and the private placement of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately  in december as we operate the majority of our acreage  specifically the eastern bakken acreage  we have the ability to adjust our drilling schedule to reflect the changing commodity price environment 
should we sell off some of our acreage and give up the right to operate  we will become subject to obligations imposed by others  without the ability to control our drilling schedule 
since we have not drawn against our credit facility at december   our primary obligations are our office lease and our two drilling rig contracts 
during the second quarter of  we entered into two year contracts for the use of two new build drilling rigs 
the first rig was placed into operation in november and entails a two year drilling commitment or specific termination fees if drilling activity is cancelled 
agreement terms require utilization of the rig and payment of day rates or the payment of standby rates if the rig is not utilized 
the estimated termination fee for the first rig is approximately million as of december  the termination fee on the first rig will continue to decrease as long as the rig remains active 
delivery of the second rig has been placed on hold with the drilling contractor 
in the event we do not to take delivery of the rig  the termination fee could be up to million and terms are still being negotiated 
subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter  we were able to negotiate with the drilling contractor an approximate reduction in rig day rates for the rig that is currently operating 
we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory resolution to this issue 
both we and the rig owner are attempting to find another company that will take over our obligations  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
all of our leases on the fbir have a minimum of nearly three and a half years remaining  therefore we do not have to drill wells in order to preserve our lease position 
we continue to monitor our overhead costs and are attempting to adjust and stay in line with the decline in commodity prices 
in september we executed a million credit facility with bank of the west  na 
the borrowing base  reflecting the maximum amount that may be outstanding under the credit facility at any time  is million as of december  the borrowing base will be re determined on may  and thereafter semi annually each may and november if oil and natural gas prices significantly decline for an extended period of time  our lender could reestablish the borrowing base by evaluating our reserves at substantially lower oil and natural gas prices 
such determination could result in a negative revision to our proved reserve value and reduce our borrowing base 
currently the facility is undrawn  and we have no long term debt 

table of contents if we borrow funds  we will be obligated to make periodic interest or other debt service payments and may be subject to additional restrictive covenants 
the ability to borrow funds is dependent on a number of variables  including our proved reserves  and assumptions regarding the price at which oil and natural gas can be sold 
should we seek to raise additional capital through the issuance and sale of equity securities  the sales  if successfully completed  may be at prices below the market price of our stock  and our shareholders may suffer significant dilution 
in order to fund our and later years capital expenditures  we will complete one or a combination of the following options  whichever option s is are most favorable issuance of public equity issuance of public debt capital sharing arrangements with oil and gas industry partners sell down of interest in existing properties terminate drilling rig contracts and pay a penalty to drilling contractor under the terms of the contract if we are not able to find another company to take over the drilling contractor obligations our ability to fund our operations in future periods will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  additional joint ventures or selling interests in our existing acreage 
our ability to succeed in any of these capital raising activities will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly in light of the current widespread economic downturn 
we had working capital of million inclusive of cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  our working capital included million of prepaid tubular goods for the first six wells of our drilling program  which have been reported as prepaid expenses as we have not taken physical delivery of the goods as of december  these costs will be applied to our share of the drilling costs for the first six wells  or will be recovered from our drilling partners 
based on our original drilling and exploration program  the company anticipated that our capital expenditures in the williston basin would be approximately million 
while we cannot fully assess our capital expenditures or the timing of expenditures in the vermillion basin as we do not operate the properties  we anticipate that two of the wells that were horizontally drilled during could be completed during these costs cannot be determined at this time due to the uncertainty of commodity prices and expenditures 
we estimated that our share of the completion costs would not exceed million 
operating results fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas sales revenues increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of  of the increase was due to a increase in volume and  of the increase was due to a increase in average price 
natural gas sales volumes were  mcf for the year ended december   compared to  mcf for the same period in and the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was per mcf in compared to per mcf in during the fourth quarter of  natural gas prices in wyoming declined to a level that we have decided to shut in our wyoming operated wells until prices improve 

table of contents oil sales revenues 
oil sales revenues decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for this decrease is attributed to a  negative impact due to a decrease in volume offset and by a  positive impact due to a increase in average price 
during the second and third quarter of  three operated oil wells were shut in pending workover and completion activities 
this contributed to the decline in our oil sales volumes to  barrels for compared to  barrels for the same period in  whereas the average price we realized on the sale of our oil increased to per barrel for the year ended december   from for the same period in interest income 
interest income decreased by  to  in from  for the same period in due to a decrease in average investible cash throughout the year 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in the increase is primarily due to workover expense of  recorded during the year 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dda expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense decreased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in due to impairment charges taken in and  the full cost pool was lower resulting in a lower dda charge for asset impairment 
during the last half of  crude oil and natural gas prices dropped from their highs set in the summer of and the company s full cost pool exceeded the ceiling by approximately million after taking into account decrease in prices following the period ends 
subsequent to the end of the third and fourth quarters of  there was no recovery in price and therefore impairment expenses of million and million were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
in  we recorded an impairment of million primarily as the result of our inability to establish production and qualified reserves in its deep vermillion basin project  uneconomic natural gas prices in wyoming  and the impairment of certain undeveloped properties in wyoming and north dakota 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in included in the general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended december  is a stock based compensation charge of  for options issued to officers  directors and employees compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   also reflects an increase in our level of activity and an increase in the number of employees 
as of december   we had full time employees and two contract consultants as compared to full time employees and three contract consultants at december  salary and related expenses decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  in this decrease is due to the reduction in employee bonuses in versus  partially offset by the addition of two new employees in gain on currency exchange 
in  a decrease in the value of the canadian dollar resulted in a loss of  on currency exchange as compared to a gain in of  net loss 
our net loss increased by  to a net loss of  for the year ended december   from a net loss of  for as more fully described above  the asset impairment of  in was the primary cause of the increase as compared to an asset 
table of contents impairment charge of  in in addition  the decrease in oil production revenue  interest income and the increase in oil and gas production expense contributed to the increase in net loss 
adjusted ebitda 
our adjusted ebitda decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of as shown in the following table  this decrease is the primarily the result of decreased revenues and increased production and general and administrative expenses 
for further discussion of this non gaap measure and a reconciliation of this measure to net income  see non gaap financial measure in item of this k 
for the year ended december  change oil and gas production revenues interest revenue total revenue oil and gas production expense general and administrative expense excluding stock compensation adjusted ebitda fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas sales revenues increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of increased natural gas sales volumes more than offset price declines between the periods 
natural gas sales volumes were  mcf for the year ended december   compared to  mcf for the same period in  whereas the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas declined by to per mcf 
the increase in gas production volumes is due to an increase in the number of operating gas wells  from six wells in to fourteen in the increased sales were partially offset by reduced volumes due to shutting in wells during the third and fourth quarters of as a result of low natural gas prices received for our vermillion basin production 
oil sales revenues 
oil sales revenues increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for in  we benefited from both increased oil sales volumes and higher realized oil prices 
oil sales volumes were  barrels for compared to  barrels for the same period in  whereas the average price we realized on the sale of our oil increased by to per barrel for the year ended december   from for the same period in the increase in oil sales volumes are a result of having a full year s production for wells drilled during as well as two additional wells drilled and completed in interest income 
interest income increased by  to  in from  for the same period in the increase was due to the investment of funds received from our december sale of shares of our common stock 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in the increase is partially due to an increase in lease operating expense reflecting our growing production base and number of producing wells 
also  severance taxes increased due to increased revenues from growing sales volumes and higher prices and the expiration of incentive production taxes 

table of contents depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dda expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in the increase reflects our growing depletable and depreciable asset base and our production base 
overall the rate of dda expense has increased from per barrel of oil equivalent to per boe 
this increase was impacted by the addition of expenditures related to our exploration and development activities to our depletable basis  or full cost pool  without a proportionate increase in proved reserves 
additionally  because of changes in development plans and the drilling of unproductive wells  certain leasehold costs were impaired which increased the full cost pool 
asset impairment 
as of march   based on current oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf  the company s full cost pool exceeded the present value of the company s estimated future net revenue discounted at 
therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended march  based on the company s evaluation of oil and gas reserves at september   using weighted average realized oil and gas prices of per barrel of crude oil and per mcf of natural gas  the company s full cost pool again exceeded the ceiling limitation by approximately million and an impairment expense was recorded for this amount during the quarter ended september  the year to date impairment of  is primarily the result of the company s inability to establish production and qualified reserves in its deep vermillion basin project  uneconomic natural gas prices in wyoming  and the impairment of certain undeveloped properties in wyoming and north dakota 
as with many resource plays in the early stages of development  significant expenditures have been and will continue to be required to understand the parameters of the deep vermillion basin play 
as of december   we have drilled four exploratory wells in the baxter  frontier  and dakota formations to better understand the resource potential 
in the second half of  we focused on acquiring additional geologic and geophysical data from these wells and the acquisition and interpretation of an extensive seismic study over the northern portion of our acreage 
while we are optimistic about the long term potential of this prospect we have not established significant proved reserves for the deep vermillion basin 
as a result  the value of the development to date calculated under sec guidelines does not offset the cost of the wells and related acreage in the full cost pool 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended december   from  for the same period in included in the general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended december  is a stock based compensation charge of  for options issued to officers  directors and employees compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   also reflects an increase in our level of activity and an increase in the number of employees and related salary and payroll expense 
as of december   we had fifteen full time employees and three contract consultants  as compared to full time employees at december  salary and related expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  in in  we also incurred additional costs of  related to outside consulting services and additional audit requirements as a result of the adoption of section of sarbanes oxley 
gain on currency exchange 
in  we benefited from an increase in the value of our canadian dollars with a  gain on currency exchange as compared to a loss in of  our canadian dollar balance has largely been converted to us dollars as of year end so we do not expect similar gains in the future 

table of contents net loss 
our net loss increased by  to a net loss of  for the year ended december   from a net loss of  for as more fully described above  the asset impairment of  was the primary cause of the increase 
in addition  the increases in our oil and natural gas production revenues  interest income and gain on currency exchange were more than offset by increases in oil and natural gas production expense  depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability expenses and general and administrative expenses 
adjusted ebitda 
our adjusted ebitda increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of as shown in the following table  this increase is the primarily the result of increased oil and gas revenues only partially offset by increased production expenses and general and administrative expenses 
for further discussion of this non gaap measure and a reconciliation of this measure to net income  see non gaap financial measure in item of this k 
for the year ended december  change oil and gas production revenues interest revenue total revenue oil and gas production expense general and administrative expense excluding stock compensation adjusted ebitda financial instruments and other instruments as at december   we had cash  accounts payable and accrued liabilities which are carried at approximate fair value because of the short maturity date of those instruments 
our management believes that we are not exposed to significant interest  currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments 
research and development as an exploration stage natural resource company  we do not normally engage in research and there were no development activities  or research and development expenditures made in the last three fiscal years 
trend information during the first nine month of  our industry has experienced a significant increase in the cost of drilling rigs and related oil field services 
during most of and  drilling rigs were difficult to contract and we could not be assured that we could secure third party services 
at the close of and continuing into  due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices  many drilling rigs were idled and the availability of drilling rigs has increased 
during  commodity prices were at or near all time levels and we experienced the decline of crude oil and gas from record highs in july of per barrel for crude oil and per mcf of natural gas to below per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas at year end currently  qualified employees are more readily available  however we still must compete for employees within our industry 
some or all of these situations are likely to have a material effect upon our net sales or revenues  income from continuing operations  profitability  liquidity or capital resources  or cause reported financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial condition 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table lists as of december   information with respect to our known contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term obligations office facilities drilling rig obligations during the second quarter of  the company entered into two year contracts for the use of two new build drilling rigs 
the first rig was placed into operation in november and entails a two year drilling commitment or specific termination fees if drilling activity is cancelled 
the terms of that agreement require utilization of the rig and payment of day rates or the payment of standby rates if the rig is not utilized 
the estimated termination fee for the first rig is approximately million as of december  the termination fee on the first rig will continue to decrease as long as we keep the rig active 
our second rig has been placed on hold with the drilling contractor 
we are negotiating with the rig contractor to either cancel or delay our obligation with respect to the second rig and avoid all or a part of the contractual million cancellation penalty 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  the company may at times have commitments in place to reserve or earn certain acreage positions or wells 
if the company does not pay such commitments  the acreage positions or wells may be lost 
we have not included asset retirement obligations as discussed in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  as we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals in the united states  or gaap  requires our management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 
oil and natural gas reserves we believe estimated reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows are the most important estimates made by an exploration and production company such as ours because they affect the perceived value of our company  are used in comparative financial analysis ratios  and are used as the basis for the most significant accounting estimates in our financial statements  including the periodic calculation of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
we determine anticipated future cash inflows and future production and development costs 
table of contents by applying benchmark prices and costs  including transportation  quality and basis differentials  in effect at the end of each period to the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas remaining to be produced as of the end of that period 
we reduce expected cash flows to present value using a discount rate that depends upon the purpose for which the reserve estimates will be used 
for example  the standardized measure calculation required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities  requires us to apply a discount rate 
although reserve estimates are inherently imprecise  and estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than those of established proved producing oil and natural gas properties  we make considerable effort to estimate our reserves  including through the use of independent reserves engineering consultants 
we expect that periodic reserve estimates will change in the future as additional information becomes available or as oil and natural gas prices and operating and capital costs change 
we evaluate and estimate our oil and natural gas reserves as of december of each year and at other such times throughout the year that we deem appropriate 
for purposes of depletion  depreciation  and impairment  we adjust reserve quantities at all interim periods for the estimated impact of acquisitions and dispositions 
changes in depletion  depreciation or impairment calculations caused by changes in reserve quantities or net cash flows are recorded in the period in which the reserves or net cash flow estimate changes 
impairment of long lived assets we record our property and equipment at cost 
the cost of our unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until such a time as the properties are either developed or abandoned 
we review these properties quarterly for possible impairment 
we provide an impairment allowance on unproved property when we determine that the property will not be developed or the carrying value will not be realized 
we evaluate the reliability of our proved properties and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recording of impairment may be appropriate 
our impairment test compares the expected undiscounted future net revenue from a property  using escalated pricing  with the related net capitalized costs of the property at the end of the applicable period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenue of a property  the cost of the property is added to the full cost pool 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and of the forward looking statements contained in our analysis of liquidity and capital resources 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil 
we report revenue as the gross amounts we receive before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs  which are reported as separate expenses 
we record revenue in the month our production is delivered to the purchaser  but payment is generally received to days after the date of production 
at the end of each month  we make estimates of the amount of production that we delivered to the purchaser and the price we will receive 
we use our knowledge of our properties  their historical performance  the anticipated effect of weather conditions during the month of production  nymex and local spot market prices and other factors as the basis for these estimates 
we record the variances between our estimates and the actual amounts we receive in the month payment is received 
asset retirement obligations we are required to recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties including without limitation the costs of reclamation of our drilling sites  storage and transmission facilities and access roads 
we base our estimate of the liability on the industry experience of our management and on our current understanding of federal and state regulatory requirements 
our present value calculations require us to estimate the economic lives of 
table of contents our properties  assume what future inflation rates apply to external estimates and determine the credit adjusted risk free rate to use 
our estimated asset retirement obligations are reflected in our depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations over the remaining life of our oil and gas properties 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement requires us to record expense associated with the fair value of stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate stock based compensation 
oil and natural gas properties full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
these costs include land acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenses  carrying charges on non producing properties  costs of drilling and overhead charges directly related to acquisition and exploration activities 
capitalized costs  together with the costs of production equipment  are depleted and amortized on the unit of production method based on the estimated gross proved reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
for this purpose  we convert our petroleum products and reserves to a common unit of measure 
costs of acquiring and evaluating unproved properties are initially excluded from depletion calculations 
these unevaluated properties are assessed quarterly to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
when proved reserves are assigned or the property is considered to be impaired  the cost of the property or the amount of the impairment is added to the full cost pool and becomes subject to depletion calculations 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are applied against capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless the sale would alter the rate of depletion by more than 
royalties paid  net of any tax credits  received are netted against oil and natural gas sales 
in applying the full cost method  we perform a ceiling test on properties that restricts the capitalized costs less accumulated depletion from exceeding an amount equal to the estimated undiscounted value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
the estimated future revenues are based on sales prices achievable under existing contracts and posted average reference prices in effect at the end of the applicable period  and current costs  and after deducting estimated future general and administrative expenses  production related expenses  financing costs  future site restoration costs and income taxes 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and natural gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  we would recognize an impairment 
foreign currency fluctuations monetary items denominated in a foreign currency  other than us dollars  are converted into us dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our primary market risk consists of market changes in oil and natural gas prices 
prospective revenues from the sale of products or properties will be impacted by oil and natural gas prices 
a per mcf change in the market price of natural gas would result in a change of approximately  in our gross gas production revenue for the fiscal year ended december  a per barrel change in the market price of oil would result in a change of approximately  in our gross oil production revenue for the fiscal year ended december  the impact on any potential sale of property cannot be readily determined 
interest rate risk we currently maintain some of our available cash in redeemable short term investments  classified as cash equivalents  and our reported interest income from these short term investments could be adversely affected by any material changes in us dollar interest rates 
a change in the interest rate would result in a change of approximately  in our interest income for the fiscal year ended december  if all of our cash were invested in interest bearing notes
