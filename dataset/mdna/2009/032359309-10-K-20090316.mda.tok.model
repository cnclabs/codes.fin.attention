insurance  particularly workers compensation  is  generally  affected by seasonality 
the first quarter generally produces greater premiums than subsequent quarters 
nevertheless  the impact of seasonality on our small commercial business and specialty middle market segments has not been significant 
we believe that this is because we serve many small businesses in different geographic locations 
in addition  we believe seasonality may be muted by our acquisition activity 
one of the key financial measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance is return on average equity 
our return on average equity was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our overall financial objective is to produce a return on average equity of or more over the long term 
in addition  we target a net combined ratio of or lower over the long term  while seeking to maintain optimal operating leverage in our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our am best rating objectives 
our net combined ratio was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a key factor in achieving our targeted net combined ratio is improvement of our net expense ratio 
our strategy across our segments is to maintain premium rates  deploy capital judiciously  manage our expenses and focus on the sectors in which we have expertise  which we believe will provide opportunities for greater returns 
investment income is an important part of our business 
because the period of time between our receipt of premiums and the ultimate settlement of claims is often several years or longer  we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time 
as a result  we are able to generate more investment income from our premiums as compared to insurance companies that operate in many other lines of business 
our net investment income was million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the company held and of total invested assets in cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  respectively 
this relatively high concentration of cash and cash equivalents represents our reaction to the relatively flat debt yield curve and should enable the company to quickly redeploy substantial assets should the interest rate environment change 
our most significant balance sheet liability is our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid are not discounted using present value factors 
our loss reserves are reviewed at least annually by our external actuaries 
reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims 
these estimates are inherently uncertain 
judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances 
the interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces  principally frequency and severity of future claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  inflation of medical costs and wages  insurance policy coverage interpretations  jury determinations and legislative changes 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
if we change our estimates  these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made  with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings 
the use of reinsurance is an important component of our business strategy 
see business reinsurance 
as losses are incurred and recorded  we record amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers for the portion of the paid and unpaid losses ceded to the reinsurers 
we have purchased reinsurance for our small commercial business segment  which also reinsures the workers compensation portion of the specialty middle market property and casualty business we recently acquired 
we purchased reinsurance to cover the property portion of this business 
at present  we do not plan to reinsure the general liability and auto liability portions of this business

principal revenue and expense items gross premium written 
gross premium written represents estimated premiums from each insurance policy that we write  including as part of an assigned risk plan  during a reporting period based on the effective date of the individual policy 
certain policies that are underwritten by the company are subject to premium audit at that policy s cancellation or expiration 
the final actual gross premiums written may vary from the original estimate based on changes to the final rating parameters or classifications of the policy 
net premium written 
net premium written are gross premiums written less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements 
the amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement 
net premium earned 
net premium earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written 
insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy 
at the end of each reporting period  premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy 
our workers compensation insurance policies typically have a term of one year 
thus  for a one year policy written on july  for an employer with a constant payroll during the term of the policy  we would earn half of the premiums in and the other half in our 
table of contents specialty risk and extended warranty coverages are earned over the estimated exposure time period 
the terms vary depending on the risk and have an average duration of approximately months  but range in duration from one month to months 
ceding commission revenues 
commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies  generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured 
net investment income and realized gains and losses 
we invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities primarily in cash and cash equivalents  fixed maturity and equity securities 
our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets 
net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income 
net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable 
net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable  or are written down as a result of other than temporary impairment 
we classify equity securities and most of our fixed maturity securities as available for sale and the remainder of our fixed maturity securities as held to maturity 
net unrealized gains losses on those securities classified as available for sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
commission and fee income 
we recognize commission and fee revenue as a servicing carrier for the arkansas  indiana  illinois  georgia and virginia assigned risk plans 
in addition  we also offer claims adjusting and loss control services for fees to unaffiliated third parties 
we also recognize fee income associated with the issuance of workers compensation policies for installment fees  in jurisdictions where it is permitted and approved  and reinstatement fees  fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non payment  in jurisdictions where it is permitted and approved 
our specialty risk and extended warranty business generates fee revenue for product warranty registration and claims handling services provided to unaffiliated third parties 
we also recognize brokerage and asset management fees in association with our reinsurance agreement with maiden 
loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
loss and loss adjustment expenses lae incurred represent our largest expense item and  for any given reporting period  include estimates of future claim payments  changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and servicing claims 
these expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure 
we record loss and loss adjustment expenses related to estimates of future claim payments based on case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience 
it is typical for our more serious bodily injury claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of injured employees and claimants and the costs of their medical treatment 
our ability to estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability 
acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses consist of policy acquisition expenses  salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses 
these items are described below policy acquisition expenses comprise commissions directly attributable to those agents  wholesalers or brokers that produce premiums written on our behalf 
in most instances  commissions are paid based on collected premium  which reduces our credit risk exposure associated with producers in case a policyholder does not pay a premium 
we pay state and local taxes  licenses and fees  assessments and contributions to various state workers compensation guaranty funds based on our premiums or losses in each state 
surcharges that the company may be required to charge insureds in certain jurisdictions are considered accrued liabilities  rather than expense 
salaries and benefits expenses are those salaries and benefits expenses for employees that are directly involved in the origination  issuance and maintenance of policies  claims adjustment and accounting for insurance transactions 
salaries and benefits associated with employees that are involved in fee generating activities are classified as other expenses 

table of contents general and administrative expenses are comprised of other costs associated with the company s insurance activities such as federal excise tax  postage  telephones and internet access charges as well as legal and auditing fees and board and bureau charges 
other 
other expenses include those charges that are related to the non insurance fee generating activities in which the company engages  including salaries and benefits expenses and other charges directly attributable to non insurance fee generating activities as well amortization of tangible and intangible assets 
interest expense 
interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then applicable interest rates 
income tax expense 
we incur federal income tax expense as well as income tax expense in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
net loss ratio 
the net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of net losses and lae incurred to net premiums earned 
net expense ratio 
the net expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company s operational efficiency in administering its business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission to net premiums earned 
net combined ratio 
the net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company s overall underwriting profit 
this is the sum of the net loss and net expense ratios 
if the net combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
return on equity 
return on equity is calculated by dividing net income net income excludes results of discontinued operations as well as any currency gain or loss associated with discontinued operations on an after tax basis by the average of shareholders equity 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
these policies require us to make estimates and assumptions 
the company s management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates and assumptions used with the audit committee of the board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results in future periods might differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses  including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date  amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers  assessments  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  the impairment of investment securities  goodwill and other intangible assets and the valuation of stock based compensation 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies 
premiums 
insurance premiums  other than specialty risk and extended warranty  are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the contract period 
insurance premiums on specialty risk and extended warranty are earned based on estimated program coverage periods 
these estimates are based on the expected distribution of coverage periods by contract at inception  because a single contract may contain multiple coverage period options and these estimates are revised based on the actual coverage periods selected by the insured 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired term of the contract or policy in force 
premium adjustments on contracts and audit premiums are based on estimates made over the contract period 
the company also estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of premium 
the company reviews its bad debt write offs at least annually and adjusts its premium percentage as required 
allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 

table of contents ceding commission revenue 
commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies  generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured 
certain reinsurance agreements contain provisions whereby the ceding commission rates vary based on the loss experience under the agreements 
the company records ceding commission revenue based on its current estimate of subject losses 
the company records adjustments to the ceding commission revenue in the period that changes in the estimated losses are determined 
reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
in establishing our reserves  we do not use loss discounting  which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we utilize a combination of the company s incurred loss development factors and industry wide incurred loss development factors 
our actuary generates a range within which it is reasonably likely that our ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses will fall 
the low end of the range is established by assigning a weight of to our ultimate losses obtained by application of the company s own loss development factors and to our ultimate losses developed through application of industry wide loss development factors 
the high end is established by assigning a weight of each to our ultimate losses as developed through application of company and industry wide loss development factors 
the determination to assign particular weights to ultimate losses developed through application of company loss development factors and industry wide loss development factors is made by our actuary and is a matter of actuarial judgment 
in connection with the generation of the range  we have not made any shifts in the relative weights assigned to ultimate losses developed through application of company and industry wide loss development factors 
however  in the selection of our reserves  the company  based on the increasing amount of its own historical data to rely upon  has given greater consideration to the results attributable to its own loss development factors 
nevertheless  we continue to record our reserves at the higher end of the range  above the midpoint  which we believe to be prudent in light of the uncertainty inherent in estimating reserves 
we believe this method  which tracks the development of claims incurred in a particular time period  is the best method for projecting our ultimate liability 
these factors are dependent on a number of elements  including frequency and severity of claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  projected inflation of medical costs and wages for workers compensation  insurance policy coverage interpretations  judicial determinations and existing laws and regulations 
the predictive ability of loss development factors is dependent on consistent underwriting  claims handling  and inflation  among other factors  and predictable legislatively and judicially imposed legal requirements 
if all things remain equal  losses incurred in should develop similarly to losses incurred in and prior years 
thus  if the net loss ratio for premiums written in year one is we expect that the net loss ratio for premiums written in year two also would be 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty in the loss development factors  our actual liabilities may differ significantly from our original estimates 
notwithstanding the inherent uncertainty  the company has not experienced material variability in its loss development factors 
we believe that it is reasonably likely that we could experience a deviation in our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves due to changes in the elements that underlie loss development  such as claims frequency or severity 
as of december   the average cost per workers compensation claim was  which was a increase over the claims severity from of  in  claims frequency number of claims per million of payroll increased to 
from  an increase of  for the period between and in the event of a increase in claims frequency as measured by payroll  which we believe is the most important assumption regarding our business  the company s loss reserves as of december  would be understated by million and would result in an after tax reduction in shareholders equity of million 

table of contents in the event of a increase in claim severity  which is the average incurred loss per claim  the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be understated by million and would result in an after tax reduction in shareholders equity of million 
on a quarterly basis  and in some cases more frequently  we review our reserves to determine whether they are consistent with our actual results 
in the event of a discrepancy  we would seek to determine the causes underwriting  claims  inflation  regulatory and would adjust our reserves accordingly 
for example  if the development of our total incurred losses were greater than the loss development factors would have predicted  we would adjust our reserves for the periods in question 
in  we recognized a million deficiency in the prior year s reserves 
in  we recognized a million deficiency in prior year s reserves  related to our mandatory participation in the reinsurance pools which reinsure state assigned risk plans for workers compensation insurance 
in  we recognized a million redundancy 
we do not anticipate that we will make any material reserve adjustments  but will continue to monitor the accuracy of our loss development factors and adequacy of our reserves 
additional information regarding our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses can be found in risk factors and business loss reserves 
reinsurance 
reinsurance premiums  losses and lae are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums earned and losses incurred ceded to other companies have been recorded as a reduction of premium revenue and losses and lae 
commissions allowed by resinsurers on business ceded have been accounted for as ceding commission revenue 
reinsurance recoverables are reported relating to the portion of reserves and paid losses and lae that are ceded to other companies 
the company remains contingently liable for all loss payments  in the event of failure to collect from the reinsurer 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
we defer commission expenses  premium taxes and assessments as well as certain marketing  sales  underwriting and safety costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance policies 
these acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense ratably as premiums are earned 
the company may realize deferred policy acquisition costs only if the ratio of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves calculated on a discounted basis to the premiums to be earned is less than  as it historically has been 
if  hypothetically  that ratio were to be above  the company could not continue to record deferred policy acquisition costs as an asset and may be required to establish a liability for a premium deficiency reserve 
assessments related to insurance premiums 
we are subject to various assessments and premium surcharges related to our insurance activities  including assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds and second injury funds 
assessments based on premiums are generally paid within one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written 
assessments based on losses are generally paid within one year of when claims are paid by us 
state guaranty fund assessments are used by state insurance oversight agencies to pay claims of policyholders of impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies and the operating expenses of those agencies 
second injury funds are used by states to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
in some states  these assessments and premium surcharges may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes 
earned but unbilled premium 
earned but unbilled premium ebub estimates the amount of audit premium for those policies that have yet to be audited as of the date of the quarter or year end 
workers compensation policies are subject to audit and the final premium may increase or decrease materially from the original premium due to revisions to actual payroll and or employee classification 
as prescribed by the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises  paragraphs and as well as statement of statutory accounting principles ssap  the company determines ebub using statistically supported aggregate calculations based on the company s historical premium audit results 
the company has not had a material adjustment as a result of actual premium audits materially differing from the estimates used in calculating ebub 
as of december   if the actual results of the future premiums audits were lower than the historical results used in calculating ebub  the result would be a decrease in ebub and net earned premium of million or million after tax 
if the actual results of the future premiums audits were higher 
table of contents than the historical results used in calculating ebub  the result would be an increase in ebub  and net earned premium of million or million after tax 
in calculating ebub  the company considers its ability to collect the projected increased premium as well as those expenses associated with both the additional premium and return premium 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are presented at cost  which approximates fair value 
the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
the company maintains its cash balances at several financial institutions 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic secures accounts up to  at these institutions 
management monitors balances in excess of insured limits and believes they do not represent a significant credit risk to the company 
investments 
the company accounts for its investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  which requires that fixed maturity and equity securities that have readily determined fair values be segregated into categories based upon the company s intention for those securities 
in accordance with sfas  the company has classified certain of its fixed maturity securities and certain of its fixed maturities and equity securities as available for sale 
the company may sell its available for sale securities in response to changes in interest rates  risk reward characteristics  liquidity needs or other factors 
fixed maturity securities and equity securities are reported at their estimated fair values based on quoted market prices or a recognized pricing service  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax effects  reported as a separate component of comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
in accordance with fsp fas  other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  the company s investment committee committee evaluates each security which has an unrealized loss as of the end of the subject reporting period for other than temporary impairment 
the committee uses a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
some of the criteria we consider include how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  our intent and ability to keep the security for a sufficient time period for it to recover its value  any reduction or elimination of dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled interest payments  and the occurrence of discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy law 
other than temporary impairment otti losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
during and  the company recorded impairment write downs of million and million  respectively after determining that certain of its investments were otti 
during  the company did not record any otti 
goodwill and intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas  business combinations 
a purchase price paid that is in excess of net assets goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as an asset  and is not amortized 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the goodwill or intangible asset is impaired  it is written down to its realizable value with a corresponding expense reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents income taxes the company joins its domestic subsidiaries in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return and is party to a federal income tax allocation agreement 
under the tax sharing agreement  the company pays to or receives from its subsidiaries the amount  if any  by which the group s federal income tax liability was affected by virtue of inclusion of the subsidiary in the consolidated federal return 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
the deferred tax asset primarily consists of the book versus tax differences for premiums earned  loss and loss adjustment expense reserve discounting  policy acquisition costs  earned but unbilled premiums  and unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities 
changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income  primarily unrealized investment gains and losses and foreign currency translation gains and losses  are recorded directly to other comprehensive income 
otherwise  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense 
in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized

the committee uses a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
some of the criteria we consider include how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  our intent and ability to keep the security for a sufficient time period for it to recover its value  any downgrades of the security by a rating agency as well as an entire industry sector or sub sector  any reduction or elimination of dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled interest payments  and the occurrence of discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy law 
during  based on the criteria above  we determined that equity securities and two fixed income securities were other than temporarily impaired and accordingly wrote them down resulting in a million realized loss 
in addition to non cash write downs of million the company took for the impaired equity securities during  at december   the company had million of gross unrealized losses related to marketable equity securities 
the company s investment in marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock across a wide range of sectors 
the company evaluated the near term prospects for recovery of fair value in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment and has determined in each case that the probability of recovery is reasonable 
within the company s portfolio of common stocks  equity securities comprised million  or of the unrealized loss 
securities in the consumer products sector 
table of contents represent approximately of the total fair value and of the company s unrealized loss 
securities in the financial sector represent approximately of the total fair value and of the company s total unrealized losses and common stocks in the health care  industrial and technology sectors which have fair values of approximately  and  respectively  and approximately  and  respectively  of the company s unrealized losses 
additionally  the company owns stocks in other sectors which accounts for of the company s unrealized losses 
the duration of these impairments range from to months 
the remaining securities in a loss position are not considered individually significant and accounted for of the company s unrealized losses 
the company believes these securities will recover and that we have the ability and intent to hold them until recovery 
in addition to non cash write downs of million the company took for impaired fixed income securities during  the company had million of gross unrealized losses related to available for sale fixed income securities as of december  corporate bonds represent of the fair value of our fixed maturities and of the total unrealized losses of our fixed maturities 
the company owns corporate bonds in the industrial  bank and financial and other sectors  which have a fair value of approximately  and  respectively  and  and of total unrealized losses  respectively  of our fixed maturities 
the company believes that the unrealized losses in these securities are the result  primarily  of general economic conditions and not the condition of the issuers  which we believe are solvent and have the ability to meet their obligations 
therefore  the company expects that the market price for these securities should recover within a reasonable time 
based on the company s ability and intent to hold these investments for a sufficient time for recovery of fair value  the company does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed maturity and equity securities as of december

should circumstances arise that would require us to do so  we may incur losses on such sales  which would adversely affect our results of operations and could reduce investment income in future periods 
if as the result of such sales we could no longer classify any portion of our fixed maturity portfolio as held to maturity we would be required to carry all of our fixed maturity securities at the market value 
if the aggregate market value at the given balance sheet is below the aggregate amortized cost we would have a reduction to stockholders equity 
at december  our held to maturity fixed maturity portfolio had an aggregate unrealized gain of million 
if at december  we could not classify our fixed maturity portfolio as held to maturity our stockholders equity would be increased on an after tax basis by approximately million 
the use of reinsurance is an important component of our business strategy 
see business reinsurance 
as losses are incurred and recorded  we record amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers for the portion of the paid loss and loss adjustment expense as well as outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserve and ibnr that is ceded to third party reinsurers 
we purchase excess of loss workers compensation reinsurance to protect us from the impact of large losses 
under this reinsurance program  we pay our reinsurers a percentage of our net or gross earned insurance premiums  subject to certain minimum reinsurance premium requirements 
our workers compensation reinsurance programs for and includes multiple reinsurers in five layers of reinsurance that provide 
table of contents us with coverage in excess of a certain specified amount per loss occurrence  or retention level 
our workers compensation reinsurance program for and provides coverage for claims in excess of million per occurrence with coverage up to million per occurrence  subject to certain exclusions and restrictions  including a million aggregate deductible applicable to the first layer of this reinsurance coverage 
our reinsurance for workers compensation losses caused by acts of terrorism is more limited than our reinsurance for other types of workers compensation losses 
we have obtained reinsurance for this line of business with higher limits as our exposures have increased 
as the scale of our workers compensation business has increased  we have also increased the amount of risk we retain 
the company has coverage for its casualty lines of business under excess of loss reinsurance agreements

since january   we have maintained quota share reinsurance for our extended warranty and accidental damage insurance underwritten in the european union and certain coverage plans underwritten in the united states 
this reinsurance also covers certain other risks we underwrite in the european union 
under these quota share reinsurance arrangements  we cede a portion for the majority of the risks of each reinsured risk to our reinsurers and recover the same percentage of ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses  subject to certain exclusions and restrictions 
in return for this reinsurance protection  we pay the reinsurers their pro rata shares of the insurance premiums on the ceded business  less a ceding or overriding commission 
for the most part  coverage for losses arising out of acts of terrorism is excluded from this reinsurance 
the majority of our extended warranty and accidental damage insurance underwritten in the united states is not reinsured with third party reinsurers 
the following table summarizes the ten reinsurers that account for approximately of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december

the loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period in the table above are based upon the loss and loss adjustment expense estimates as of december  and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns and are not contractual liabilities as to a time certain 
our contractual liability is to provide benefits under the policy 
as a result  our calculation of loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of loss and loss adjustment expenses generally and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our loss and loss adjustment expense estimate process  see business loss reserves 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the table above to the extent that current estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
see risk factors risks related to our business our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we are subject to various annual assessments imposed by certain of the states in which we write insurance policies 
these assessments are generally based upon the amount of premiums written or losses paid during the applicable year 
assessments based on premiums are generally paid within one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written  while assessments based on losses are generally paid within one year after the loss is paid 
when we establish a reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses for a reported claim  we accrue our obligation to pay any applicable assessments 
if settlement of the claim is to be paid out over more than one year  our obligation to pay any related loss based assessments extends for the same period of time 
because our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates  our accruals for loss based insurance assessments are also based on estimates 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ  perhaps materially  from our reserves 
accordingly  our actual loss based insurance assessments may vary  perhaps materially  from our accruals 
we are required by the terms of certain purchase agreements to pay the seller an annual minimum override payment based on a contractually defined formula 
the amount payable to the seller under these agreements could be materially higher if the premiums produced generate a higher payment than the 
table of contents calculated minimum payment 
additionally  the company is holding approximately million of the purchase price  which will be distributed upon resolution of a pending tax matter 
the interest related to the debt by period is as follows million less than year  million years  million years and million more than years 
in addition included within debt and interest is million of debt related to the maiden collateral loan and million of associated interest 
inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before we know the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts 
we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves  especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation 
inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated  which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including salaries and benefits  generally are impacted by inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are liquidity risk  credit risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and equity price risk 
liquidity risk 
liquidity risk represents the potential inability of the company to meet all payment obligations when they become due 
the company maintains sufficient cash and marketable securities to fund claim payments and operations 
we purchase reinsurance coverage to mitigate the risk of an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency from catastrophic events or a single large loss 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly 
credit risk 
credit risk is the potential loss arising principally from adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuers of our fixed maturity securities and the financial condition of our third party reinsurers 
we address the credit risk related to the issuers of our fixed maturity securities by investing primarily in fixed maturity securities that are rated bbb or higher by standard poor s 
we also independently monitor the financial condition of all issuers of our fixed maturity securities 
to limit our risk exposure  we employ diversification policies that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to our third party reinsurers 
although our third party reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us to the extent we cede risk to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have ceded 
as a result  reinsurance contracts do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims covered under the insurance policies we issue and we might not collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers 
we address this credit risk by selecting reinsurers which have an am best rating of a excellent or better at the time we enter into the agreement and by performing  along with our reinsurance broker  periodic credit reviews of our reinsurers 
if one of our reinsurers suffers a credit downgrade  we may consider various options to lessen the risk of asset impairment  including commutation  novation and letters of credit 
see reinsurance 
interest rate risk 
we had fixed maturity securities excluding million of time and short term deposits with a fair value of million and a carrying value of million as of december  that are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of our fixed maturity securities 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset and liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position 
the table below summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our fixed maturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities as of december  
table of contents to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  and the associated impact on our stockholders equity 
because we anticipate that the company will continue to meet its obligations out of income  we classify a portion of our fixed maturity securities  other than redeemable preferred stock  mortgage backed and corporate obligations  as held to maturity and carry them on our balance sheet at cost or amortized cost  as applicable 
any redeemable preferred stock we hold from time to time is classified as available for sale and carried on our balance sheet at fair value 
temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities that are held to maturity  such as those resulting from interest rate fluctuations  do not impact the carrying value of these securities and  therefore  do not affect our shareholders equity 
however  temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities that are held as available for sale do impact the carrying value of these securities and are reported in our shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events  but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities and on our shareholders equity  each as of december

a fluctuation of basis points in interest on our variable rate debt instruments  which are tied to libor  would affect our earnings and cash flows by million before income tax  on an annual basis  but would not affect the fair market value of the variable rate debt 
foreign currency risk 
we write insurance in the united kingdom and certain other european union member countries through aiu 
while the functional currency of aiu is the euro  we write coverages that are settled in local currencies  including the british pound 
we attempt to maintain sufficient local currency assets on deposit to minimize our exposure to realized currency losses 
assuming a increase in the exchange rate of the local currency in which the claims will be paid and that we do not hold that local currency  we would recognize a million before tax realized currency loss based on our outstanding foreign denominated reserves of million at december  equity price risk 
equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio  which include common stocks  non redeemable preferred stocks and master limited partnerships 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  adverse changes in the market prices of our equity securities result in a decrease in the value of our total assets and a decrease in our shareholders equity 
as of december   the equity securities in our investment portfolio had a fair value of million  representing approximately two percent of our total invested assets on that date 
we are fundamental long buyers and short sellers  with a focus on value oriented stocks 
the table below illustrates the impact on our equity portfolio and financial position given a hypothetical movement in the broader equity markets 
the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events  but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the carrying value of our equity portfolio and on shareholders equity as of december  the hypothetical scenarios below assume that the company s beta is when compared to the s p index
