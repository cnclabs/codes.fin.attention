questar e p net production from the pinedale anticline in western wyoming grew to bcfe in as a result of ongoing development drilling 
historically  pinedale seasonal access restrictions imposed by the bureau of land management have limited the ability to drill and complete wells during the mid november to early may period 
in september  the blm issued a record of decision rod on the final supplemental environmental impact statement for long term development of natural gas resources in the pinedale anticline project area papa 
under the rod  questar e p and wexpro will be allowed to drill and complete wells year round in one of the five concentrated development areas defined in the papa 
the rod contains additional requirements and restrictions on development of the papa 
in the uinta basin  questar e p s net production grew to bcfe in production volumes were adversely impacted by connection of new  deep  high pressure wells to the existing gathering infrastructure 
connection of the new deep wells resulted in high gathering system pressure that negatively impacted production from existing shallower and lower pressure wasatch mesaverde wells 
gathering infrastructure improvements are underway to address the situation  but right of way permitting issues could delay installation until mid rockies legacy net production in grew to bcfe  bcfe higher than the year ago period 
increased production volumes were driven by new wells and the acquisition of additional interests in the wamsutter area of the green river basin in wyoming  and increased production from outside operated oil wells in the williston basin in north dakota 
questar e p rockies legacy properties include all rocky mountain region properties except the pinedale anticline and the uinta basin 
net production in the midcontinent grew to bcfe in  bcfe higher than midcontinent production growth was driven by the first quarter acquisition of new natural gas development properties in northwest louisiana  ongoing infill development drilling in the elm grove field in northwest louisiana  continued development of the granite wash atoka morrow play in the texas panhandle  and production from new outside operated woodford shale horizontal gas wells in the anadarko basin in central oklahoma

the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
gas and oil reserves gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  production history  and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and other taxes  capital expenditures and remediation costs 
the subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
for  revisions of reserve estimates  other than revisions related to pinedale increased density  resulted in a bcfe decrease in questar e p s proved reserves and a bcfe decrease in cost of service proved reserves 
revisions associated with pinedale increased density drilling added bcfe to questar e p s estimated prov ed reserves at december   and bcfe of additional cost of service proved reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report for more information on the company s estimated proved reserves 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions  exploration  development and production activities 
under this method  the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties  successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed 
costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties 
individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment 
capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned 
capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves 
the calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement  surface restoration and property abandonment costs  net of estimated equipment salvage values 
other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants 
a gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned  or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected 
questar e p engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available 
long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis 
impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the evaluated asset is less than the asset s carrying value 
the asset value is written down to estimated fair value  which is determined using discounted future net cash flows 
questar form k accounting for derivative contracts the company uses derivative contracts  typically fixed price swaps  to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production 
accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date 
the change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives 
the company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in sfas as amended 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
when a derivative is terminated before its contract expires  the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered 
questar e p uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas  oil and ngl sold to purchasers 
revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity price indexes and volumes supplied by field operators 
a liability is recorded to the extent that questar e p has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property 
energy trading presents revenues on a gross revenue basis 
energy trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions  nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices 
questar gas estimates revenues on a calendar basis even though bills are sent to customers on a cycle basis throughout the month 
the company estimates unbilled revenues for the period from the date meters are read to the end of the month  using usage history and weather information 
approximately one half month of revenues is estimated in any period 
the gas costs and other variable costs are recorded on the same basis to ensure proper matching of revenues and expenses 
questar gas tariff provides for monthly adjustments to customer bills to approximate the impact of normal temperatures on non gas revenues 
questar gas estimates the weather normalization adjustment for the unbilled revenue each month 
the weather normalization adjustment is evaluated each month and reconciled on an annual basis in the summer to agree with the amount billed to customers 
in  the pscu approved a pilot program for a conservation enabling tariff effective january   to promote energy conservation 
under the cet  questar gas non gas revenues are decoupled from the volume of gas used by customers 
the tariff specifies a margin per customer for each month with differences to be deferred and recovered from customers or refunded to customers through periodic rate adjustments 
these adjustments are limited to five percent of non gas revenues 
rate regulation regulatory agencies establish rates for the storage  transportation  distribution and sale of natural gas 
the regulatory agencies also regulate  among other things  the extension and enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional natural gas facilities 
regulation is intended to permit the recovery  through rates  of the cost of service  including a return on investment 
questar gas and questar pipeline follow sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  that requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities by companies subject to cost based regulation 
the ferc  pscu and pscw have accepted the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities 
employee benefit plans the company has defined benefit pension and life insurance plans covering a majority of its employees and a postretirement medical plan providing coverage to less than half of its employees 
the calculation of the company s expense and liability associated with its benefit plans requires the use of assumptions that the company deems to be critical 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expenses and liabilities and actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
independent consultants hired by the company use actuarial models to calculate estimates of pension and postretirement benefits expense 
the models use key factors such as mortality estimations  liability discount rates  long term rates of return on investments  rates of compensation increases  amortized gain or loss from investments and medical cost trend rates 
management formulates assumptions based on market indicators and advice from consultants 
the company believes that the liability discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on benefit plan assets are critical assumptions 
the assumed liability discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled 
management considers the rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments and compares those results with a bond defeasance technique 
the company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of as of december  and a decrease in the discount rate would increase the company s estimated annual pension expense by about million 
the expected long term rate of return on benefit plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested for purposes of paying pension benefits 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year giving consideration to the benefit plan s investment mix and historical and forecasted rates of questar form k return on these types of securities 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company was as of january  and benefit plan expense typically increases as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets decreases 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return causes an approximate million increase in the qualified pension expense
