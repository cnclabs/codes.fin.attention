table of contents recent trends and developments pharmaceutical systems the majority of our sales growth in recent years has been generated by the performance of pharmaceutical systems 
growth in was adversely affected by isolated regulatory and insurance reimbursement changes that decreased the demand for certain biotechnology customers products  our decision to cease production of a low margin disposable medical product component  and customer inventory management initiatives in response to the recent global economic turmoil 
despite these issues  we were successful in replacing the lost sales and growing business through increased demand in certain global markets  resulting in sales of million  an increase of over the prior year 
pharmaceutical packaging components that include our post manufacturing value added processes  including westar washing and flurotec and b coatings  continued to lead the demand for our products 
gross profit increased during the year to million  although the gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to the lost sales issues described above and the increased raw material and energy costs experienced during the year 
tech group our tech group segment had a challenging year in as it was forced to respond to the loss of revenues associated with the exubera inhalation device 
in october  pfizer inc discontinued marketing exubera  a pulmonary insulin product developed by our customer nektar therapeutics nektar and licensed to pfizer 
in addition to the lost business associated with exubera  tech group experienced decreased demand for an over the counter healthcare packaging product following a significant market launch 
at the same time  we experienced stronger than expected demand for several other healthcare devices and consumer products 
tech group net sales were million  lower than the prior year  including the impact of lost exubera device sales of million 
despite the drop in net sales  operating profit increased million  or over  as a result of gains in production efficiency and savings from restructuring and cost cutting activities 
in december  we announced a restructuring plan for our tech group which proactively addressed anticipated changes in customers marketing plans for certain products and aligned our plant capacity and workforce with the business outlook and longer term strategy of focusing the business on proprietary products 
as part of this plan  we implemented a series of restructuring initiatives during to reduce production and engineering operations  reduce administrative costs  and consolidate our tool shops into one location 
during and  we incurred restructuring costs totaling million in each year  and we will incur additional costs  not expected to exceed million  during the first half of as we complete this program 
in the aggregate  expected costs of this program consist of million in severance and benefits for approximately employees  million in asset related charges  and million for contract termination fees and other expenses 
estimated cost savings were approximately million for and are expected to be approximately to million annually thereafter 
business outlook management s operating priorities in will include a focus on generating organic growth  improving operating margins and continuing to invest in the future 
now that the tech group restructuring is substantially completed and we have implemented other cost reduction efforts throughout the organization  we expect to realize incremental operating cost savings in we will continue to aggressively manage the costs under our control  and take advantage of targeted restructuring activities where necessary 
our business outlook remains positive for both segments  however  we expect that sales growth will be hampered by the current global economic conditions 

table of contents pharmaceutical systems our revenue projections reflect the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro and certain other international currencies during the fourth quarter of after taking into account an anticipated unfavorable foreign exchange impact of  we expect full year revenues for pharmaceutical systems to be marginally lower than those achieved in growth  excluding the impact of currency  is expected to continue to be driven by demand for our enhanced product offerings including westar and advanced coated products  prefillable syringe components  and safety and administration systems 
we believe that the long term drivers remain strong and market dynamics support future growth with an aging population  advances in treatments for chronic illnesses  many of which involve biologic drugs  and a shift in the point of care from hospitals to specialty clinics and homes 
given our positive growth outlook  we plan to continue funding the capital projects necessary to meet customer demand and to provide for improved results in our longer term strategic plan 
during  we made significant strides in increasing our plant capacity in germany  serbia  france  singapore and the us we are also in the process of constructing a new facility in china  which will manufacture plastic components for disposable medical products  and we continue to evaluate opportunities for constructing rubber manufacturing facilities in china and india 
we expect our capital spending to be approximately equal to the level  which will allow us to complete the ongoing expansion projects  fund innovation for promising new products  replace certain manufacturing and accounting information systems  and maintain our existing facilities 
tech group we expect full year revenues to be lower than those in by to  after taking into account an expected unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately and lower plastic resin costs which are passed through to the majority of our contract customers in the form of selling price adjustments 
excluding the negative impact of these two items  growth is expected to come from demand in healthcare devices and several new consumer product launches planned by our customers 
although tech group is projecting lower sales for  we believe that the combination of a leaner cost structure  made possible by restructuring initiatives  and increased operating efficiency at our production facilities will provide for a consistent level of operating profit 
on a longer term basis  we believe that the tech group segment will benefit from our innovation initiatives in developing proprietary products incorporating new technologies and advanced injection systems 
with the expansion of our grand rapids  michigan plant now completed  the majority of our capital spending within the tech group will be focused on the support of new products and routine facility and equipment upgrades 
research development r d and innovation we expect r d spending to surpass levels by approximately as we continue to invest in advanced injectable packaging and delivery systems and safety and reconstitution products 
we anticipate that a majority of our developmental medical devices will be manufactured by our tech group and marketed by pharmaceutical systems 
we believe that our commitment to develop and apply proprietary technologies that improve the quality  safety and effectiveness of therapeutic and diagnostic healthcare delivery systems will result in continued long term growth 

table of contents global economic conditions current economic conditions in the us and abroad are expected to have a moderate impact on the sales growth of our products  as customers search for ways to cut costs including rationalization of their inventories 
in addition  we anticipate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have an unfavorable impact on consolidated sales of approximately in after considering the unfavorable foreign currency impact  we expect consolidated sales to be between billion and billion  a reduction of to compared with those of excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency translation  sales are expected to grow between and 
our financial projections for were prepared using a forecast of foreign currency exchange rates for our various non us subsidiaries 
as such  continued volatility in key exchange rates during may result in significant differences in us dollar results  affecting the accuracy of our sales and earnings projections 
in addition to the impact on sales  the slowing economy and adverse conditions in equity and debt markets contributed to a decline in the value of our us pension assets  compared to a long term rate of return assumption of 
as a result of this and other changes in pension assumptions  we are expecting an incremental pension expense of approximately million in continued actual returns below our expected rate may also affect the amount and timing of future contributions to the plan 
we have no erisa employee retirement income security act funding requirements in  however  we have made a voluntary pension contribution of million in january the global reach of our business and the nature of our product portfolio that serves primarily non discretionary pharmaceutical and medical applications are expected to limit the impact of temporary economic downturns 
however  the world financial markets have recently experienced extreme disruption and global economic conditions have worsened 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the ongoing economic downturn will not have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products

net sales the following table summarizes net sales by reportable segment year ended december  change in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group intersegment sales total net sales 
table of contents compared to consolidated net sales increased by million  or  over those achieved in the prior year 
favorable foreign currency translation accounted for the vast majority of the consolidated sales growth 
sales price increases contributed percentage points to sales growth  as price increases including raw material surcharges were implemented in response to rising raw material and energy costs during the year 
substantially offsetting the impact of sales price increases were lower volumes and unfavorable mix resulting from regulatory and insurance reimbursement related constraints and the discontinuation of certain products  which resulted in lost sales within both reporting segments 
pharmaceutical systems this segment contributed million to the full year sales increase  including million resulting from favorable foreign currency translation 
excluding currency translation effects  sales were million  or  above prior year levels 
price increases contributed approximately percentage points of the sales increase over the prior year 
favorable sales volume and mix contributed percentage point  despite the loss of the discrete pharmaceutical packaging and disposable medical components sales described below 
sales of pharmaceutical packaging components were million higher than the prior year due to increased sales of stoppers and seals used in a variety of customer products as well as favorable currency translation 
these increases more than compensated for a million decline in sales of a prefillable syringe component caused by regulatory and insurance reimbursement changes affecting the demand for certain customer products designed to treat anemia in cancer and other patients 
sales of disposable medical components were million lower  as sales of other syringe components replaced a portion of the million of sales of a low margin blood collection system component that we ceased producing 
sales of safety and administration systems  and laboratory and other services were million higher than the prior year  most of which was due to increased demand for our drug reconstitution products and higher tooling activity 
tech group full year sales were million below levels  including million of favorable foreign currency translation 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  sales were million  or  below prior year levels 
price increases contributed percentage points to sales  while increased consumer products sales volume offset a small portion of the lost exubera device business 
sales of healthcare devices decreased million compared with the prior year 
after considering the lost exubera sales of million  we experienced increased sales volume of other healthcare devices including medical filter products  self injection pens  and intra nasal drug delivery systems  partially offset by a drop off in sales of packaging for a customer s over the counter weight loss product following a june market launch 
sales of consumer products  tooling and other services decreased by million due to lower demand for certain personal care products and tooling services  partially offset by increased volume of juice and dairy carton closures 
intersegment sales of million and million in and  respectively  were eliminated in consolidation 
compared to consolidated net sales increased by million  or  over those achieved in foreign currency translation accounted for million  or percentage points  of the sales growth 
excluding foreign currency translation  net sales increased million or over the prior year 
pharmaceutical systems the pharmaceutical systems segment contributed million of the full year sales increase  including million resulting from favorable foreign currency translation 
excluding foreign currency translation  pharmaceutical systems sales were million  or  above prior year levels 
price increases contributed approximately percentage points of the sales increase over the prior year  with the remainder of the increase attributed to positive sales volume 
sales growth was strong in all geographical regions of the segment  driven by increased demand for serum stoppers used in vial packaging for vaccines  injectable treatments for chronic diseases  and increased demand for pre filled injection system components 

table of contents tech group full year sales in were million above prior year levels  million of which resulted from foreign currency translation 
excluding foreign currency translation  tech group segment sales were million  or  above prior year levels 
price increases contributed approximately percentage points of the sales increase in the tech group  with the remainder of the increase attributed to positive sales volume 
the tech group sales increase included a million increase in sales to nektar of the exubera device resulting from the timing of the product launch by pfizer in the us earlier in the year 
tech group sales also benefited from strong sales of weight loss product packaging  an intra nasal delivery system and surgery devices  but these were largely offset by a million decline in revenue from tooling and design projects 
intersegment sales of million and million in and  respectively  were eliminated in consolidation 
gross profit the following table summarizes our gross profit and related gross margins by reportable segment year ended december  change in millions pharmaceutical systems gross profit gross margin tech group gross profit gross margin consolidated gross profit consolidated gross margin compared to consolidated gross profit increased by million over  including the favorable effect from foreign currency translation of million 
the gross margin percentage improved slightly despite the unfavorable impact on sales volume and mix caused by the loss of discrete business described in the net sales section above 
pharmaceutical systems gross margin for pharmaceutical systems declined by one percentage point versus the prior year 
approximately half of this decrease was due to unfavorable volume and mix resulting from the regulatory and insurance reimbursement issues affecting the demand for prefillable syringe components used in certain anemia products 
the remaining decline resulted from increased depreciation expense and production cost increases  as the positive benefit of sales price increases offset a majority of the increased costs of raw materials  wage increases and utilities used to operate our production facilities 
tech group gross margins improved by percentage points in comparison to prior year results 
the improved gross margin performance was largely due to a significant reduction in plant overhead and improved production efficiency which contributed percentage points 
these gains resulted from our restructuring efforts and efficiencies from the completion of start up activities at our expanded production facility in michigan 
partially offsetting these increases by percentage points was the impact of lower sales and unfavorable mix 
despite sales increases in consumer products and other healthcare devices  the loss of business associated with the exubera device and the prior year weight loss product launch resulted in a decline in sales and negative impact on gross margin 
during the year  the majority of raw material  energy and wage cost increases were passed on to customers in the form of increased selling prices 
compared to consolidated gross profit increased by million over  consisting of a million increase in pharmaceutical systems segment gross profit and a million decrease in tech group segment gross profit 
foreign currency translation accounted for million of the increase in consolidated gross profit 

table of contents pharmaceutical systems the gross margin within the pharmaceutical systems segment declined moderately compared to that achieved in  primarily due to higher plant overhead costs including the addition of engineering and other staff in support of our expansion projects  increased manufacturing  supply and maintenance costs resulting from strained capacity levels at several facilities in europe  and higher depreciation charges on machinery and equipment upgrades 
tech group the tech group segment gross profit and gross margin declines primarily reflect million of incremental costs associated with the relocation and start up of our new facility in michigan 
research and development r d costs the following table summarizes r d costs by reportable segment in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group total r d costs r d costs during were million higher than those incurred in  mostly due to three ongoing development projects in the pharmaceutical systems segment 
the first is our development of prefillable syringe systems that will use daikyo seiko  ltd 
daikyo crystal zenith resin  a unique  transparent polymer that can be used to produce vials and syringe barrels 
daikyo  our owned affiliate in japan  is also our partner in a long standing marketing and technology transfer agreement that enables west and daikyo to develop products that help customers mitigate drug product development risks and enhance drug performance and patient safety 
the other major projects include an advanced injection system using auto injector technology  which was acquired during  and a passive needle safety device 
the increase in over r d costs reflected the formation of our innovation group which is responsible for seeking new opportunities in injectable packaging and delivery systems 
our development projects are a response to the market opportunities created by the convergence of primary drug packaging and delivery systems and include initiatives in traditional injection systems  components for pen system applications and auto injectors with cartridges

in pharmaceutical systems  sg a expenses increased by million over the prior year 
foreign currency translation accounted for million of the increase 
compensation costs were million above those incurred in due to the impact of annual pay increases  and increased staffing of information technology support functions 
costs associated with our new information systems implementation  including depreciation expense and third party consulting fees  accounted for million of the increase 
various other increases including utilities and other corporate facilities costs contributed to the remaining increase in sg a expense 
sg a costs in the tech group were million lower than the amount incurred in a net reduction in headcount associated with our restructuring efforts accounted for half of the reduction in sg a 
the remainder of the reduction was attributable to lower amortization expense  resulting from the nektar contract intangible write off  and a reduction in various third party consulting services 
general corporate sg a costs were million favorable to levels 
these costs include executive and director compensation and other corporate administrative and facilities expenses 
the majority of the decrease is the result of lower facilities and administrative related costs 
also included in corporate sg a are any above or below target performance adjustments for our worldwide cash bonus program 
annual cash bonus payments are made based on the achievement of sales  operating profit  earnings per share and cash flow targets  and certain qualitative performance milestones 
cash based bonus costs were slightly lower than those earned in the prior year based upon management s achievement of targets 
stock based compensation costs for increased by million due to the impact of changes in our stock price on the fair value of our stock price indexed deferred compensation liabilities 
during  our stock price decreased per share  closing at per share on december   while during our stock price decreased per share  closing at per share on december  the costs of non us pension and other retirement benefits programs are reflected in the operating profit of the respective segment for all periods presented

sales commissions were million higher than in foreign currency translation  travel costs and bad debt expense contributed equally to the remaining million increase 
general corporate sg a costs were million lower in than in incentive compensation costs in were million lower than the prior year  primarily due to the achievement of above target performance levels resulting in above target bonus payouts in  compared to incentive compensation which was below target 

table of contents stock based compensation costs for decreased by million when compared to those recorded in  due primarily to a decrease in west stock price indexed compensation costs  partially offset by higher stock option and employee stock purchase plan costs 
our stock price decreased per share during  closing at per share on december  in  our stock price increased per share closing at per share at december  us pension plan expenses in were million lower than those incurred during the decrease largely resulted from a amendment to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in the us under the amended plan  benefits earned under the plan s pension formulas were frozen as of december  and replaced with new cash balance formulas resulting in a reduction of our projected benefit obligation 
restructuring  impairment and other items other income and expense items  consisting of gains  losses or impairments of segment assets  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  miscellaneous royalties and sundry transactions are generally recorded within the respective segment 
certain restructuring and other items considered outside the control of segment management are not allocated to our reporting segments 
the following table summarizes our restructuring charges and other income and expense items for each of the three years ended december in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group corporate unallocated charges credits impairment charge  contract settlement and related gain  net restructuring and related charges brazilian excise tax and other charges total unallocated charges credits total restructuring  impairment and other charges the year over year reduction in other expense for pharmaceutical systems is attributable to net foreign exchange gains on intercompany and third party transactions recognized during other expense in included a million impairment charge for productive assets and royalties stemming from a discontinued product 
after taking this charge into consideration  the amounts recognized in and are fairly consistent 
for tech group  the reduction in other expense in versus resulted from the recognition of income from government grants in europe 
the majority of tech group other expense in related to the sale or disposal of surplus equipment 
the miscellaneous charges recorded in corporate expense represent foreign exchange transaction losses 
impairment charge  contract settlement and related gain  net in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge representing our net book value in the nektar contract intangible asset associated with the exubera device 
under an agreement reached with nektar in february  we received full reimbursement for  among other things  severance related employee costs  equipment  purchased raw materials and components  leases and other facility costs associated with the shutdown of manufacturing operations related to this device 
during  we received payments from nektar which more than offset the related costs incurred  resulting in a net gain of million 
restructuring and related charges we incurred million and million in and  respectively  of restructuring and related charges as part of our plan to align the plant capacity and workforce of the tech group with the revised business outlook for that segment 
we expect to incur additional amounts  not to exceed million  during the first half of as these restructuring activities are concluded 

table of contents brazil excise tax and other charges during  we increased our accruals for a series of social  excise and other tax contingencies in brazil by million 
these charges followed a detailed review of several related tax cases pending in the brazilian courts  which indicated that it was probable that our positions taken on previous tax returns  some of which date back to the late s  would not be sustained 
this matter is currently awaiting final disposition in the brazilian court system 
operating profit operating profit loss by reportable segment  corporate and other unallocated costs was as follows in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group corporate and other unallocated costs general corporate costs stock based compensation costs us pension expenses other unallocated items consolidated operating profit compared to pharmaceutical systems operating profit was lower than prior year results by million  including a foreign currency translation benefit of million 
the impact of higher sales and gross profit was more than offset by higher spending on information systems and research and development initiatives as we replace outdated management reporting systems and invest in innovative products for the future 
tech group operating profit was million above that achieved in the prior year  including a foreign currency benefit of million  largely due to savings resulting from the restructuring program initiated in late  and production efficiencies coming from higher throughput at our newly expanded michigan facility 
general corporate costs declined as a result of lower compensation costs under our annual performance based bonus plan  and stock based compensation costs increased due to the impact of changes in our stock price on deferred compensation obligations which are indexed to our stock price 
other unallocated income for totaled million  consisting of a million restructuring charge and million in proceeds less costs of transition activities at our former exubera device production facility 
other unallocated expense for was million including a million restructuring charge  a million impairment loss on our customer contract intangible for the exubera device  and a million provision for social  excise and other tax liabilities in brazil 
compared to our consolidated operating profit decreased by million from that achieved in operating profit for included million in unallocated costs as described above 
the pharmaceutical systems segment s results exceed those of the prior year by million  benefiting from sales growth  a favorable product mix and the million impact of foreign currency translation  which combined to more than offset other cost increases 
tech group segment operating profit was million below that achieved in the prior year  largely due to costs incurred during the relocation and validation of a newly expanded production facility in michigan 
general corporate  stock based compensation and us pension plan costs were all lower than those incurred in the prior year  with the significant decrease in stock price indexed deferred compensation programs attributed to the decline in our stock price during compared to the strong increase in stock price experienced in 
table of contents loss on debt extinguishment on february  we prepaid million in senior notes carrying a interest rate and a maturity date of april  under the terms of the original note purchase agreement dated april   the prepayment of the notes entitled note holders to a make whole amount of million in order to compensate them for interest rate differentials between the yield on the notes and current market rates for the remaining term of the note 
the prepayment was financed by issuing million approximately million of new senior unsecured notes at a weighted average interest rate of  before costs 
interest expense  net the following table summarizes our net interest expense in millions interest expense capitalized interest interest income interest expense  net compared to interest expense for  before capitalized interest and interest income  was million above that recorded in the prior year 
the timing of our issuance of million in convertible debt in march and april of accounted for million of the year to date increase  as the notes were outstanding for the entire year compared to a partial year in the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and bank commitment fees accounted for another million of the increase 
the decrease in interest income is also largely due to the timing of the convertible debt issuance  as a portion of the proceeds was invested in money market accounts and a strategic cash management fund in the first half of  and then subsequently used in our stock buy back program and in our capital expansion programs 
in addition  interest income was reduced by other than temporary losses on our strategic cash management fund investment totaling million in capitalized interest increased as a result of our pharmaceutical systems capital expansion projects in europe 
compared to our net interest expense was million lower than that incurred in due largely to refinancing and investing activities and higher capitalized interest on our capital expansion projects in europe and in michigan 
during  we issued million of convertible debt at a fixed interest rate 
interest expense on the convertible notes totaled million for the year ended december  the incremental interest expense from the convertible notes was partially offset in the comparison of the and periods by favorable rate and volume variances totaling million and million  respectively  resulting from reduced borrowing levels on our revolving credit facility and our refinancing activities 
our interest income is million favorable to that recorded in the additional interest income was generated from the investment of a substantial portion of the proceeds from our convertible debt offering 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in  in and in the following factors impacted the comparability of the tax rate in versus a agreement with the republic of singapore reduced our income tax rate in that country for a period of years  on a retroactive basis back to july  resulting in a million tax benefit 
a united kingdom tax law change effectively eliminated a portion of our capital allowance carryforwards  resulting in a million increase in our tax provision 
in  we recognized a million net tax provision benefit resulting from the expiration of open audit years in various tax jurisdictions  and million in other discrete benefits including reversals of us state valuation allowances and provision adjustments for returns filed in 
table of contents in  we recognized a million provision benefit related to tax credits originally generated and fully reserved in previous periods 
in  we recognized a million provision benefit principally resulting from the revision of tax planning strategies and the completion of related documentation supporting prior year r d credits  and a million tax benefit due to the closure of certain us federal and state tax audit years 
the impact of these items reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points in and percentage points in after considering these items  the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a change in mix of earnings to jurisdictions where we are subject to lower tax rates and an increase in r d tax benefits in the us and ireland 
in addition to the factors listed above  the following items impacted the comparability of the tax rate in versus included a net million favorable provision adjustment resulting from the closure of the us federal tax audit year 
in  we recognized a million provision benefit from a tax refund associated with the disposition of our former plastic molding facility in puerto rico 
the combined impact of these two items reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points 
after considering these items  the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a change in mix of foreign versus us earnings 
equity in net income of affiliates equity in net income from our ownership interest in daikyo in japan and our ownership interest in three companies in mexico was million  million  and million for the years  and  respectively 
our equity income was million lower than the prior year due to reduced earnings of daikyo 
the lower earnings were primarily the result of plant demolition and disposal costs  as well as incremental depreciation expense associated with a significant crystal zenith capital expansion project and higher pension costs 
the increase in equity earnings in versus came from daikyo  as their net income was million above that recorded in daikyo s sales were above prior year levels  their gross margins improved by three percentage points  and there were no unusual charges in unlike when a million charge was incurred related to a decision by daikyo to demolish an existing facility 
these favorable items were partially offset by a loss on sale of an investment security 
purchases from affiliates totaled million in  million in and million in  the majority of which relate to a distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and re sell daikyo products 
sales to affiliates were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share 
our results included a net gain on contract settlement proceeds of million  restructuring and related charges of million  and discrete income tax benefits of million 
collectively  these items totaled million pre tax million after tax  or per diluted share 

table of contents net income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share 
our results include the impact of restructuring charges  an impairment loss on our customer contract intangible asset with nektar  and our provisions for brazilian tax issues which collectively totaled million pre tax million after tax  or per diluted share 
also included in results was the recognition of discrete tax benefits totaling million  or per diluted share 
after considering the impact of these items  income from continuing operations in was slightly above the prior year amount 
net income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share 
our results included a million pre tax loss on debt extinguishment million after tax  or per diluted share and the favorable resolution of a claim for a tax refund associated with the disposition of our former plastic molding facility in puerto rico 
this resulted in the recognition in income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  consisting of a million tax benefit and related interest income  net of tax  of million 
discontinued operations our results included a million provision for claims anticipated from the divestiture of our former drug delivery business 
our income from discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share 
as a result of a favorable outcome to our claim for tax benefits relating to the sale of our former contract manufacturing and packaging business  we received a tax refund resulting in the recognition of a million tax benefit 
the settlement of this claim also resulted in pre tax interest income of million million after taxes 
we also recognized a million favorable adjustment to tax accruals associated with our former drug delivery systems segment primarily as a result of the closure of the us federal tax audit year 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table and explanations provide cash flow data from continuing operations for the years ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities our operating cash flows increased million compared to the prior year  including million in proceeds received from our contract settlement with nektar  partially offset by related cash costs of million 
our favorable cash flow from operating results and the impact of this contract settlement was reduced by the payment of income and other tax related liabilities in brazil totaling million 
operating cash flows in also reflected unusually high payments related to tax issues in brazil 
during  we paid million to escrow representing judicial deposits for the benefit of the brazil government to avoid further accretion of interest and penalties on tax related liabilities 
after considering these items  the cash flows from operating activities were slightly lower than  as increased earnings in were offset by cash outflows for changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 
cash flow from operations in decreased million versus cash flow in was reduced by the million payment to escrow for the benefit of the brazil government 
our operating cash flow in included the impact of a million make whole payment incurred as part of the extinguishment of our former senior note agreement 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities in  cash flows used in investing activities were million less  despite a million increase in capital spending and the acquisition of the remaining minority ownership of the medimop companies for million 
the majority of the year over year decrease resulted from million in redemptions from the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund  compared to million in net purchases in our investment in this enhanced money fund  which began an orderly liquidation in december  is discussed in more detail in note  fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements 
in compared to  the majority of the increase in cash flows used in investing activities resulted from increased capital spending 
capital spending in totaled million  a million increase over the prior year 
pharmaceutical systems spending was million  an increase of million over the prior year 
the increase is related to major projects to increase our manufacturing capacity  including the expansion of our rubber compounding capacity in kinston  north carolina  and ongoing plant expansion projects in europe and asia 
a portion of the total spending increase pertains to information technology as we replaced our financial reporting  cash disbursements and order to cash systems in north america 
the second phase of this project  focusing on procurement and plant operations  is currently in progress and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of tech group capital spending was million  a decrease of million compared to the prior year 
spending in was higher due to our grand rapids  michigan plant expansion project 
the remainder of the change relates to a million decrease in the balance of accrued capital spending compared to the december  balance 
capital spending in totaled million  a million increase over pharmaceutical systems added million in capital  compared to million in the increase was largely due to significant projects to expand the molding  production and tooling capacity at our existing facilities in europe and singapore 
our capital spending also included million in connection with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in china  and million for information system projects in north america 
tech group capital spending was million  compared to million in during  we completed our plant relocation and expansion project in michigan 
other investing cash flows included an acquisition of patents and other technology related assets totaling million 
cash flows from financing activities in  the majority of the year over year decrease in cash flows from financing activities resulted from the issuance of long term debt  partially offset by stock repurchase activity 
cash flows used in financing activities for included million in net repayment of borrowings under our revolving debt facility and million in new issuances of short term notes payable 
we paid cash dividends totaling million per share during the current year  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
we expect to continue our quarterly dividend program  subject to annual board of directors approval 
cash flows provided by financing activities for included the issuance of million of convertible junior subordinated debentures carrying a coupon rate and due in march of  resulting in net cash proceeds of million  after payment of underwriting and other costs of million 
these net proceeds provided funds used in the reduction of revolving credit facility borrowings totaling million 
during  we initiated and completed an open market repurchase program under which we acquired  shares of common stock at total cost of million per share 

table of contents liquidity measures the table below displays key liquidity measures for west as of december in millions cash and cash equivalents working capital current ratio to to to total debt net debt to total invested capital short term investments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents 
working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities 
net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents  and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt  minority interests and shareholders equity 
the majority of the change in key liquidity measures in compared to resulted from the issuance of convertible debt  net of our share buyback activity in that year 
included in other current assets and working capital at december  and december  were million and million  respectively  held in escrow representing judicial deposits to the government of brazil 
the liability associated with these tax exposures was recorded in taxes other than income on the consolidated balance sheets and was also reflected as a component of working capital in the table above 
based on our business outlook and our capital structure at the close of  we believe that we have ample liquidity to fund our business needs  new product development  capital expansion  pension and other post retirement benefits and to pay dividends 
our capital spending budget is set at approximately million  a portion of which could be reduced at our discretion if global economic conditions worsen or our market outlook changes drastically 
we expect that our cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be met primarily through our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand  and amounts available under our million multi currency unsecured committed revolving credit agreement  which we generally use for working capital requirements 
as of december   we had available million of borrowing capacity under this facility  and we have not experienced any limit on our ability to access this source of funds 
this facility expires in  and market conditions at that time could affect the cost and terms of the replacement facility  as well as terms of other debt instruments we enter into from time to time 
current market conditions current global economic conditions and instability in the financial markets have increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and default risks of our vendors  suppliers and other counterparties with which we conduct business 
we expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in obtaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials 
we periodically monitor our customers and key vendors financial condition and assess their liquidity in order to mitigate our counterparty risks 
if our key suppliers are unable to provide raw materials needed for our products  we may be unable to fulfill sales orders in a timely manner due to the rigorous qualification process 
to date  we have not experienced any significant increase in customer collectibility risks  nor have we experienced increased supply risks due to vendor insolvency 
we do not expect that recent global credit market conditions will have a significant impact on our liquidity  however  the world financial markets have recently experienced extreme disruption 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the ongoing economic downturn will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or capital resources 

table of contents commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december  these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 
payments due by period in millions less than year to years to years more than years total purchase obligations notes payable and long term debt interest on long term debt and interest rate swaps operating lease obligations pensions other post retirement obligations total contractual obligations for fixed rate long term debt  interest was based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at year end 
future interest payments on variable rate debt were calculated using principal amounts and the applicable ending interest rate at year end 
interest on fixed rate derivative instruments was based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at year end 
reserves for uncertain tax positions the table above does not include million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately million of associated accrued interest as of december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows  we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods and amounts which may be paid 
letters of credit we have letters of credit totaling million supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment lease payments in ireland and the payment of sales tax liabilities in the us the accrual for insurance obligations was million at december  purchase obligations our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers 
in accordance with gaap  these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 
foreign currency contracts we periodically enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce our exposure to variability in cash flows related to anticipated purchases of raw materials and other inventory denominated in non functional currencies 
we also enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate exposure of non functional currency asset and liability balances to changes in exchange rates 
as of december   these hedges resulted in a combined liability at a fair value of million  which is not reflected in the above table 
pension other post retirement obligations our objective in funding the domestic tax qualified pension plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of erisa 
our annual funding decision also takes into account the extent to which the benefit obligation exceeds its corresponding funded status 
outside of the us  our objective is to fund the retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions 
the table above reflects a voluntary contribution made in january to the us qualified pension plan of million 
the amounts and timing of future company contributions to the defined benefit and other post retirement pension plans are unknown because they are dependent on pension fund asset performance  as well as other factors 
the non qualified defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans are generally not funded in advance 

table of contents off balance sheet agreements at december   the company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees as noted above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions  some of which are subjective and complex  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from our product manufacturing operations which convert rubber  metal  and plastic raw materials into parts used in closure systems and syringe components for use with injectable drugs and drug delivery devices 
sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes 
management records rebate costs when the sales occur based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained 
we also establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
impairment of long lived assets we review goodwill and other long lived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs 
our reporting units are the same as our operating segments  which we have determined to be the americas and europe asia pacific divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment and the americas and europe divisions of the tech group segment 
for assets held and used in the business  management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit 
when assets are held for sale  management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset  less disposition costs 
changes in the estimate of fair value  including the estimate of future cash flows  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
employee benefits the measurement of the annual cost and obligations under our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans is subject to a number of assumptions 
sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as amended by sfas  requires companies to use an expected long term rate of asset return assumption for computing current year pension expense 
for us plans  which account for of global plan assets  the long term rate of return assumption was in and the prior two years 
this assumption is reviewed annually and determined by the projected return for our target mix of plan assets approximately equity and debt securities 
differences between the actual and expected returns are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as actuarial gains or losses 
sfas also requires companies to discount future obligations back to today s dollars using an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rate selected is the single rate equivalent for a theoretical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to our plans projected benefit payments 
an increase in the discount rate decreases the pension benefit obligation 
this decrease is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as an actuarial gain 
changes in key assumptions  including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
we estimate that every basis point reduction in the long term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by million  and a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by million 

table of contents the discount rate used in determining the us pension plans benefit obligation at december  increased basis points to  to reflect market conditions at that time 
as of december   pre tax actuarial losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to pension and other retirement benefits were million  including a current year actuarial loss of million  which was the result of poor investment performance 
we estimate that the impact of these actuarial losses will increase our pension expense by approximately million compared with the current year 
on december   we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas requires the recognition of an asset or liability for the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as measured by the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation 
for a pension plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for any other postretirement plan  such as a retiree health plan  the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
due to poor investment performance during  our funded status has been negatively impacted as the value of our plan assets has declined significantly 
partially offsetting this was an increase in our weighted average discount rate  which lowered our pension plan liability 
based on full year negative plan asset returns as of december  and a weighted average discount rate of  we were required to recognize a net pension underfunded balance of million compared to million at december   and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of million after tax 
our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was million and million at december  and  respectively 
income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation 
in addition  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability  generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level 
changes in tax legislation  business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments  which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 
on january   we adopted fin this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
fin prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the adoption of fin resulted in the recognition of net tax assets that met the more likely than not threshold of million and was reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  new accounting standards  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included within item of this report for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates and foreign currency rate fluctuations 
these risk factors can impact results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
from time to time  we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts 
derivatives used by us are highly effective as all of the critical terms of the derivative instruments match the hedged item 
effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with company policy  derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 
all debt securities and derivative instruments are considered non trading 
foreign currency exchange risk we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for approximately of consolidated net sales 
virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars 
although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are in the local currency of the subsidiary  they may also hold assets or liabilities not denominated in their local currency 
these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
as a result  our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing exchange rates 
we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize month end balance sheet exposures on cross currency intercompany loans 
we have entered into a series of foreign currency hedge contracts which are designed to eliminate the currency risk associated with forecasted us dollar usd denominated inventory purchases made by certain european subsidiaries 
as of december   there were eleven monthly contracts outstanding at million each  for an aggregate notional amount of million 
the fair value of these contracts at december  was million and was recorded within other current liabilities 
the last contract matures on december  the contracts effectively fix the euro to usd exchange rate for of our anticipated needs at a maximum of usd per euro while allowing us to benefit from any currency movement between and usd per euro 
as of december   the euro was equal to usd 
in addition to these contracts  we have other forward exchange contracts hedging various obligations for a fair value of million at december  we have designated our million euro denominated notes as a hedge of our investment in the net assets of our european operations 
a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of million net of tax of million on the million debt is recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  we also have a billion yen denominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our investment in a japanese affiliate

interest rate risk as a result of our normal borrowing activities  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates which we manage primarily through our financing activities 
we have long term debt with both fixed and variable interest rates 
long term debt consists of senior notes  convertible debentures  revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
portions of long term debt which are payable during are classified as short term liabilities as of december
