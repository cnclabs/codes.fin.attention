item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview makemusic s mission is to develop and market solutions that transform how music is composed  taught  learned and performed 
this is accomplished by providing integrated technology  content and web services to enhance and expand how music is taught  learned and prepared for performance 
providing music education content developers with a technology enriched publishing platform that leverages their copyrighted assets while simultaneously increasing the content and value of the smartmusic library 
offering software solutions for engraving and electronically distributing sheet music 
makemusic develops and markets two product lines  smartmusic learning software for band  jazz ensemble  orchestra and choir and finale music notation software 
we believe these innovative products that reinforce each other s features and competitiveness  will allow us to continue to achieve positive operating results 
the well established finale family of music notation software products provides a solid base business that generates cash and a large customer database 
music notation software is a niche business with limited growth since only a small percentage of musicians ever notate music 
our fiscal year resulted in continued sales growth for makemusic and overall  a increase over net revenue was achieved 
smartmusic revenue grew due to our subscription growth from  on december  to  on december  and a price increase implemented in july notation revenue declined overall  which we attribute to worldwide economic conditions 
gross margin percentages decreased slightly in to from in operating expenses increased in  primarily due to development expenses as we expanded our systems infrastructure to support our customer base and provide redundancy 
additionally  sales and marketing expenses increased as we expanded our direct sales force 
we also recorded  in costs relating to the departure of our founder and co chief executive officer in november  as a result of the factors mentioned  we reported net income of approximately  in compared to net income of  in we believe our greatest growth potential lies with smartmusic  a subscription based product directed toward the very large and constantly renewing market of music students and their teachers 
smartmusic combines a software application  a library of thousands of titles and skill development exercises  and a web service to provide students with a compelling experience and teachers with a comprehensive solution 
smartmusic software enhances and transforms the hours spent practicing by putting students inside a professional band  orchestra  or choir so that they can hear how the music is supposed to be performed and how their part fits in 
this makes practicing much more fun  causing students to practice longer and more often 
smartmusic also offers a rich variety of effective practice tools that make practice time more efficient and productive 
the combination of making practice time more fun and productive leads to rapid student skill development  increased student confidence  higher student retention  and stronger music programs 
in april  we introduced smartmusic impact  a web based grade book that is included with each teacher subscription 
we are in the process of renaming this product to smartmusic gradebook to more clearly define the capability of the product 
smartmusic gradebook is designed to manage student assignments  grades  and recordings while documenting the progress of each student and assessing student achievement 
this provides music educators and students with exciting new possibilities to assist in developing strong music programs and complying with accountability requirements 
smartmusic provides access to an ever increasing library of band  jazz ensemble and orchestra literature 
each title includes individual part assignments authored by respected educators  thereby providing music teachers with a time saving solution for preparing selections for the next public performance 
smartmusic gradebook enables teachers to easily send assignments to each of their students 
students complete the assignment on their home computer provided that they have a smartmusic subscription  or on a school computer equipped with 
table of contents smartmusic 
submitted assignments are automatically graded and posted in the teacher s smartmusic gradebook thereby providing teachers with the visible means for measuring student achievement 
during the third quarter of  we implemented a direct sales initiative for smartmusic 
we hired salespeople to focus on school district sales activities and introduced site licenses offering discounts for volume purchases 
as of december  we had executed site licenses and as of december  we had executed site licenses 
with the release of smartmusic gradebook in  in addition to the total number of subscriptions  we began tracking teachers who use smartmusic as well as the number of those teachers who are using the gradebook to deliver and manage student assignments to fifty students or more formerly known as impact teachers  now gradebook teachers 
as of december   we reported gradebook teachers compared to gradebook teachers as of december  the following table illustrates our quarterly smartmusic metrics dec mar jun sep dec total subscriptions educator accounts educators who have issued assignments gradebook teachers site licenses annual statistics that restart on july of each year reflecting the start of the school year cycle the growth rate in educator accounts experienced in has the potential for sizable growth in student subscriptions 
however  this growth depends upon teachers increasing their utilization of smartmusic gradebook as the means to set up their classes  enroll students and issue frequent smartmusic assignments 
to date  there are not enough teachers that have actively utilized smartmusic gradebook to reflect a significant growth rate in subscriptions which has contributed to student subscriptions lagging behind our expectations 
the smartmusic target business model is based on music educators integrating smartmusic into their teaching and using the smartmusic gradebook to issue frequent assignments which results in an increase in student subscriptions 
as stated above   or  of the teachers who have purchased smartmusic have utilized smartmusic gradebook and those teachers have  students receiving smartmusic assignments 
the total student subscriptions associated with these gradebook accounts are  to accelerate the adoption of this target business model and address the lower than expected subscription rates in  we intend to increase the focus of our direct sales force on existing smartmusic teachers that have not yet utilized impact in their curriculum  and have developed a training program to assist teachers in getting started with smartmusic and smartmusic gradebook 
in addition  our development efforts will be focused on improving and simplifying the smartmusic purchase processes  gradebook class set up  student enrollment and smartmusic assignments 
the overall objective is to make these processes easy and intuitive for both teachers and students 
in the third quarter of  we began tracking new versus renewed smartmusic subscriptions 
the following table illustrates the net new smartmusic subscription data for the quarters ended september  and december  quarterly beginning new renewed subscriptions quarter end net new subscriptions subscriptions subscriptions ended subscriptions subscriptions rd quarter th quarter 
table of contents we define renewed subscriptions as those subscriptions that customers purchase within the two month period after their prior subscription ended 
because of changes to the start of school from year to year as well as fluctuations in the date that music teachers implement their curriculum  we commonly see subscribers that have a delay of up to two months in renewing their subscription 
as a result  we believe that using the above definition of a renewal more accurately reflects the renewal rate for smartmusic subscriptions 
we intend to report smartmusic subscription renewals on a quarterly basis 
we have achieved positive cash flow from operations for the last five years  including the current year ended december  with increased revenues and  in particular  the growth in smartmusic subscriptions  plus improvements in operational efficiency over the last few years  we feel that we can continue to achieve positive operating cash flow on an annual basis in the future 
due to current economic conditions and concerns over school budgets  we are cautious regarding our ability to continue annual profitability 
however  we have established contingency plans that will be implemented if certain revenue and cash flow objectives are not met which we believe will be adequate to maintain positive cash flow 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our distribution in domestic and international markets through independent dealers and distributors concentrates relatively large amounts of receivables in relatively few customer accounts  however  none are greater than of the total revenue 
some international customers pay for the product prior to shipment  domestic dealers and distributors who do not prepay are granted payment terms and credit limits based on credit checks and account history 
we have successfully done business with most of our dealers and distributors for many years 
during fiscal year ended december   we had one distributor that ceased operations and closed its business resulting in a write off of their uncollectible accounts receivable of  there were no significant uncollectible accounts in however  two customer accounts that had ceased operations and were reserved for in were written off during the fiscal year ended december  causing a decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts that year 
any sales directly to home users are prepaid and schools submit purchase orders for purchases 
makemusic records a monthly accrual for potential non payments  which has historically been sufficient to cover uncollected accounts 
financial conditions in international markets and economic conditions can change quickly and our allowance for doubtful accounts cannot anticipate all potential changes 
sales returns and allowance reserves 
smartmusic teacher subscriptions automatically renew at the end of their subscription period 
notices of renewal are sent to the teacher in advance and an invoice is sent upon the renewal date 
a reserve is booked for those subscriptions that automatically renew and are subsequently cancelled due to teacher relocation  teacher cancellation  or non payment of accounts 
the reserve represents the revenue recognized on unpaid invoices for smartmusic subscriptions which are more than days overdue and which have had no activity in the preceding three months 
the reserve is then evaluated quarterly to determine if any adjustments are necessary 
when a new version of finale is released  dealers and distributors retain the right to return any unsold versions of the prior release normally of total prior year sales in exchange for an equal number of units of the updated version of the product that is returned 
the history of these returns is tracked and revenue is deferred based on the expected return rate until the new product is released  at which time the product may be returned for credit provided the customer places an equivalent number of units order for the new version 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a weighted average cost method 
we record a provision to adjust slow moving and obsolete 
table of contents inventories to the lower of cost or market based on historical experience and current product demand 
the carrying value of inventory is evaluated at least quarterly and adjusted as needed 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence when the inventory is no longer used in products in their most current released version 
stock based compensation 
sfas r requires us to measure and recognize in our statements of income the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense we recognize for each option award 
there are several assumptions that we must make when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends payable and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the options and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
an increase in the volatility of our stock price or an increase in the average period before exercise will increase the amount of compensation expense related to awards granted after december  capitalized software costs 
costs incurred in the development of software products are capitalized in accordance with the fasb statement fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which requires the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is established when the detailed program design and all planning and testing activities are completed 
capitalization of computer software costs shall cease when a product is available for general release to customers 
we capitalize the costs of producing any new software product  which in included individual song titles to be included as repertoire with the smartmusic product 
the estimated economic life of smartmusic gradebook  whose capitalization and market introduction was completed in  has been established as five years 
this five year amortization period is consistent with the initial licensing term for the large ensemble titles available in smartmusic that have pre authored assignments for use by teachers within smartmusic impact 
similarly  upon release of a large ensemble song title into smartmusic  we amortize the related capitalized software costs over the estimated life of the song  not to exceed the five year licensing period 
a reserve is recorded for an estimate of song titles that will not be released 
annual development of notation products consists of maintenance costs that are expensed as incurred 
we will continue to review our amortization period for capitalized software costs as considered necessary based upon any new information and information gained in our review of the net realizable value of unamortized costs 
post contract support 
we account for software maintenance in accordance with aicpa sop  software revenue recognition which states that revenue for post contract support pcs may be recognized upon the initial sale when pcs is included with the initial license and the cost of providing pcs during the arrangement is insignificant 
however  the estimated related costs are accrued in the same period that the sales price is recognized 
we provide unlimited  free telephone  e mail  and on line technical support to our customers and  therefore  accrue an estimated cost of future support for our notation products in the period of sale 
impairment of goodwill 
we review goodwill for potential impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
we utilize an analysis of the public market value of our stock as a starting point in assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill is fully recoverable 
the assessment of potential impairment requires certain judgments and estimates by us  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by assets of the company  the risks associated with those cash flows  and the discount rate to be utilized 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions  we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge 
deferred tax assets 
we have us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  and tax credits of approximately  the losses and tax credits are carried forward for federal and state corporate income taxes and may be used to reduce future taxes 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets totaling approximately million 
however  since we currently could not conclude that this net asset is more likely than not to be realized we have recorded a valuation allowance for its full amount 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes key operating information for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands in thousands notation revenue smartmusic revenue other revenue net revenue cost of revenues gross profit percentage of net sales development selling and marketing general administrative total operating expenses operating income other income net income before taxes income tax expense net income year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue increased from  in to  in notation revenue decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  notation revenue decreases are due to the decline in our channel sales due to economic conditions and the release cycle of our products 
notation revenue for the year ended december  included the release of allegro as well as higher sales from the release of finale songwriter which was released late in new versions of allegro and songwriter have historically been released biannually 
smartmusic revenue increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in smartmusic revenue reflects the continued growth of the smartmusic product that was originally launched in and the smartmusic gradebook product that was released in we also introduced smartmusic site licenses in september with the intent of encouraging school district deployments of smartmusic student subscriptions 
additionally  in  we established a direct sales force focused on district level sales 
as of december   there were site licenses for smartmusic with average subscriptions per license of and average potential total of subscriptions per license 

table of contents smartmusic is sold to schools  students and music organization members on a subscription basis 
revenue for these subscriptions is recognized over the life of the subscription which is typically months 
total earned smartmusic subscription revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  over the year ended december  this increase is due to the increase in the total number of subscriptions as well as a price increase in july where teacher subscriptions increased from to and student subscriptions increased from to total unearned smartmusic subscription revenue deferred revenue was  as of december   an increase of  or  over the balance at december  deferred smartmusic revenue represents the future revenue to be recorded on current subscriptions 
smartmusic has shown sustained growth since its launch 
as of december    schools have purchased smartmusic  an increase of over the  schools that had purchased it as of december  total smartmusic subscriptions as of december  number  representing a net gain of  or  over the december  subscription count of  in april  we launched smartmusic gradebook  a web based service that is designed to manage student assignments  recordings and grades while documenting the progress of each student and assessing student achievement 
with the release of smartmusic gradebook  we began tracking teachers that use smartmusic as well as the number of those teachers who are using smartmusic gradebook to deliver and manage student assignments to or more students formerly impact teachers 
as of december   we had smartmusic gradebook teachers with an average of student subscriptions per teacher 
this is an annual statistic  counting only teachers who have issued assignments to or more students during a school fiscal year 
therefore  this is a gain of smartmusic gradebook teachers during the second half of the year as the number of gradebook teachers restarts at zero on july of each year to correspond with the start of the school year 
at december  we reported gradebook teachers with an average of student subscriptions per teacher 
we believe that not enough teachers have actively utilized smartmusic gradebook to reflect a significant growth rate in subscriptions as of december  and we continue to focus specific marketing activities on smartmusic and smartmusic gradebook  including development and market introduction of training materials to facilitate teachers and students getting started with our products 
additionally we intend to increase the focus of our direct sales force on existing smartmusic teachers that have not yet utilized the smartmusic gradebook in their curriculum and anticipate continued growth in the number of new subscriptions in the future 
many smartmusic customers  especially new customers  also purchase accessories primarily microphones and foot pedals that are used with the software 
revenue for the sales of accessories  included in the smartmusic revenue category  for the year ended december   was  which was  or  greater than revenue of  for smartmusic accessories in the year ended december  accessory revenue represented of total gross revenue and of smartmusic revenue in the increase in accessory revenue in is due to the increase in smartmusic subscribers 
additionally  we increased the standard price of microphones from to in january because we expect continuing growth in the number of new smartmusic subscriptions  we also anticipate increases in the amount of revenue we receive from the sales of accessories 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december   due to the increase in revenue 
gross margin percentages decreased primarily due to increased repertoire development amortization costs as a result of our increased number of large ensemble titles and amortization on smartmusic gradebook development costs which began in april cost of revenue includes product costs  royalties paid to publishers  amortization of capitalized notation  repertoire and smartmusic gradebook software development costs  shipping  and credit card fees 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was approximately and for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
development expense 
development expenses increased  from  in to  in development expenses consist primarily of internal payroll  payments to independent contractors  and related expenses for the development of our finale notation  smartmusic  and smartmusic gradebook products  as well as smartmusic repertoire development  business systems  and quality assurance 

table of contents personnel and contract labor costs increased from the prior year due to staff increases in order to achieve numerous product development goals related to simplification of the smartmusic enrollment and purchase processes 
additionally  our business systems expenses increased due to the june completion of our server co location project and expansion of our systems infrastructure to support our anticipated smartmusic subscription growth and provide redundancy in our server infrastructure 
we released new smartmusic large ensemble band  jazz ensemble  and orchestra titles with pre authored assignments in and anticipate releasing additional titles in net content development expenditures of  in and  in related to this additional smartmusic repertoire have been capitalized and are being amortized over their estimated useful life of years 
in addition  during   of development expenditures was capitalized that related to costs for the development of the smartmusic gradebook application 
there were no costs capitalized in for smartmusic gradebook 
we expect development expenses to slightly increase in due to the annualized impact of the headcount and server co location expenses 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of marketing  advertising and promotion expenses  business development and customer service activities  and payroll 
selling and marketing expenses increased from  in to  in this increase of  or  is primarily related to costs associated with establishing a direct sales force  promotional activities including smartmusic marketing videos  development of smartmusic training materials and increased customer support costs as a result of our expanded customer base 
some of these expenses were one time expenses incurred in although we will continue to incur additional costs associated with our increased focus on existing smartmusic educators that have not yet utilized smartmusic gradebook in their curriculum and the ramp up of promotional and public relations activities  we anticipate overall selling and marketing expenses to stabilize in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  professional services  facility costs  bad debt  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  from  in to  in general and administrative costs decreased primarily as a result of a decrease to consulting expenses and by decreases to payroll and benefits related expenses 
consulting expenses were higher in due to sarbanes oxley implementation and the adoption of fin which occurred in the first quarter of partially offsetting these decreases were expenses recorded in the th quarter of of approximately  relating to severance and related costs due to the departure of our founder and former co chief executive officer 
we anticipate general and administrative expenses will decline slightly in due to this staffing reduction 
interest income and expense  net 
net interest income was  for the year ended december   compared to  in net interest income for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income was due to lower interest rates during the year 
income tax 
due to operating losses  we recorded only the minimum taxes due for the years ended december  and because the company could not currently determine that it is more likely than not that the operating loss carry forwards will be realized  there is no tax benefit for loss carry forwards from prior years reflected in the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flow from operating activities was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december   an increase of  the improvements in cash provided by operating activities are primarily a result of the increase in smartmusic subscriptions which increased deferred revenue and changes in accrued liabilities 
actual cash used in operations is typically highest in the first and second quarter  with the third and fourth quarters normally producing positive operating cash flow 
these quarterly fluctuations are created by the notation product release cycle and the cyclical impact of sales to schools related to the school year fiscal calendar 
management expects to achieve positive annual cash flow in the foreseeable future but not  necessarily  in each quarter 
if we do not meet our anticipated revenue levels due to economic conditions  a significantly later than anticipated product release or a decrease in demand for our products  management has identified contingency plans and is committed to expense reductions as necessary to ensure adequate cash levels remain to continue funding operations 
if further expense reductions do not offset this decrease in revenue  we may have to seek 
table of contents additional financing 
there can be no assurances  however  that such financing will be available under attractive terms or at all 
our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for investment in product development 
cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  current year expenditures were  for purchases of property and equipment and  for capitalization of software development  primarily for repertoire development and smartmusic gradebook 
cash provided by financing activities was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the year ended december  this change is primarily due to stock option and warrant activity 
during   was received for the exercise of stock options and warrants  versus  received in the majority of our outstanding warrants expired on february  we do not expect any significant cash to be provided by the exercise of stock options or warrants in due to our current stock price 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and as of december   the balance was  contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations consist of future minimum lease payments due under non cancelable capital and operating leases as follows capital operating lease lease total lease obligations obligations obligations in thousands thereafter from time to time we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december  no such losses existed
