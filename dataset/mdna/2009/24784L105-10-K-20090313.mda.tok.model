company overview since our founding in  we have established a leading position as a provider of enterprise applications software and related services designed and developed specifically for project focused organizations 
these organizations include architectural and engineering firms  government contractors  aerospace and defense contractors  information technology services firms  consulting companies  discrete project manufacturing companies  grant based not for profit organizations and government agencies  among others 
these project focused organizations generate revenue from defined customer specific engagements or activities 
project focused organizations typically require specialized software to help them automate complex business processes around the engagement  execution and delivery of projects 
our software applications enable project focused companies to significantly enhance the visibility they have over all aspects of their operations by providing them increased control over their critical business processes  accurate  project specific financial information  and real time performance measurements 
with our software applications  project focused organizations can better measure business results  optimize performance  streamline operations  enabling them to win new business  operate more effectively and improve profitability 
as of december   we had over  customers worldwide that spanned numerous project focused industries and ranged in size from small organizations to large enterprises 
our revenue is generated from sales of software licenses and related software maintenance and support agreements and professional services to assist customers with the implementation of our products  as well as education and training services 
our continued growth depends  in part  on our ability to generate software license fee revenues from new customers and to continue to expand our presence within our existing installed base of customers 
in our management decision making  we continuously balance our need to achieve short term financial goals with the equally critical need to continuously invest in our products and infrastructure to ensure our future success 
in making decisions around spending levels in our various functional organizations  we consider many factors  including our ability to expand our presence and penetration of existing markets  the extent to which we can sell new products to existing customers and sell upgrades to applications from legacy products in our current portfolio  our success in expanding our network of alliance partners  our ability to expand our presence in new markets and broaden our reach geographically  and the pursuit and successful integration of acquired companies 
we have acquired companies to broaden our product offerings  expand our customer base and provide us with a future opportunity to migrate those added customers to newer applications we may develop 
the products 
table of contents of the acquired companies provide our customers with core functionality that complements our own established products 
in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance  we consider a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the following the growth rates of the individual components of our revenues licenses  services and support relative to recent historical trends and the growth rate of the overall market as reported or predicted by industry analysts  the gross margins of our business relative to recent historical trends  our operating expenses and income from operations  our cash flow from operations  the long term success of our development efforts  our ability to successfully penetrate new markets  our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and achieve anticipated synergies  our win rate against our competitors  our long term customer retention rates  and our long term adjusted ebitda margin trends 
each of the factors may be evaluated individually or collectively by our senior management team in evaluating our performance as we balance our short term quarterly objectives and our strategic goals and objectives 
since  we have substantially increased our investments in product development  sales and marketing to increase our presence in our targeted markets so as to raise awareness among our potential customers and compete more aggressively 
we believe that these additional investments have been instrumental in further improving our competitive position and driving our growth in total revenues since while we expect to control our operating expenses and manage our cash flow in light of the prevailing financial and economic conditions  we expect to continue our investments in product development  sales and marketing according to the anticipated demand for our various products during the year ended december  consistent with our expectations that the current economic recession will continue during the year ending december   we expect to focus our spending on product development  sales and marketing efforts on our key markets and products 
we also believe that our international expansion plans will require continued investment in local marketing initiatives 
we may also acquire businesses or complementary products to facilitate our growth objectives 
in light of current economic conditions and to realign our resources to accomplish our strategic goals and objectives  we undertook a reduction in force in and which  we believe better positions us to accomplish our goals and objectives 
as a result of the current economic recession  our software license fee revenue attributable to our vision product was impacted as a number of architecture and engineering customers deferred purchasing decisions  lengthened sales cycles and slowed the adoption of new technologies 
while the timing and extent of any economic recovery is uncertain  we expect these trends to continue during the year ending december  in addition  we may experience a decline in demand during for consulting  maintenance and support services from our architecture and engineering customers due to the impact of the recession 
our government contracting customers were less impacted by the recession due to the increase in government spending in and  as a result  our sales of software licenses for our costpoint  gcs premier and enterprise product management epm products were less affected by the recession 
while the timing and extent of any economic recovery is uncertain  we expect these products to account for a larger percentage of our 
table of contents overall software license fee revenue as a result of increased government spending  increased regulation by government agencies and the impact of the economic stimulus package on government contracting customers 
we also expect these trends to positively impact demand during for our consulting  maintenance and support services 
history we were founded in to develop and sell accounting software solutions for firms that contract with the us government 
since our founding  we have continued our focus on providing solutions to government contractors as well as to other project focused organizations  and at the same time we have broadened our product offerings by developing new software products  selectively acquiring businesses with attractive project focused applications and services  and partnering with third parties 
in april  the new mountain funds purchased the majority ownership of our company from the founding delaski stockholders through a recapitalization 
immediately after this transaction  we implemented a strategy to recruit additional management talent and significantly improve our competitive position and growth prospects through increased investments in product development  sales and marketing initiatives  complemented by strategic acquisitions aimed at broadening our customer base and our product offerings 
in october  we acquired wind  an enterprise software provider serving project focused a e and other professional services firms 
the acquisition of wind enabled us to expand our presence in the a e market by adding small and medium sized engineering firms to our existing customer base 
in march  we acquired wst  inc welcom  a leading provider of project portfolio management solutions  focused on earned value management  planning and scheduling  portfolio analysis  risk management and project collaboration products 
the acquisition of welcom increased our presence among a number of multinational aerospace  defense and government clients  augmenting our existing installed base of customers 
this acquisition complemented our core product offerings and created opportunities for additional sales to our existing customer base 
in july  we acquired c s solutions  inc cssi  a leading provider of business intelligence tools for the earned value management marketplace 
the acquisition of cssi built upon our leadership position in the enterprise project management sector by incorporating collaborative earned value management analytics delivered by cssi s winsight software with our own earned value management engine  cobra  and costpoint  our enterprise resource planning solution for mid to large sized government contractors 
in april  we acquired the business assets of applied integration management corporation aim  a provider of project management consulting services 
this acquisition supplemented our existing project portfolio management systems implementation expertise and capabilities and allowed us to provide additional project portfolio management consulting  training and implementation services 
in april  we reincorporated in the state of delaware as deltek  inc in may  we completed the acquisition of wst pacific pty ltd 
wstp  a provider of earned value management evm solutions based in australia  and previously a development partner of welcom 
the acquisition complemented our existing evm development  services and support resources 
in november  the company completed its initial public offering consisting of  shares of common stock for per share 
for additional information regarding the initial public offering  see the initial public offering section of note in our consolidated financial statements contained in item in this annual report on form k 
in august  we acquired the mpm solution mpm and all related assets from planview  inc  an earned value management software application used by government contractors and agencies to meet complex 
table of contents compliance requirements for their programs issued by the federal government 
mpm integrates with deltek winsight to create a complete earned value solution for government contractors and agencies 
critical accounting policies and estimates in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
future results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies  see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa  and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from three primary sources  or elements software license fees for our products  maintenance and support for those products  and consulting services  including training  related to those products 
a typical sales agreement includes both software licenses and maintenance and may also include consulting services  including training 
software license fee revenues for sales arrangements involving multiple elements where the software does not require significant modification or customization  we recognize software license fee revenues using the residual method as described in sop because to date we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the license element 
under the residual method  we allocate revenue to  and defer recognition of  undelivered elements based on their vsoe of fair value and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as revenue for the delivered elements 
the objectively determined fair value of the undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements is based on the price charged when such elements are sold separately 
our typical undelivered elements maintenance and consulting services are priced consistently at stated amounts in a high percentage of our arrangements such that vsoe generally exists for undelivered elements of our arrangements 
if vsoe exists to allow the allocation of a portion of the total fee to undelivered elements of the arrangement  the residual amount in the arrangement allocated to software license fee is recognized as revenue when all of the following are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our practice to require a signed contract or an accepted purchase order for existing customers 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software by both physical and secure electronic means 
both means of delivery transfer title and risk to the customer 
shipping terms are generally fob shipping point 

table of contents the software license sale is fixed and determinable 
we recognize revenue for the license component of multiple element arrangements only when the fair value of any undelivered elements is known  any uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no refund  return or cancellation rights associated with the delivered elements 
software license sales are generally considered fixed and determinable when payment terms are less than six months 
collectability is probable 
amounts receivable must be collectible 
for license arrangements that do not meet our collectability standards  revenue is recognized as cash is received 
consulting services revenues our consulting services revenues  which include software implementation  training and other consulting services  are generally billed based on hourly rates plus reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
these services are generally not essential to the functionality of our software and are usually completed in three to six months  though larger implementations may take longer 
we generally recognize revenues for these services as they are performed 
in rare situations in which the services are deemed essential to the functionality of our software in the customer s environment  we recognize the software and services revenue together in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
we sell training at a fixed rate for each specific class  at a per attendee price  or at a packaged price for several attendees  and revenue is recognized only when the customer attends and completes the training 
we also provide training services at a standard rate per hour at our customers sites 
to the extent that our customers pay for the training services in advance of delivery  the amounts are recorded in deferred revenue until such time as the training is provided 
maintenance and support services revenues maintenance and support services include software updates on a when and if available basis  telephone  online and web based support and software defect fixes or patches 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the customer maintenance and support agreement 
the significant judgments and estimates for revenue recognition typically relate to the timing of an amount recognized for software license fee revenue  including whether collectability is deemed probable  fees are fixed and determinable and services are essential to the functionality of the software 
changes to these assumptions would generally impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized for software license fee revenues versus other revenue categories 
stock based compensation sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including employee stock options  restricted stock awards  and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase program espp  based on the fair value of the award on the measurement date of grant 
we determine the fair value of options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing model and recognized the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
in accordance with sfas r  we recorded million  million  and million in stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the compensation expense recorded for the year ended december  related to stock options  restricted stock awards and the espp 
for the year ended december   the compensation expense recorded related to stock options and espp  and for the year ended december  compensation expense related to stock options 
the key assumptions used by management in the black scholes merton option pricing model include the fair value of our common stock at the grant date  which is also used to determine the option exercise price  the 
table of contents expected life of the option  the expected volatility of our common stock over the life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
in determining the amount of stock based compensation to record  management must also estimate expected forfeitures of stock options over the expected life of the options 
prior to our initial public offering in november and given the absence of an active market for our common stock  our board of directors or compensation committee or its authorized member s estimated the fair value of our common stock at the time of each grant 
numerous objective and subjective factors were considered in estimating the value of our common stock at each option grant date in accordance with the guidance in aicpa practice aid valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
based on these factors  employee stock options were granted during at exercise prices ranging from to and during at exercise prices ranging from to 
our initial public offering in november was per share 
based  in part  upon subsequent valuations  the compensation committee of our board reassessed the estimated fair value of certain stock options previously granted during the first ten months of as a result of the reassessment  stock option awards granted to employees and directors were determined to have been made at exercise prices below the reassessed fair value on the date of grant 
as a result  those option grants were modified to increase the exercise price to be equal to the revised assessment of the fair value on the date of grant 
the option prices for those grants were adjusted upward from the original fair values ranging from to to revised fair values which ranged from to 
no incremental compensation cost resulted from the modifications since the exercise prices were increased 
the weighted average intrinsic value of all stock options at the modification date  where applicable  was zero 
valuation methodology from january  through the initial public offering  the valuation method that we used to estimate the fair value of our common stock utilized a combination of a market multiple methodology and a comparable transaction methodology 
the market multiple methodology considered market valuation multiples of similar enterprise application software firms the comparable software companies 
we selected seven comparable companies that met the following criteria the company was primarily engaged in the enterprise software business  the company was publicly held and actively traded  and the enterprise value of the company was less than billion 
based on an analysis of the valuation multiples of the comparable software companies  we determined an appropriate multiple to apply to the relevant values for our cumulative earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  recapitalization expenses and stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda for the four quarters ended prior to the valuation date  our estimated adjusted ebitda for the current period  determined as of the valuation date based on management s estimates  and for periods beginning in october  our estimated adjusted ebitda for the result of this calculation was an estimate of our enterprise value using market multiples of comparable software companies 
the comparable transaction methodology considered market valuation multiples of over software company acquisition transactions announced since early we selected transactions for this methodology from databases of publicly announced and completed controlling interest transactions involving enterprise 
table of contents software companies valued between million and billion 
the analysis of comparable transactions included for each valuation was consistently updated to include transactions announced and completed since the prior valuation 
the factors considered in our comparable transaction methodology analysis were the acquired company s enterprise value to revenue multiple and its enterprise value to adjusted ebitda ratio 
after analysis of the range of values of those comparable transactions as well as their mean and median values  a range of comparable enterprise value multiples that considered our growth rate and adjusted ebitda margin levels was applied to our revenue and adjusted ebitda levels 
we further adjusted this value to remove the estimated impact of the control premium from the market multiples used 
the result of this calculation was an estimate of our enterprise value using comparable transaction multiples of other acquired software firms 
the application of the market multiple methodology and the comparable transaction methodology was equally weighted and yielded an estimated enterprise value which we then adjusted for our cash and debt balances to estimate the aggregate value of our common stock 
we then adjusted that valuation for a marketability discount ranging from to depending upon the proximity of an expected liquidity event such as our planned initial public offering to reflect the fact that our shares were not publicly tradable 
the resulting valuation of our company was used to determine the estimated fair value of our common stock at the valuation date 
subsequent to our initial public offering in november  the fair value of our common stock has been determined based upon the closing stock market value 
because we do not have significant history associated with our stock options in order to determine the expected volatility of our options  we calculated expected volatility as of each grant date under both sfas and sfas r using an implied volatility method based in part on reported data for a peer group of publicly traded software companies for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use peer group volatility information until sufficient historical volatility of our common stock is available to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life of our stock options was determined according to the sec simplified method as described in sab no 
 share based payment  which is the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate was determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve rates with the remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical analysis of actual stock option forfeitures and employee turnover 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision or benefit for taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty for income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we adopted fin effective january  fin requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition and measurement of tax positions can affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our operating results 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million  which were primarily related to differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for book and tax purposes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance equal to the million of the deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carry forwards as there was not sufficient evidence at that time to enable us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
during  we made certain changes to our transfer pricing agreements 
as a result of this change in geographic distribution of income we released all of the million valuation allowance as we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the tax benefits associated with our foreign losses 

table of contents prior to our recapitalization in april  we were organized as an s corporation under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and as a result were not subject to federal income taxes 
as an s corporation  we made periodic distributions to our stockholders that covered the stockholders anticipated tax liability 
in connection with the recapitalization in april  we converted our us taxable status from an s corporation to a c corporation as defined by the code 
consequently  since april we have been subject to federal and state income taxes 
upon the conversion  we recorded a one time benefit of million to establish a deferred tax asset relating to differences between the book and tax basis of certain operating assets and liabilities and the acquired tax net operating loss carryforwards of semaphore  inc  which we acquired in august under the terms of the april recapitalization agreement  the tax benefit portion of the recapitalization expenses attributable to the settlement of certain stock appreciation rights held by employees is payable to the selling stockholder group in the recapitalization 
the liability to the selling stockholder group is reflected as accrued liability for redemption of stock in recapitalization in the accompanying balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if a change to the expected tax rate is determined to be appropriate due to differences between our assumptions and actual results of operations or statutory tax rates  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales allowances to provide adequate provision for potential losses from collecting less than full payment on our accounts receivable 
we record provisions for sales allowances  which generally result from credits issued to customers in conjunction with cancellations of maintenance agreements or billing adjustments  as a reduction to revenues 
we record provisions for bad debt  or credit losses  as a general and administrative expense in our income statement 
we base these provisions on a review of our accounts receivable aging  individual overdue accounts  historical write offs and adjustments of customer accounts due to service or other issues and an assessment of the general economic environment 
valuation of purchased intangible assets and acquired deferred revenue we allocate the purchase price paid in a business combination to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets 
we amortize acquired intangible assets using either accelerated or straight line methods depending upon which best approximates the proportion of future cash flows estimated to be generated in each period of the estimated useful life of the specific asset 
management must estimate the expected life and future cash flows from the acquired asset  both of which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
changes in the assumptions used in developing these estimates could have a material impact on the amortization expense recorded in our financial statements 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of our assumptions and estimates 
as an example  for all of the acquisitions made during   and  we are amortizing the customer relationship intangible assets on an accelerated method using lives of five to nine years 
the use of an accelerated method was based upon our estimates of the projected cash 
table of contents flows from the assets and the proportion of those cash flows received over the estimated life 
had we used a straight line method of amortization  amortization expense for would have been approximately million less than the amount recorded 
if we were to continue to use the same accelerated method  but reduce the estimated useful lives of those assets by one year  total amortization expense would have been higher by million for we amortize acquired technology from our acquisitions using either an accelerated or a straight line method over three to four years 
if the useful lives for those assets were reduced by one year  amortization expense for would have been approximately million which is million lower than the current year expense 
as a component of our acquisitions  we acquired maintenance obligations and the associated deferred revenue with our acquisitions 
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting in a business combination for deferred revenue of an acquiree  and eitf issue no 
 accounting in a business combination for deferred post contract customer support revenue of a software vendor  clarified different methods to determine the fair value of deferred revenue in a business combination 
in accordance with eitf guidance  we valued acquired deferred revenue based on estimates of the cost of providing solution support services and software error corrections plus a reasonable profit margin 
the impact of our valuation was a write down of the acquired deferred revenue balances to an average of of their book value on the date of acquisition  from a total of million to million 
this reduced amount will be recognized as revenue over the remaining contractual period of the obligation  generally no more than one year from the date of acquisition 
changes in the estimates used in determining these valuations could result in more or less revenue being recorded 
impairment of identifiable intangible and other long lived assets and goodwill we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired or unrecoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we test our goodwill for impairment annually at december or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment is indicated 
the impairment is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its fair value 
factors that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets that may not be recoverable include under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes or limitations in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  changes in our business strategy  adverse market conditions  changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other factors and circumstances 
if we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to our current estimates of net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or fair market value 
we recognize an impairment charge  as an operating expense  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset in the period the determination is made

table of contents software license fees our software applications are generally licensed to end user customers under perpetual license agreements 
we sell our software applications to end user customers mainly through our direct sales force  as well as indirectly through our network of alliance partners and resellers 
the timing of the sales cycle for our products varies in length based upon a variety of factors  including the size of the customer  the product being sold and whether the customer is a new or existing customer 
we primarily compete on product features  functionality and the needs of our customers within our served markets  with price generally a lesser consideration 
the pricing for our products has remained stable  requiring infrequent changes in our pricing strategies 
software license fee revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   revenues from vision software license fees decreased million compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a number of architecture and engineering customers that deferred purchasing decisions  lengthened sales cycles and slowed the adoption of new technologies as their focus turned to the impact of the escalating financial crisis on their businesses in the latter half of while the timing and extent of any financial or economic turnaround is uncertain  we expect these recent trends in the architecture and engineering market to continue during the year ending december  as customers in this market continue to wait for signs of an economic recovery 
software license fee revenue from our costpoint  gcs premier  and enterprise project management epm products increased from the prior year by million driven by continued demand for our products by government contractor customers as they were less affected by the global economic recession due to the continued increase in government spending 
we expect this trend to continue into due to increased government spending  increased regulation by government agencies and the impact that the economic stimulus package in the united states will have on government contractor customers 
as a result  we expect that costpoint  gcs premier and epm software license fees to account for a larger percentage of our overall software license fee revenues 
software license fee revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  software license fee revenues from our costpoint  gcs premier  and epm products grew by million compared to the year ended december  software license fee revenues from our vision product family increased million compared with the year ended december  consulting services our consulting services revenues are generated from software implementation and related project management and data conversion  as well as training  education and other consulting services associated with our software applications and are typically provided on a time and materials basis 
consulting services revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in revenue year over year was driven by an increase of million of software implementation related services in addition to an increase of million in training and education related services revenue in the increase in software implementation related services was a result of increased demand for implementation services and more billable services headcount 
implementation services represented of total consulting revenues for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we expect continued demand in for consulting services from our government contracting customers due to anticipated increases in government spending 
conversely  we may experience a decline in demand in for consulting services from our architecture and engineering customers due to the impact of the global economic recession 
consulting services revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was the result of a million increase in software implementation related services revenue and a million increase in training 
table of contents and education related services revenue during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the million increase in implementation services was driven by increased software license sales and includes million of revenue associated with our acquisition of aim during implementation services represented of total consulting services revenues for each of the years ended december  and december  maintenance and support services our maintenance and support revenues are comprised of fees derived from new maintenance contracts associated with new software license sales and annual renewals of existing maintenance contracts 
these contracts typically allow our customers to obtain online  telephone and internet based support  as well as unspecified periodic upgrades or enhancements to our software on an as available basis 
maintenance services are typically billed on a quarterly basis and generally represent between and of the list price of the underlying software applications at the time of sale 
maintenance fees are generally subject to contractually permitted annual rate increases 
maintenance revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  maintenance revenues from our costpoint  gcs premier  and epm products collectively increased million year over year and maintenance revenues from our vision product increased million 
these increases were due to sales of new software licenses  renewals of maintenance agreements on our installed base of customers  and the annual price escalations for our maintenance services 
these increases were partially offset by customer cancellations 
in  we expect that our maintenance revenues attributed to new software licenses from government contracting customers will be positively impacted by the anticipated increase in government spending 
conversely  we expect that our maintenance revenues attributed to new software licenses from architecture and engineering customers will be negatively impacted by the global economic recession 
maintenance revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  maintenance revenues from our vision product family grew by million  or  and maintenance revenues from our costpoint  gcs premier  and epm products grew by million 
these increases were driven by our sales of new software licenses and renewals of maintenance agreements in our installed base of customers

cost of software license fees decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of decreased royalty expense for third party software of million driven by lower software license sales during the year ended december  in addition  there was a decrease in amortization from purchased intangibles of million and capitalized software of million 
the decrease in amortization of software development costs was a result of a previously capitalized software becoming fully amortized in the prior year resulting in no current year expense 
cost of software license fees increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was a result of approximately million in additional royalty expense for third party software resulting from higher software license sales during the year and million of additional amortization of purchased intangibles 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of capitalized software of approximately million

recapitalization in april  we underwent a recapitalization in which we issued  shares of common stock to the new mountain funds for million 
we also sold million of subordinated debentures to the new mountain funds and million of subordinated debentures to one of the selling stockholders collectively  the subordinated debentures or the debentures 
in addition  we secured a million term loan as part of the recapitalization 
see note  recapitalization and note  debt of our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
the million total proceeds from the term loan and the issuance of the common stock and subordinated debentures were primarily used to repurchase common stock from the selling stockholders to reduce their aggregate holdings to of the outstanding shares  to make payments of approximately million to holders of stock appreciation rights issued under our stock appreciation rights plan sar plan and to pay for the costs of the recapitalization  totaling approximately million  and to pay million for debt issuance costs 
in connection with the recapitalization  we issued to the new mountain funds shares of series a preferred stock  par value per share  as to which the holders had no voting rights  but were entitled to elect a majority of the members of our board of directors until such time that the common stock owned by the new mountain funds constituted less than one third of our outstanding common stock 
after such time  the holders of series a preferred stock had the right to elect one or more directors  declining in number as the holder s common stock ownership declines 
in connection with our reincorporation in delaware  our series a preferred stock was converted into class a common stock with the same substantive terms 
the series a preferred stock carried no other voting rights  no dividend entitlement and no liquidation preferences 
pursuant to the recapitalization  we became obligated to make a payment to the selling stockholders equal to the amount of income taxes that we would be required to pay  but for the availability of deductions related to the sar payments made in connection with the recapitalization 
the amount and timing of the additional payments to the selling stockholders was contingent on the use and timing of the sar deductions to offset cash tax payments that we would otherwise have made

table of contents credit agreement in connection with the company s recapitalization in  we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by credit suisse that provided for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility the credit agreement 
in april  we added million to the term loan to repay the outstanding debentures 
the term loan matures on april   and the revolving credit facility terminates on april  as of december  and december  the outstanding amount of the term loan is million and million  respectively  and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
term loans under the credit agreement accrue interest at either or above the libo rate 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at either or above the libo rate 
the spread above the libo rate decreases as our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  decreases and as we achieve specified credit ratings 
at our option  the interest rate on loans under the credit agreement may be based on an alternative base prime rate the abr rate  and the margins over abr are less than the margins over the libo rate 
we pay a commitment fee of per year on the unused amount of our revolving credit facility 
all the loans under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets including our subsidiaries assets and require us to comply with financial covenants requiring us to maintain defined minimum levels of interest coverage and fixed charges coverage and providing for a limitation on our leverage ratio 
the following table summarizes the significant financial covenants under the credit agreement adjusted ebitda below is as defined in the credit agreement covenant requirement calculation as of december  most restrictive required level required level actual level minimum interest coverage cumulative adjusted ebitda for the prior four quarters consolidated interest expense greater than to greater than to effective january  minimum fixed charges coverage cumulative adjusted ebitda for the prior four quarters interest expense principal payments capital expenditures capitalized software costs cash tax payments greater than greater than leverage coverage total debt cumulative adjusted ebitda for the prior four quarters less than to less than to effective january  the credit agreement requires us to comply with non financial covenants that restrict certain corporate activities by us and our subsidiaries  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  guarantee obligations  or create liens on our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in mergers or consolidations  or pay cash dividends 
based on our current and expected performance  we believe we will continue to satisfy the financial covenants of our credit agreement for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to our credit agreement 
in  the costs incurred in connection with the addition to the term loan were million 
we incurred no debt issuance costs in and 
table of contents the debt issuance costs are being amortized and reflected in interest expense over the respective lives of the loans 
at december   million of unamortized debt issuance costs remained in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million was reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
during the year ended december    and  million  million and million of costs were amortized  respectively  and reflected in interest expense 
the december  and amount included and million  respectively  of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs for a required repayment on the term loan during the fourth quarter of and for stockholder debt repaid in during the fourth quarter of  we used net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay million of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and used the remaining balance of the proceeds to repay million of the indebtedness under the term loan 
as a result  we accelerated million of debt issuance cost amortization in the fourth quarter of as a result of the required repayment on the term loan 
in addition to scheduled principal payments  the credit agreement also requires mandatory prepayments of the term loan from annual excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement  and from the net proceeds of certain asset sales or equity issuances 
the company made a scheduled principal payment of  on december  and will make another scheduled principal payment of  on march  the company will also make a mandatory prepayment of million on march  from its annual excess cash flow 
this payment will be applied against any scheduled principal payments for the twelve month period following the excess cash flow payment 
a principal payment will also be due on june  in the amount of  at the end of each of the quarters ending september   december  and march   a scheduled principal payment of million will be due  with a final installment representing the balance due on april   the final maturity date 
at december   the entire amount of million under the revolving credit facility remained available 
liquidity and capital resources overview of liquidity our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of salaries  incentive compensation and related benefits and other headcount related costs as well as the costs of office facilities and information technology systems 
we fund these requirements through cash collections from our customers for the purchase of our software  consulting services and maintenance services 
amounts due from customers for software license and maintenance services are generally billed at the beginning of the contract term 
the cost of our recent acquisitions has been financed with available cash flow and  to the extent necessary  short term borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
these borrowings are repaid in subsequent periods with available cash provided by operating activities 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
historically our cash flows have been subject to variability from year to year primarily as a result of one time or infrequent events 
for example  in  we refinanced our stockholder notes  which did not require any interest payment in  with an incremental term loan which requires quarterly interest payments 
this refinancing shifted the cash payment of million for interest accrued into we expect that our future growth will continue to require additional working capital 
we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available sources of funds including available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will 
table of contents provide sufficient liquidity for us to fund our business and meet our obligations for the next months 
however  we may require liquidity in addition to our existing cash balances and future cash flow from operations to fund future business needs and debt repayment obligations beyond the next months by raising additional funds or refinancing our debt 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our initial public offering 
the net proceeds to the company were million which were used to repay a million balance on our revolving credit facility and to make a million prepayment on our term loan 
analysis of cash flows for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million provided during the comparable period of this increase of million is primarily driven by the additional cash associated with increased customer payments of million offset by higher cash payments for income taxes and other expenses in the current year 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million provided during the comparable period of this increase of million is primarily driven by the additional cash associated with the increase in net income of million along with other net increases in cash provided by operating activities offset by higher cash payments for income taxes of million in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used during the comparable period of the increase of million is due to cash used in of for the acquisition of mpm  aim contingent consideration of million  and additional consideration for welcom of million as compared to for which we paid million for aim and wstp 
other cash used in investing activities of million was associated with purchases of property and equipment in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used during the comparable period of the decrease was primarily due to two acquisitions  aim and wstp which accounted for million of our overall cash usage 
the remaining use of cash during this period was million for purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided during the year ended december  this decrease is due to proceeds from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of of million  million in proceeds from the issuance of debt in  offset by higher debt repayments of million in in addition  proceeds from exercise of stock options and the related tax benefit were higher by million in the proceeds from the stock option activity in was offset by million in payments made in to stockholders and the redemption of stock in relation to our capitalization 
we used million in net proceeds from our initial public offering to pay down million of indebtedness on our outstanding revolving credit facility and million on our term loan 
as of december  we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided during the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  the initial public offering contributed cash of million from the sale of common stock and million in proceeds related to the exercise of stock options and related tax benefit 
we used million in net proceeds to pay down million of indebtedness on our outstanding revolving credit facility and million on our term loan 
in  we retired our subordinated debentures with million of additional borrowings under our credit agreement 
we also incurred million of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility and received million in proceeds from the sale of common stock 
these borrowings financed the payment of a million liability to certain of the selling stockholders arising from the recapitalization  and the payment of million in principal reductions on the term loan and million in debt issuance costs 
the net cash provided by these borrowings was also used to finance part of the cost of the cssi acquisition 

table of contents impact of seasonality fluctuations in our quarterly software license fee revenues reflect in part  seasonal fluctuations driven by our customers procurement cycles for enterprise software and other factors 
these factors have historically yielded a peak in software license fee revenue in the fourth quarter due to increased spending by our customers during that time 
however  for the year ended december   our fourth quarter software license fee revenues was not our highest quarter  due in part to financial and economic conditions prevailing at that time 
consequently  past seasonality may not be indicative of current or future seasonality 
our consulting services revenues are impacted by software license sales  the availability of our consulting resources to work on customer implementations  and the adequacy of our contracting activity to maintain full utilization of our available resources 
as a result  services revenues are much less subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our maintenance revenues are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations although cash flow from maintenance fees is impacted by the timing of annual maintenance renewals  which are usually higher in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our material capital commitments consist of term loan related debt obligations and commitments under facilities and operating leases 
we rarely enter into binding purchase commitments 
the following table summarizes our existing contractual obligations and contractual commitments as of december  payments due by december  contractual obligations total thereafter dollars in thousands term loan operating leases liability for redemption of stock in recapitalization the table above does not include interest payments with respect to the outstanding term loan  which are variable and therefore fluctuate with interest rate fluctuations 
based on the variable rate debt outstanding as of december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis 
following the repayment of million in the fourth quarter of  our scheduled repayments of the outstanding term loan balance are million in  which includes a scheduled repayment of million and a prepayment of million  million in  and a scheduled principal repayment of million in however  the amount and timing of these scheduled payments could vary based on the required mandatory prepayments from our annual excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement 
the above table does not include approximately million of long term income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with fin because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these potential future payments 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt and cash and cash equivalents consisting primarily of funds held in money market accounts on a short term basis with no withdrawal restrictions and contain no significant investments in auction rate securities 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
our interest expense associated with our term loan and revolving credit facility will vary with market rates 
as of december   we had approximately million in variable rate debt outstanding 
based upon the variable rate debt outstanding as of december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our variable rate debt  or whether fixed rate long term debt will be available to us at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the hypothetical increase discussed above 
based on the investment interest rate and our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december   a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  the philippine peso  and the australian dollar 
as our international operations continue to grow  we may choose to use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 
we do not currently have any such contracts in place  nor did we have any such contracts during   or to date  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our operating results and cash flows given the scope of our international presence
