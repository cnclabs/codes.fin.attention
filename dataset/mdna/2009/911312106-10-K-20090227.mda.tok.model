next day air volume  deferred air volume and ground volume declined   and  respectively for the year  primarily as a result of the current us recession 
these declining volume trends worsened through the year with next day air  deferred air  and ground volume declining   and  respectively  during the fourth quarter 
relatively high energy costs during most of the year combined with the deepening recession and weak output within the industrial production and retail sales sectors adversely affected the small package market  which places additional pressure on our domestic package volume 
the increase in overall revenue per piece of resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect during the first quarter and higher fuel surcharge rates  but was partially offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix 
next day air and deferred revenue per piece increased and  respectively  and were positively impacted by the base rate increase and a higher fuel surcharge rate for air products discussed further below 
this increase was adversely impacted by lower average package weights  a mix shift toward lower yielding products  and hedging losses 
ground revenue per piece increased  mainly due to the rate increase  as well as a higher fuel surcharge rate due to increased diesel fuel prices in compared with on november   we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on december  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground

the absence of these charges in favorably affected the operating profit comparison between periods 
operating profit in was adversely impacted by the current us recession  lower asset utilization due to the decline in volume  lower average package weights  and a shift in product mix away from our premium services  partially offset by the increase in the fuel surcharge relative to the cost of fuel 
because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of the year  operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments 
because of this time lag  fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during  which is opposite of the effect the company experienced in  when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted 
compared to us domestic package revenue increased million  or  in  due to a improvement in revenue per piece and a increase in average daily package volume 
next day air volume increased and ground volume increased for the year  largely as a result of a solid peak season in the fourth quarter  when our next day air volume rose and ground volume increased 
deferred air volume declined in our domestic air and ground products have been impacted by the slowing us economy and weak small package market in trends in us industrial production and business to consumer shipments in were not favorable to the overall small package market  which places pressure on our domestic package volume 
the increase in overall revenue per piece of in resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect earlier in the year  but was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue and an unfavorable shift in product mix 
next day air revenue per piece declined  and was negatively impacted by strong growth in our lower yielding next day air saver products 
deferred revenue per piece increased only 
the change in revenue per piece for all our air products was negatively impacted by a lower fuel surcharge rate discussed further below 
ground revenue per piece increased  primarily due to the rate increase  but was also impacted slightly by a higher fuel surcharge due to higher diesel fuel prices in compared with overall product mix reduced revenue per piece  as our premium air products suffered volume declines while our ground volume grew 
consistent with the practice in previous years  a rate increase took effect on january  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground 
other pricing changes included a increase in the residential surcharge  and a increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts

the ground fuel surcharge rate continued to fluctuate based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was in  an increase from in  due to higher diesel fuel prices 
as a result of the air products index rate reduction and fuel market price movements  total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by million in us domestic package incurred an operating loss of billion in  compared with a billion operating profit in  largely due to a billion charge related to our withdrawal from the central states pension fund 
additionally  domestic package operating results were negatively impacted by low revenue 
table of contents growth  the aircraft impairment charge  the svso charge  and the impact of fuel 
the aircraft impairment and svso charges reduced domestic operating profit by million and million  respectively 
fuel negatively impacted the change in operating profit during  as fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate 
these factors were partially offset by cost controls  including  among other categories  lower self insurance expense 
the expense associated with our self insurance accruals for workers compensation claims  automotive liability and general business liabilities declined as a result of several factors 
the central states pension fund withdrawal  aircraft impairment  and svso charges  as well as the impact of lower self insurance expense  are discussed further in the operating expenses section 
international package operations compared to international package revenue improved billion  or  for the year  driven by a volume increase for our export products and a increase in total revenue per piece 
the growth in revenue per piece was primarily due to rate increases  the impact of currency exchange rates  and increased fuel surcharge rates

additionally  we modified the fuel surcharge on certain us related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 
the fuel surcharge for products originating outside the united states continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions  depending upon where the shipment takes place 
total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by million in  due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume 

table of contents international package operating profit decreased million  or  in  and the operating margin declined to from in the decline in operating profit and operating margin were affected by reduced asset utilization resulting from changes in economic conditions and trade flows  such as the reduced import volume into the united states 
operating profit and margin were also negatively affected by a shift in product mix away from our premium services  as well as expenses associated with integration activities in our delivery network 
global economic weakness resulted in a weakening operating profit trend  with fourth quarter operating profit declining because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of the year  operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments 
as a result of this time lag  fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during  which is opposite of the effect the company experienced in  when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted

export volume increased throughout the world 
asian export volume grew strongly in key markets during the year  especially china 
asian export volume continues to benefit from our geographic service expansion  as well as strong economic growth  which benefits our intra asian package business 
to continue this expansion  we received authority in to operate six daily flights between the us and nagoya  japan  and began constructing a package and freight air hub in shanghai  china that will link shanghai to our international air network  with direct service to europe  asia  and the americas 
european export volume also grew solidly  largely due to continued growth in the transborder business and improved economic and industrial output in the european union

international package operating profit was adversely affected in by charges related to the aircraft impairment million and the svso million  both of which are discussed further in the operating expenses section 
operating profit was negatively impacted by fuel  as the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was more than offset by the increase in fuel expense 
the adverse impact of the aircraft impairment  svso charge  and fuel were the primary causes of the basis point decline in operating margin to 
supply chain freight operations compared to supply chain freight revenue increased million  or  for the year

average ltl shipments per day decreased during the year  reflecting the weak ltl market in the united states in as compared with however  ltl revenue per hundredweight increased for the year  due to an increase in base rates in and an increase in fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher diesel prices 
the weak us ltl market declined further in the fourth quarter of  which led to a revenue decline of million  or  from the comparable quarter of fourth quarter average ltl shipments per day decreased  with ltl revenue per hundredweight declining  partially due to declining fuel surcharge rates 
in january  ups freight announced a general rate increase averaging covering non contractual shipments in the united states and canada 
the increase became effective on february   and applies to minimum charge  ltl and tl rates 
the other businesses within supply chain freight  which include our retail franchising business and our financial business  increased revenue by during the year 
this revenue growth was impacted by increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 
operating profit for the supply chain freight segment decreased by million for the year  primarily due to a million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter in the ups freight business unit  as discussed further in the operating expenses section 
operating profit improved in the forwarding and logistics business  primarily resulting from revenue management initiatives and a focus on asset utilization 
the change in operating profit was also positively affected by million in due to favorable currency exchange rates 

table of contents operating profit for this segment was negatively impacted in by million due to the svso charge and by million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain non core business units in france  as discussed further in the operating expenses section

compared to supply chain freight revenue increased million  or  in forwarding and logistics revenue increased million  or  for the year  and was affected by favorable exchange rate movements and revenue management initiatives begun in favorable exchange rate movements positively affected the growth in revenue by million during the year 
revenue growth in this business was driven by improvements in international air freight and mail services  which were impacted by overall market growth and lower customer turnover rates 
ups freight increased revenue million  or  for the year as a result of improved yields and a strong increase in average daily shipment volume 
average ltl shipments per day increased during the year  driven by new customer wins and leveraging our existing small package customer base for new sales opportunities 
ltl revenue per hundredweight increased during the year  due to an increase in base rates in and a focus on higher yielding customer segments 
the increase in revenue per hundredweight and average daily shipments were somewhat offset by a decrease for the year in the ltl weight per shipment 
the other businesses within supply chain freight  which include our retail franchising business  our financial business  and our us domestic cargo operations  increased revenue by during the year 
this revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the us postal service 
operating profit for the supply chain freight segment was million in  compared with a profit of million in  resulting in a basis point improvement in the operating margin 
this improvement was largely due to improved results in the forwarding and logistics business as a result of cost controls  a focus on asset utilization  and revenue management initiatives 
cost improvements were realized as a result of the restructuring program that began in  which included a reduction of non operating staff of approximately  people 
additionally  margin improvements are being realized by focusing on capacity utilization in the air freight business  through better utilizing space available on our own aircraft 
finally  revenue management initiatives put into place last year are producing better returns through reducing less profitable accounts  and ensuring that new accounts meet specific criteria that allow us to better utilize our existing transportation assets 
operating profit in for this segment was reduced by million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain non core business units in france  as well as by million due to the svso charge 
these charges are discussed further in the operating expenses section 
currency fluctuations positively affected the growth in operating profit by million in operating expenses compared to consolidated operating expenses decreased by billion  or  for the year  primarily due to a reduction in compensation and benefits expense 
currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain freight segments accounted for approximately million of increased operating expenses from to compensation and benefits expense decreased by billion  or  for the year  and was impacted by several items 
the primary reason for the decrease was a reduction in pension expense for our multiemployer pension plans  largely relating to a billion charge in to withdraw from the central states pension 
table of contents fund 
partially offsetting this was a million increase in expense for ups sponsored pension plans in the us  which was impacted by expense recognition now being required for the new ups ibt pension plan 
non pension benefits expense increased largely due to higher employee health and welfare program costs  which is impacted by medical cost inflation 
employee payroll costs increased due to contractual wage increases for our union employees and normal merit increases for our non union employees 
compensation and benefits expense also declined due to the absence in of the svso and france restructuring charges  which had increased compensation and benefits expense by and million in  respectively 
the increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased aircraft maintenance  somewhat offset by reduced vehicle maintenance expense 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors  including higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles resulting from new deliveries  but partially offset by reduced amortization expense on capitalized software resulting from a decrease in software development projects 
the increase in purchased transportation was driven by a combination of higher volume in our international package and forwarding businesses  the impact of currency exchange rates  and increased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by third party carriers 
the increase in fuel expense was impacted by higher prices for jet a fuel  diesel  and unleaded gasoline as well as lower hedging gains 
the increase in other occupancy expense was influenced by higher electricity and natural gas costs  as well as higher rent and property tax expense 
during the fourth quarter of  declining energy prices impacted costs such as purchased transportation  which decreased million  or  and fuel  which decreased million  or  compared with the fourth quarter of other expenses increased for the year primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 
in addition  we also experienced increased expenses for leased transportation equipment  data processing  advertising  professional services  and bad debts 
these factors were partially offset by the absence in of a million aircraft impairment charge recorded in we test our goodwill for impairment annually  as of october st  on a reporting unit basis in accordance with fasb statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
our reporting units are comprised of the europe  asia  and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment  and the forwarding logistics  ups freight  mbe ups store  and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain freight reporting segment 
the impairment test involves a two step process 
first  a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values  including goodwill  is performed 
we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model  and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies  as applicable 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit  which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in  had a goodwill impairment of million 
this impairment charge resulted from several factors  including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the ltl sector  and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar ltl industry participants 
at the time of acquisition of overnite corporation  ltl equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger 
we invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance  as well as expand service offerings 
however  this process took longer than initially anticipated  and thus financial results have been below our expectations 
additionally  the ltl sector in has been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the us  lower industrial production and retail sales  volatile fuel prices  and significant levels of price based competition 
by the fourth quarter of  the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit  leading to the goodwill impairment charge 
none of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in  nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in or 
table of contents as a result of weak performance in our domestic package operations in the united kingdom  we reviewed our long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment within our uk domestic package entity 
based on recent performance and near term projections  the value assigned to a customer list intangible asset acquired within the uk domestic package business was determined to be impaired 
this was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with an acquired business 
accordingly  an intangible asset impairment charge of million was recorded for the year ended december  compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by billion  or  in compared with currency fluctuations in our international package and supply chain freight segments resulted in consolidated operating expenses increasing by million for the year 
compensation and benefits expense increased by billion for the year  and was impacted by several items including the charge for the withdrawal from the central states pension fund  higher wage rates in the union workforce  increased stock based compensation  higher expense for union pension and welfare programs  the svso charge  and the restructuring charge in our supply chain freight business in france 
these increases were slightly offset by lower workers compensation expense 
our national master agreement with the teamsters allowed us  upon ratification  to withdraw employees from the central states pension fund and to establish a jointly trusteed single employer plan for this group ups ibt pension plan 
upon ratification of the contract in december and our withdrawal from the central states pension fund  we recorded a pre tax billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability  and made a december payment in the same amount to the central states pension fund to satisfy this liability 
the withdrawal liability was based on computations performed by independent actuaries employed by the central states pension fund  in accordance with the plan document and the applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
we negotiated our withdrawal from the central states pension fund as part of our national master agreement with the teamsters  which included other modifications to hourly wage rates  healthcare and pension benefits  and work rules 
we sought to negotiate our withdrawal from the central states pension fund  as we believed the fund would likely continue to have funding challenges  and would present a risk to ups of having to face higher future contribution requirements and a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those ups employees who participated in the fund 
we believe that we benefited financially from the ability to achieve a ratified national master agreement seven months before the expiration of the previous agreement  as well as by gaining better control over the future cost and funding of pension benefits by limiting our obligations solely to ups teamster employees through the new ups ibt pension plan 
as the ups ibt pension plan matures  we believe that it will become cost beneficial from a cash flow and earnings standpoint compared with having remained in the central states pension fund 
in december  we offered the svso to approximately employees who work in non operating functions 
this program was established to improve the efficiency of non operating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company 
the svso ended in february  and  or of eligible employees  accepted the offer 
as a result  we recorded a charge to expense of million in the first quarter of  to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the svso program 
in the third quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in france 
the objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the europe region 
the restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program  which was ratified by our company s trade union representatives in france in 
table of contents july employees participating in this program were entitled to severance benefits  including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase 
these severance benefits were formula driven and were in accordance with french statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million million related to severance costs  and thus recorded in compensation and benefits expense in related to this program 
stock based and other management incentive compensation expense increased million  or  during  primarily due to awards of stock options  restricted performance units  and restricted stock units 
pension and healthcare expense increased during the year  largely due to higher expense associated with plans covering union employees  but was somewhat offset by a million decrease in expense for the ups sponsored pension plans in the us the expense associated with our self insurance accruals for workers compensation claims  automotive liability and general business liabilities was million lower in compared with insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels  which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
the lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from several company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors  including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies  improved oversight and management of claims  improved trends in health care costs  and favorable state legislative reforms 
the increase in repairs and maintenance reflects higher maintenance expense on aircraft  largely offset by lower maintenance expense on vehicles and buildings 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors  including lower depreciation expense on aircraft and amortization expense on capitalized software  partially offset by increased depreciation expense on vehicles 
the increase in purchased transportation was impacted by volume growth in our international package business and currency fluctuations  as well as growth in our international forwarding business 
the increase in fuel expense for the year was primarily due to higher prices for jet and diesel fuel  as well as higher usage  but was partially mitigated by hedging gains 
other occupancy expense increased for the year  and was affected by increased rent expense and property taxes  but partially offset by lower utilities expense 
the increase in other expenses for the year was affected by a million aircraft impairment charge  discussed further below  but partially offset with cost controls in several areas 
the comparison in other expenses was also affected by an million charge to settle class action litigation in as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of  including capacity optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates  we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses 
the review was completed in march  and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing and aircraft  and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in this charge is included in the caption other expenses in the statement of consolidated income  of which million impacted our us domestic package segment and million impacted our international package segment 
investment income and interest expense compared to the decrease in investment income of million was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest earning investments  investment impairment charges  and a lower yield earned on our investments 
during  we recorded impairment losses on two auction rate securities that were collateralized by preferred stock issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
the impairment followed actions by the us treasury department and the federal housing 
table of contents finance agency with respect to fnma and fhlmc 
additionally  we recorded impairment losses on a municipal auction rate security and on holdings of several medium term notes issued by lehman brothers inc  which declared bankruptcy during we do not hold any other securities in any of these entities 
the total of these credit related impairment losses during was million  which was recorded in investment income on the income statement 
interest expense increased million in  primarily due to a higher average balance of outstanding debt 
in early  we completed the issuance of billion in long term debt  the proceeds of which were used to reduce our commercial paper balance 
our commercial paper balances had previously increased to fund the billion central states pension fund withdrawal payment in december the impact of increased debt balances was partially mitigated  however  by lower average rates incurred on our variable rate debt and interest rate swap agreements as a result of declines in short term interest rates in the united states throughout compared to the increase in investment income of million was primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of investments  but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest earning investments and increased equity method losses on investment partnerships 
interest expense increased million in  primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding  largely related to commercial paper 
our commercial paper balances increased in the fourth quarter of  causing a corresponding increase in interest expense  as a result of the payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund 
increased interest charges were somewhat offset  however  by higher capitalized interest related to various construction projects  including aircraft purchases and our worldport expansion 
income tax expense compared to income tax expense increased by billion in compared with  primarily due to higher pre tax income 
pre tax income in was adversely impacted by the central states withdrawal charge  as noted previously 
the effective tax rate was in  compared with in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to several factors resulting from the central states withdrawal charge in these factors included having proportionally lower tax credits in  and the effect of having a much higher proportion of our taxable income in being subject to tax in the united states  whereas a relatively greater proportion of taxable income in was subject to tax outside the united states  where effective tax rates are generally lower 
the effective tax rate in was also percentage points higher due to the lack of tax deductibility of the million goodwill and million intangible impairment charges discussed previously 
compared to income tax expense declined by billion in compared with  due to lower pre tax income primarily resulting from the central states pension fund withdrawal charge 
the effective tax rate was in and in during  our effective tax rate was reduced primarily due to proportionally higher tax credits and the effect of having a relatively larger proportion of our taxable income being earned in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
net income and earnings per share compared to net income for was billion  compared with the million achieved in  resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to in from in the increase in net income was largely due to the absence in of some of the previously discussed charges to expense in in  net 
table of contents income was negatively impacted by the after tax impact of the charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the central states pension fund billion  the charge related to the restructuring and disposal of certain logistics operations in france million  the aircraft impairment charge million  and svso charge million 
the combination of these four charges reduced diluted earnings per share by

the combination of these two charges reduced diluted earnings per share by 
net income during was also adversely impacted by the deteriorating worldwide economic situation  as previously discussed 
earnings per share was favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding shares as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program  as the total number of outstanding shares declined by during compared to net income for was million  a decrease from the billion achieved in  resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share to in from in this decrease in net income was largely due to the after tax billion charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the central states pension fund 
additionally  net income was adversely impacted by million as a result of the restructuring charge in our france supply chain freight business  million as a result of the aircraft impairment charge  and million as a result of the svso charge 
these items were partially offset by the improved results in our international package and supply chain freight segments 
the reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share were largely due to the pension withdrawal  aircraft impairment  france restructuring  and svso charges noted above 
these items reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by and in earnings per share was favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding shares as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program  as the total number of outstanding shares declined by during liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and billion in   and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows compared with was impacted by several items  including changes in pension fundings  tax payments and refunds  and rates for our delivery services 
in  operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the billion payment made to withdraw from the central states pension fund 
total contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans declined in compared with  even excluding the central states pension fund withdrawal payment 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  total multiemployer pension plan fundings decreased by million in compared with excluding the billion withdrawal charge in  largely due to the lack of contributions to the central states pension fund in subsequent to our withdrawal 
additionally  contributions to our company sponsored pension and postretirement plans declined by million in compared with  as we had no material minimum funding requirements in and we made no significant discretionary contributions to our plans 
as discussed further in the contractual commitments section  we do have minimum funding requirements in the next several years  primarily related to the ups ibt pension plan 
the increase in operating cash flow was also favorably impacted by the timing of tax refunds and estimated tax payments in both and in  we received an million us federal tax refund due to prior overpayments of our estimated tax liability  primarily resulting from the deductibility of the central states pension fund withdrawal payment for tax purposes 
additionally  the amount of us federal quarterly estimated 
table of contents income tax payments was lower in compared with  also primarily relating to the deductibility of the pension withdrawal payment 
as of december   we have received substantially all of the expected cash tax benefits resulting from the withdrawal payment 
changes in package volume and pricing affect operating cash flow 
as noted previously  we increased rates in our package delivery and ltl services at the end of additionally  in october  we announced a base rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on january  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground 
we also increased the base rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service 
other pricing changes included a increase in the residential surcharge  and an increase of in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 
these rate changes are customary  and are consistent with previous years rate increases 
additionally  we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and us origin international air services by reducing by the index used to determine the fuel surcharge 
the ups ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the us energy department s on highway diesel fuel price 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 
in october  ups freight announced a general rate increase averaging covering non contractual shipments in the united states and canada 
the increase took effect on january   and applies to minimum charge  ltl and tl rates 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was   and billion in   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in compared with was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities 
net purchases sales of marketable securities were   and million in   and  respectively 
the net sales of marketable securities in and were primarily used to fund our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans  as well as to repurchase shares 
capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities  as follows in millions buildings and facilities aircraft and parts vehicles information technology as described in the contractual commitments section below  we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft  vehicles  equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 
we fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations 
the reduction in capital expenditures was largely due to the timing of aircraft deliveries 
capital expenditures on buildings and facilities increased in  primarily resulting from our worldport hub expansion  as well as the expansion and new construction projects at other facilities in europe  canada  and china 
in the fourth quarter of  we opened our new international air hub in shanghai  china  and also began construction of our new intra asia air hub in shenzhen  china 
we had a net cash use of and million in and  respectively  and net cash generation of million in  due to originations  sales  and customer paydowns of finance receivables  primarily in our commercial lending  asset based lending  and leasing portfolios 

table of contents other investing activities reflected a cash outflow of million in as compared with a million outflow in and a million cash inflow in  and was impacted by cash settlements of derivative contracts used in our energy and currency hedging programs  the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing and boeing aircraft orders  and increases in restricted cash balances 
in  we entered into an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our self insurance obligations 
this agreement required us to provide million in cash collateral to the insurance carrier  which is classified as restricted cash within other non current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we received paid cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts of   and million during   and  respectively 
financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was   and billion in   and  respectively 
our primary uses of cash flows for financing activities are to repurchase shares  pay cash dividends  and make debt principal repayments 
we repaid debt principal  net of issuances  of million in  compared with net issuances of debt of billion in in  we increased our commercial paper borrowings to fund the billion withdrawal payment to the central states pension fund commercial paper increased billion at december  over december  upon ratification of our labor contract with the teamsters  as previously discussed 
in  we repaid most of this commercial paper with the proceeds from a billion senior notes offering  as well as the million us federal tax refund received 
in january  we completed an offering of billion of senior notes due january  million of senior notes due january  and billion of senior notes due january all of these notes pay interest semiannually  and allow for redemption of the notes by ups at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a make whole amount  plus accrued interest 
after pricing and underwriting discounts  we received a total of billion in cash proceeds from the offering 
concurrent with the issuance these notes  we settled certain derivatives that were designated as hedges of the notes offering  resulting in a cash outflow of million which is reported in other financing activities on the cash flow statement 
other than commercial paper  repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations  redemption of certain tranches of ups notes  and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain partnerships 
during  we called for the redemption of million of notes issued under our ups notes program  and the associated swaps on the notes were terminated 
we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non scheduled repayments of debt 
in january  we announced a new financial policy regarding our capital structure to enhance shareowner value 
we intend to manage our balance sheet to a target debt ratio of approximately funds from operations to total debt 
in connection with this policy  the board of directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authorization to billion 
share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases  open market purchases  or other such methods as we deem appropriate 
the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions 
unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our board  the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program 
during   and  we repurchased a total of   and million shares of class a and class b common stock for   and billion  respectively   and billion reported on the statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements 
our quarterly cash dividends declared were   and per share in   and  respectively 
additionally  in the board of directors approved an earlier payment schedule for the november dividend declaration  as in prior years this dividend was payable the following january 
as a result  a total of five dividend payments were made in this extra dividend payment  along with the higher quarterly 
table of contents dividend per share  resulted in an increase in total cash dividends paid to billion in from billion in and billion in the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on various factors  including our net income  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects  and other relevant factors 
we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends 
on february   our board declared a dividend of per share  which is payable on march  to shareowners of record on february  sources of credit we are authorized to borrow up to billion under our us commercial paper program 
we had billion outstanding under this program as of december   with an average interest rate of 
at december   we classified billion of our commercial paper as long term debt on our balance sheet  based on our intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis in the future 
we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion in a variety of currencies  however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of december  we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks 
one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at day libor plus basis points 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities 
in addition to these credit facilities  we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or long term debt securities 
as of december   our moody s and standard poor s s p short term credit ratings were p and a  respectively  and our moody s and s p long term credit ratings were aa and aa  respectively  with a stable outlook from both of these credit rating agencies 
our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers  however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants 
these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by the company  and limit the amount of sale leaseback transactions that the company may engage in  to of net tangible assets each 
as of december  and for all prior periods  we have satisfied these financial covenants 
as of december   of net tangible assets is equivalent to billion  however we have no qualifying sale leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding 
we do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 
guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements  including variable interest entities  which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 

table of contents contractual commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases  operating leases  debt obligations  purchase commitments  pension fundings  and certain other liabilities 
we intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations 
the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions year capital leases operating leases debt principal debt interest purchase commitments pension fundings other liabilities after total our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft 
capital leases  operating leases  and purchase commitments  as well as our debt principal obligations  are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt  in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december  the calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
for debt denominated in a foreign currency  the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 
purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  the largest of which are orders for aircraft  engines  and parts 
as of december   we maintain orders for boeing er freighters to be delivered between and  and five boeing f aircraft scheduled for delivery during and these aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth 
pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the ups ibt pension plan  which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the teamsters  as well as the ups retirement plan and the ups pension plan 
these plans are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of and the employee retirement income security act of  using discount rates  asset returns  and other assumptions appropriate for these plans 
to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections  the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 
as a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets  our us domestic pension plans experienced a negative return on assets of approximately in  however these losses did not trigger any minimum funding requirement for contributions in in the ups retirement plan or ups pension plan 
the amount of any minimum funding requirement  as applicable  for these plans could change significantly in future periods  depending on many factors  including future plan asset returns and discount rates 
a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets  and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns  could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements 
such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods 
the contractual payments due under the other liabilities column primarily includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships 
the table above does not include approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 
table of contents accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash 
in addition  although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with fin  we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities 
fin is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately billion issued in connection with routine business requirements 
we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances  and as of december   we had million of surety bonds written 
as of december   we had unfunded loan commitments totaling million associated with our financial business 
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures  such as commitments for aircraft purchases  for the foreseeable future

we have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously 
table of contents defend ourselves in these cases  and defendants motion to dismiss is pending for decision by the court 
these cases are at a preliminary stage and at this time  we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability  if any  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  most us state and local jurisdictions  and many non us jurisdictions 
as of december   we had substantially resolved all us federal income tax matters for tax years prior to in february and july  the internal revenue service irs completed its audit of the tax years through and tax years through  respectively  with only a limited number of issues that will be considered by the irs appeals office by the end of in late  the irs began the initial planning phase of the income tax audit for tax years through along with this audit for tax years through  the irs is currently examining non income based taxes  including employment and excise taxes on transportation of property by air and fuel purchases  which could lead to proposed assessments 
the irs has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time  and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment  however  we do not believe that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us state and local and non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years prior to  but certain us state and local matters are subject to ongoing litigation 
as of december   we had approximately  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters 
in september  we reached a new national master agreement with the teamsters  which was ratified in december the new agreement provides for wage increases as well as contributions to healthcare and pension plans  and most economic provisions of the new five year agreement took effect on august   with the exception of our withdrawal from the central states pension fund which occurred in we have approximately  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association  which becomes amendable at the end of our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which became amendable in november we began formal negotiations with teamsters local in october in addition  the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers approximately 
these agreements run through july  we participate in a number of trustee managed multi employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements 
several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans  including unfavorable investment performance  changes in demographics  and increased benefits to participants 
at this time  we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions  if any  or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans 
other matters we received grand jury subpoenas from the antitrust division of the doj regarding the doj s investigations into certain pricing practices in the air cargo industry in july  and into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in december in october and june  we received information requests from the european commission relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry 
we also received and responded to related information requests from competition authorities in other jurisdictions 
we are cooperating with these inquiries

this new standard requires new disclosures only  and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
these new disclosures will be required for us beginning in our form k for the year ending december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

table of contents contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
fas requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable 
at the time a contingency is identified  we consider all relevant facts as part of our fas evaluation 
we record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of fas these criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable 
events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability 
these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under fas  excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below  were not material to the company s financial position as of december  in addition  we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december   because a loss is not reasonably estimable 
goodwill and intangible impairment we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units 
our reporting units are comprised of the europe  asia  and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment  and the forwarding logistics  ups freight  mbe ups store  and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain freight reporting segment 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october st for each reporting unit 
the impairment test involves a two step process 
first  a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values  including goodwill  is performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model dcf model  and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies  as applicable 
the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows 
these assumptions include projections of future revenue  costs and working capital changes 
in addition  we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables  as required  in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions  and changes in our business strategy  government regulations  or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments 
we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods 
if impairment indicators are present in future periods  the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our ups freight reporting unit  which was formed through the acquisition of overnite corporation in  had a goodwill impairment of million 
this impairment charge resulted from several factors  including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the ltl sector  and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar ltl industry participants 
at the time of acquisition of overnite corporation  ltl equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger 
we invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance  as well as 
table of contents expand service offerings 
however  this process took longer than initially anticipated  and thus financial results have been below our expectations 
additionally  the ltl sector in has been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the us  lower industrial production and retail sales  volatile fuel prices  and significant levels of price based competition 
by the fourth quarter of  the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit  leading to the goodwill impairment charge 
none of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in  nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in or all of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finite lived intangibles  and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible 
if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on a dcf model 
as a result of weak performance in our domestic uk package operations  we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment within our uk domestic package entity 
based on recent performance and near term projections  the value assigned to a customer list intangible asset acquired within the uk domestic package business was determined to be impaired 
this was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with an acquired business 
accordingly  an intangible asset impairment charge of million was recorded for the year ended december  no other intangible asset impairments were recognized in  nor were any such impairments recognized in or self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  health and welfare  and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels  which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
workers compensation  automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle 
consequently  actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims 
a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim  including the length of time the claim remains open  trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation 
furthermore  claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections 
changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals 
all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees 
these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans  anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation 
actual results may differ from these estimates and  therefore  produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
pension and postretirement medical benefits as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than 
table of contents pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable  and represent our best estimates  based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
a basis point change in the assumed discount rate  expected return on assets  and health care cost trend rate for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases decreases on the company s costs and obligations for the year in millions basis point increase basis point decrease pension plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation return on assets effect on net periodic benefit cost postretirement medical plans discount rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation health care cost trend rate effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation fair value measurements in the normal course of business  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk  including derivatives  marketable securities  finance receivables  other investments  and debt 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value  principally derivatives  marketable securities  and certain other investments 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads  and yield curve volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange  and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices is presented in the market risk section of this report 
our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy in accordance with fas level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs are based on other observable market data  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable  such as interest rates and yield curves 
level inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions  and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability 

table of contents the following is a general description of the valuation methodologies used for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value  including the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy 
derivative contracts our foreign currency  interest rate  and energy derivatives are largely comprised of over the counter derivatives  which are primarily valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves  currency exchange rates  and commodity forward prices  and therefore are classified as level marketable securities marketable securities utilizing level inputs include active exchange traded equity securities and equity index funds  and most us government debt securities  as these securities all have quoted prices in active markets 
marketable securities utilizing level inputs include non auction rate asset backed securities  corporate bonds  and municipal bonds 
these securities are valued using market corroborated pricing  matrix pricing  or other models that utilize observable inputs such as yield curves 
we have classified our auction rate securities portfolio as utilizing level inputs  as their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities 
these valuations may be revised in future periods as market conditions evolve 
these securities were valued as of december  considering several factors  including the credit quality of the securities  the rate of interest received since the failed auctions began  the yields of securities similar to the underlying auction rate securities  and the input of broker dealers in these securities 
other investments financial assets and liabilities utilizing level inputs include our holdings in certain investment partnerships 
these partnership holdings do not have any quoted prices  nor can they be valued using inputs based on observable market data 
these investments are valued internally using a discounted cash flow model based on each partnership s financial statements and cash flow projections 
depreciation  residual value  and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
in accordance with the provisions of fas  we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows  or external appraisals  as applicable 
we review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in estimating cash flows  we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business 
adverse changes in these volume forecasts  or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections  could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand 
this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type  resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 
we continually monitor our aircraft fleet utilization in light of current and projected volume levels  aircraft fuel prices  and other factors 
changes in any of these factors  including a continuation of the rapid economic 
table of contents decline experienced in the second half of  could result in modifications to our current aircraft fleet plan 
such modifications could result in a reduction in the expected useful life of an aircraft type or in impairment losses related to the early retirement of particular aircraft 
as a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of  including capacity optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates  we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses 
the review was completed in march  and based on the results of our evaluation  we accelerated the planned retirement of certain boeing and aircraft  and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in during  we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our boeing  boeing  and airbus a fleets  and as a result of this evaluation  increased the depreciable lives from to years and reduced the residual values from to of original cost 
this change did not have a material effect on our results of operations 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction  tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
in the first quarter of  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  and related guidance see note in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
accounts receivable we utilize the reserve method for recognizing bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable 
this requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date 
these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience  adjusted for current conditions  trends in customer payment frequency  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations 
table of contents of risk 
continued deterioration in macro economic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was and million  respectively 
our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december    and was   and million  respectively 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict 
the words believes  expects  anticipates  we see  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements include statements regarding our intent  belief and current expectations about our strategic direction  prospects and future results 
we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of foreign exchange  interest rate  equity and commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves  and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline 
currently  the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes 
additionally  we use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices 
the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was an asset liability of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts  assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated several energy derivatives and received million in cash 
additionally  in the second quarter of  we terminated several energy derivatives and received million in cash 
these transactions are reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows 
as these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting  were designated as hedges  and maintained their effectiveness  the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges 
the hedges that were terminated in the fourth quarter of will be recognized in the income statement through the first quarter of foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of to months 
as of december  and  the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset liability of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis 
table of contents assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
interest rate risk as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have issued debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps  as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify  and the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances 
the net fair value of our interest rate swaps at december  and was a liability of and million  respectively 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
we have investments in debt and preferred equity securities including auction rate securities  as well as cash equivalent instruments  some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest 
the potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at december  and would be approximately and million  respectively 
additionally  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest 
the potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at december  and would be immaterial 
this interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk  and for certain of these securities  we utilize options to hedge this price risk 
at december  and  the fair value of such investments was and million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of such investments  assuming a change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges  would be approximately and million at december  and credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default
