item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of heritage commerce corp and its subsidiaries 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report 
executive summary this summary is intended to identify the most important matters on which management focuses when it evaluates the financial condition and performance of the company 
when evaluating financial condition and performance  management looks at certain key metrics and measures 
the company s evaluation includes an analysis including comparisons with peer group financial institutions and with its own performance objectives established in the internal planning process 
the primary activity of the company is commercial banking 
the company s operations are located entirely in the southern and eastern regions of the general san francisco bay area of california in the counties of santa clara  alameda and contra costa 
the largest city in this area is san jose and the company s market includes the headquarters of a number of technology based companies in the region known commonly as silicon valley 
the company s customers are primarily closely held businesses and professionals 
performance overview comparison of operating results to and includes the effects of acquiring diablo valley bank dvb on june  in the dvb transaction  the company acquired million of tangible assets  including million of net loans  and assumed million of deposits 
net income in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in net income in was million lower than net income of million 
net income per diluted common share was for  as compared to during and in the company s return on average assets was and its return on average equity was in  as compared to and  respectively for  and and  respectively in the company s return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible equity were and  respectively  for  compared to and  respectively  for  and and  respectively  for the following are major factors impacting the company s results of operations in recent years net income for was million compared to million in  an decrease 
the decrease in net income is primarily related to the company s significant increase in its provision for loan losses in compared to net interest income was relatively flat in compared to decreasing by  and increased by million  or  in from changes in net interest income were primarily due to a lower net interest margin  partially offset by an increase in the volume of average interest earning assets as a result of the merger with dvb and significant new loan production 
the growth in was largely driven by an increase in average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin for was  a decrease of basis points from for the net interest margin for was 
decreases in the net interest margin are primarily the result of the basis points decline in the federal funds rate from september  through december   which caused interest earning assets to reprice lower at a quicker rate than interest bearing liabilities 
the company s provision for loan losses in was million  compared to a credit provision for loan losses of  in  and a credit provision for loan losses of  in the significant increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to the million in loan growth for  and deterioration in the loan portfolio reflected in the increase in nonperforming loans primarily caused by the negative impacts of the current economic and real estate downturn 
as previously disclosed  during the second quarter of  the company fully provided for estimated losses of million on loans to one borrower and his related entities 
all of these loans were in default under their respective loan terms and have been placed on nonaccrual status 
of these loans  million was charged off in the fourth quarter of noninterest income decreased by in to million  compared to million in noninterest income decreased by in to million compared to million in the decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the company s strategic shift to retain  rather than sell  sba loan production  beginning in the third quarter of  which provides the company with higher interest income over time 
noninterest expense increased to million in  compared to million in and million in operating expenses increased in due to the full year impact of the acquisition of diablo valley bank on june   including an increase in amortization of intangible assets  the new office in walnut creek  the addition of experienced banking professionals  the write off of leasehold improvements in the third quarter of due to the consolidation of our two offices in los altos  higher regulatory assessments  and an increase in legal fees and oreo expense 
the efficiency ratio was in  compared to in  and in the efficiency ratio increased in primarily due to compression of the net interest margin  no sba loan sale gains  and higher noninterest expense 
the income tax benefit for was million  as compared to income tax expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the negative effective income tax rate for was due to reduced pre tax earnings 
the effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of is primarily the result of the company s investment in life insurance policies whose earnings are not subject to taxes  tax credits related to investments in low income housing limited partnerships and investments in tax free municipal securities and loans 
the effective tax rates in are lower compared to and because pre tax income decreased substantially while benefits from tax advantaged investments did not 
the following are important factors in understanding our current financial condition and liquidity position total assets increased million  or  to billion at the end of from billion at the end of  primarily due to increased loan production generated by additional relationship managers hired in and  as well as the opening of a new office in walnut creek  california 
total loans increased million  or  to billion at the end of compared to billion at the end of total deposits increased million  or  to billion at the end of from billion at the end of this increase was primarily due to a million increase in brokered deposits and a million increase in time deposits of  and over  partially offset by a million decrease in core deposits 
the company s noncore funding which consists of time deposits  and over  brokered deposits  securities under agreement to repurchase  notes payable  and other short term borrowings to total assets ratio was at december   compared to a year ago 
the company s loans to total deposits ratio was at december   compared to a year ago 
this increase was due in part to the increase in brokered deposits during primarily due to softening in the real estate market in the company s market area  which is expected to continue through  nonperforming assets increased by million in the company issued million in preferred stock and a common stock warrant to the us treasury as a participant in the tarp capital purchase program 
the consolidated company and heritage bank of commerce meet the regulatory definition of well capitalized at december  deposits the compositions and cost of the company s deposit base are important in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics 
the company s depositors are generally located in its primary market area 
depending on loan demand and other funding requirements  the company also obtains deposits from wholesale sources including deposit brokers 
the company had million in brokered deposits at december  the increase in brokered deposits of million from december  was primarily to fund increasing loan growth 
the company also seeks deposits from title insurance companies  escrow accounts and real estate exchange facilitators  which were million at december  the company has a policy to monitor all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help assure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to concentrations 
deposits at december  were billion compared to billion at december   an increase of 
the company has not experienced any increased demand outside its ordinary course of business from its customers to withdraw the deposits as a result of recent developments in the financial institution industry 
liquidity our liquidity position refers to our ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely fashion 
we believe that our liquidity position is more than sufficient to meet our operating expenses  borrowing needs and other obligations for as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in available borrowing capacity from various sources including the federal home loan bank fhlb  and federal funds facilities with several financial institutions 
lending our lending business originates primarily through our branch offices located in our primary market 
while the economy in our primary service area weakened in late and throughout  the company has experienced strong loan growth for most of during the last quarter of we experienced a modest slowing in loan growth on a relative basis 
commercial and commercial real estate loans increased from december   as a result of relationship manager additions over the past year  a new office in walnut creek  california  and opportunities created by recent consolidation in the local banking industry 
we will continue to use and improve existing products to expand market share in current locations 
total loans increased to billion for compared to billion at december  net interest income the management of interest income and expense is fundamental to the performance of the company 
net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the largest component of the company s total revenue 
management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets 
because of our focus on commercial lending to closely held businesses  the company will continue to have a high percentage of floating rate loans and other assets 
given the current volume  mix and repricing characteristics of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  we believe our interest rate spread is expected to increase in a rising rate environment  and decrease in a declining interest rate scenario 
the company  through its asset and liability policies and practices  seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the company to an excessive level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing  maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this is discussed in more detail under liquidity and asset liability management 
from september  through december   the board of governors of the federal reserve system reduced short term interest rates by basis points 
this decrease in short term rates immediately affected the rates applicable to the majority of the company s loans 
while the decrease in interest rates also lowered the cost of interest bearing deposits  which represents the company s primary funding source  these deposits tend to reprice more slowly than floating rate loans 
the average monthly prime rate during was  compared to in management of credit risk because of our focus on business banking  loans to single borrowing entities are often larger than would be found in a more consumer oriented bank with many smaller  more homogeneous loans 
the average size of our loan relationships makes the company more susceptible to larger losses 
as a result of this concentration of larger risks  the company has maintained an allowance for loan losses which is higher than might be indicated by its actual historic loss experience 
in setting the loan loss allowance  management takes into consideration many factors including loan growth  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  the general economic condition in the company s market area  and the impact on the industrial sectors the company services  as well as management s overall assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio and the lending staff and managers who service the portfolio 
a complete discussion of the management of credit risk appears under provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income while net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues  noninterest income is an important component 
prior to the third quarter of  a significant percentage of the company s noninterest income was associated with its sba lending activity  consisting of gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing retained 
however  beginning in the third quarter of  the company decided to change its strategy regarding its sba loan business 
the company now retains most of its sba production  which allows us to generate more interest income rather than noninterest income 
other sources of noninterest income include the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance and service charges on deposits 
noninterest income will continue to be affected by the company s strategic decision to retain rather than sell its loans 
noninterest expense management considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the company s performance 
over the last three years  the company has undertaken several initiatives to reduce its noninterest expense and improve efficiency 
nonetheless  operating expenses increased in due to the full year impact of the acquisition of diablo valley bank on june   the new office in walnut creek  the addition of experienced banking professionals  the write off of leasehold improvements in the third quarter of due to the consolidation of our two offices in los altos  higher regulatory assessments  and an increase in legal fees and oreo expense 
management monitors progress in reducing noninterest expense through review of the company s efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio increased in primarily due to compression of the company s net interest margin  a decrease in noninterest income  the increase in nonperforming assets and the increase in expenses 
capital management heritage commerce corp and heritage bank of commerce meet the regulatory definition of well capitalized at december  as part of its asset and liability process  the company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth  expected earnings  risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue 
our capital position has been considerably strengthened 
as of december   our total risk based capital ratio was  or million  more than the regulatory requirement for well capitalized banks 
our tier risk based capital ratio of and our tier leverage ratio of as of december  also significantly exceeded regulatory guidelines for well capitalized banks 
on november   the company issued  shares of series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of for million 
see item business us treasury troubled asset relief program 
the terms of the us treasury tarp capital purchase program could reduce investment returns to our shareholders by restricting dividends to common shareholders  diluting existing shareholders interests  and restricting capital management practices 
in july   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock through july  from august  through may   the company purchased  shares for a total of million to complete the repurchase plan 
starting in  the company initiated the payment of quarterly cash dividends 
the company paid cash dividends of million or per common share in representing of earnings 
on january   the company announced it will pay a per share quarterly cash dividend 
the dividend will be paid on march   to shareholders of record on february  the company reduced its quarterly dividend from paid in previous quarters in an effort to maintain its strong capital position for future growth 
the company also accrued  of dividends in on the preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program 
results of operations the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income  which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the second is noninterest income  which primarily consists of loan servicing fees  customer service charges and fees  and the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance 
the majority of the company s noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
net interest income and net interest margin the level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination  including growth in earning assets  yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volumes of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products that comprise the company s earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid 
the following distribution  rate and yield table presents for each of the past three years  the average amounts outstanding for the major categories of the company s balance sheet  the average interest rates earned or paid thereon  and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated 
average balances are based on daily averages

a substantial portion of the company s earning assets are variable rate loans that re price when the company s prime lending rate is changed  in contrast to a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re price 
this causes the company s balance sheet to be asset sensitive which means that  all else being equal  the company s net interest margin will be lower during periods when short term interest rates are falling and higher when rates are rising 
management anticipates that the company s net interest margin could experience some compression if short term interest rates continue to fall in the net interest margin decreased basis points to in from in net interest income increased million  or  for to million from million for  primarily due to higher loan volume in provision for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans 
the company sets aside an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the income statement as the provision for loan losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
the loan loss provision is determined by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current quarter s expense 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company s earnings 
the loan loss provision and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio  the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the company s market area 
for  the company had a provision for loan losses of million  compared to a credit provision for loan losses of  for and credit provision for loan losses of  for the significant increase in the provision for loan losses for was primarily due to million of estimated losses on loans to one borrower and his related entities in the second quarter  million in loan growth  and increasing risk in the loan portfolio reflected by an increase of million in nonperforming loans 
the company anticipates that it will continue to make significant provisions for loan losses over the next several quarters if the economy continues to weaken 
the company has filed a lawsuit to recover the million loan amount  accrued interest and costs from one borrower and his related entities 
the complaint also alleges that the securities in the account collateralizing a million secured loan may not be recoverable  and the company has named as an additional defendant  the securities firm that held the securities collateral account 
due to a substantial problem with the validity of the collateral for the majority of the debt and the bankruptcy filing of the borrower  the company does not expect a quick resolution to this issue 
the allowance for loan losses represented  and of total loans at december   and  respectively

noninterest income the following table sets forth the various components of the company s noninterest income noninterest income increase decrease increase decrease year ended december  versus versus amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands service charges and fees on deposit accounts servicing income increase in cash surrender value of life insurance gain on sale of sba loans gain on sale capital group loan portfolio n a other total historically  a significant percentage of the company s noninterest income has been associated with its sba lending activity  as gain on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing rights retained 
however  beginning in the third quarter of  the company changed its strategy regarding its sba loan business by retaining new sba production in lieu of selling the loans 
reflecting the strategic shift to retain sba loan production  there were no gains from sale of loans in and servicing income will continue to decline on a comparative basis 
the reduction in noninterest income should be offset in future years with higher interest income  as a result of retaining sba loan production 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts were higher during compared to  due to higher fees from accounts on analysis as a result of lower interest rates and fewer waived fees 
lower interest rates generally result in lower earnings credits and higher net fees for services provided to clients 
the decrease in noninterest income in compared to was primarily attributable to a million decrease in gain on sale of loans including sba and capital group loans 
the net gain on sale of sba loans was million for  compared to million for when the company sold its sba loan production in and  gains or losses on sba loans held for sale were recognized upon completion of the sale  based on the difference between the net sales proceeds and the relative fair value of the guaranteed portion of the loan sold compared to the relative fair value of the unguaranteed portion 
the servicing assets that resulted from the sale of sba loans  with servicing rights retained  are amortized over the expected term of the loans using a method approximating the interest method

full time equivalent employees were at december  and december  and at december  occupancy  furniture and equipment increased  in compared to the increase in was a result of the write off of leasehold improvements in the third quarter of due to the consolidation of our two offices in los altos and the full year impact of the acquisition of dvb and the opening of our walnut creek office in august professional fees increased  for  compared to  primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of dvb  and legal services related to our recovery efforts of million of defaulted loans from one borrower and his related entities 
amortization of intangible assets and other expense increased in primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of dvb 
other operating expenses increased in due to the full year impact of the acquisition of dvb  higher regulatory assessments  and an increase in oreo expense 
the fdic insurance assessment increased  in noninterest expense increased million  or  in compared to the increase in compensation expense was primarily due to the acquisition of diablo valley bank and the company hiring a number of experienced bankers during salary and severance benefits for former diablo valley bank employees totaled  up front costs associated with the hiring of new bankers for the east bay expansion and sba teams totaled  in income tax expense the company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis 
as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements  the effective tax rate is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income as adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
these permanent differences include  but are not limited to  tax exempt interest income  increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies  california enterprise zone deductions  certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions  and tax credits 
the company s federal and state income tax benefit in was million  as compared to income tax expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the negative effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was due to reduced pre tax earnings 
the effective income tax rates for the years ended and were and  respectively 
the difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of is primarily the result of the company s investment in life insurance policies whose earnings are not subject to taxes  tax credits related to investments in low income housing limited partnerships and investments in tax free municipal securities 
the effective tax rates in are lower compared to and because pre tax income decreased substantially while benefits from tax advantaged investments did not 
tax exempt interest income is generated primarily by the company s investments in state  county and municipal loans and securities  which provided  in federal tax exempt income in and  in and  in although not reflected in the investment portfolio  the company also has total investments of million in low income housing limited partnerships as of december  these investments have generated annual tax credits of approximately million in and and million in the investments are expected to generate an additional million in aggregate tax credits from through  however  the amount of the credits are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants and cannot be projected with certainty 
some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles  leading to timing differences between the company s actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary differences comprise the deferred portion of the company s tax expense  which is accumulated on the company s books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse 
at the end of  the company had a net deferred tax asset of million

the portfolio serves the following purposes i it can be readily reduced in size to provide liquidity for loan balance increases or deposit decreases  ii it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds  as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender  iii it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool  since it provides a large base of assets  the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  iv it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans  and v it can enhance the company s tax position by providing partially tax exempt income 
the company s securities are all currently classified under existing accounting rules as available for sale to allow flexibility for the management of the portfolio 
fasb statement requires available for sale securities to be marked to fair value with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
monthly adjustments are made to reflect changes in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
the company s portfolio is currently composed primarily of i us treasury securities and government sponsored entities debt securities for liquidity and pledging  ii mortgage backed securities  which in many instances can also be used for pledging  and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio  iii municipal obligations  which provide tax free income and limited pledging potential  and iv collateralized mortgage obligations  which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio

the loan portfolio mix over the past five years has remained relatively the same 
the company s commercial loans are made for working capital  financing the purchase of equipment or for other business purposes 
such loans include loans with maturities ranging from thirty days to one year and term loans  with maturities normally ranging from one to five years 
short term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments  with interest payable monthly 
term loans normally provide for floating interest rates  with monthly payments of both principal and interest 
the company s commercial loans are centered in locally oriented commercial activities in markets where the company has a physical presence  and these markets have become more competitive as business activity has moderated 
the company is an active participant in the small business administration sba and us department of agriculture guaranteed lending programs  and has been approved by the sba as a lender under the preferred lender program 
the company regularly makes sba guaranteed loans 
prior to third quarter of  the guaranteed portion of these loans were sold in the secondary market depending on market conditions 
once it was determined that these loans would be sold  the loans were classified as held for sale and carried at the lower of cost or market 
when the guaranteed portion of an sba loan was sold  the company retained the servicing rights for the sold portion 
as of december    and  million  million and million  respectively  in sba and us department of agriculture loans were serviced by the company for others 
as previously discussed  beginning in the third quarter of  the company changed its strategy regarding its sba loan business by retaining new sba production in lieu of selling the loans 
as of december   real estate mortgage loans of million consist primarily of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by deeds of trust on commercial property 
properties securing the commercial real estate mortgage loans are primarily located in the company s market  which is the greater san francisco bay area 
real estate values in the greater san francisco bay area have declined significantly in the residential market in  compared to other areas in california and the us have experienced even greater declines 
while the commercial real estate market has not seen the same level of declines as the residential market in the greater san francisco bay area  it has started to decline 
the company s borrowers will be impacted by a further downturn in these sectors of the economy  which could adversely impact the borrowers ability to repay their loans and reduce demand for loans 
based on the general economic conditions  we anticipate our borrowers will continue to be affected in the company s real estate term loans consist primarily of loans made based on the borrower s cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment 
the company generally restricts real estate term loans to no more than of the property s appraised value or the purchase price of the property during the initial underwriting of the credit  depending on the type of property and its utilization 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans 
maturities on such loans are generally between five and ten years with amortization ranging from fifteen to twenty five years and a balloon payment due at maturity  however  sba and certain other real estate loans that can be sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities 
the company s land and construction loans are primarily short term interim loans to finance the development construction of commercial and single family residential properties 
the company utilizes underwriting guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan 
the company makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles  various types of consumer goods  and other personal purposes 
additionally  the company makes home equity lines of credit available to its clientele 
consumer loans generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest 
most of the company s consumer loans are secured by the personal property being purchased or  in the instances of home equity loans or lines  real property 
with certain exceptions  state chartered banks are permitted to make extensions of credit to any one borrowing entity up to of the bank s capital and reserves for unsecured loans and up to of the bank s capital and reserves for secured loans 
for hbc  these lending limits were million and million at december   respectively 
loan maturities the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans as of december  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined fixed interest rates and those with variable floating interest rates 
floating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the prime rate as reflected in the western edition of the wall street journal 
as of december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio consisted of floating interest rate loans 
loan maturities over one due in year but one year less than over or less five years five years total dollars in thousands commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer loans loans with variable interest rates loans with fixed interest rates loans nonperforming assets financial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk  and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay 
since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company s management of credit quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts  and or as a result of the downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values 
in addition  certain debt securities that the company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor s financial capacity to repay deteriorates 
to help minimize credit quality concerns  we have established a sound approach to credit that includes well defined goals and objectives and well documented credit policies and procedures 
the policies and procedures identify market segments  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company s underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
the company s internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with loan customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio 
the company s credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values  and trends in particular industries or geographic markets 
as a multi community independent bank serving a specific geographic area  the company must contend with the unpredictable changes of both the general california and  particularly  primary local markets 
the company s asset quality has suffered in the past from the impact of national and regional economic recessions  consumer bankruptcies  and depressed real estate values 
nonperforming assets are comprised of the following loans for which the company is no longer accruing interest  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest although they are generally placed on non accrual when they become days past due  unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection  loans restructured where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a deferral of interest or principal  and other real estate owned oreo from foreclosures 
management s classification of a loan as non accrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan 
at that point  the company stops accruing interest income  reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued as income  and begins recognizing interest income only as cash interest payments are received as long as the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt 
the loans may or may not be collateralized  and collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full restitution 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale 
the following table provides information with respect to components of the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans loans days past due and still accruing total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans plus other real estate owned primarily due to the general economic slowdown and a softening in the real estate market  which is expected to continue well into  nonperforming assets at december  increased million from december  levels 
the increase in nonperforming assets in was primarily in land and construction loans and commercial loans 
nonperforming assets increased by million  or  in as compared to allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the impaired loan balance and value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market 
management conducts a critical evaluation of the loan portfolio at least quarterly 
this evaluation includes periodic loan by loan review for certain loans to evaluate the level of impairment  as well as reviews of other loans either individually or in pools based on an assessment of the following factors past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  size and complexity of the loans  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  bank regulatory examination and independent loan review results  and current economic conditions in the company s marketplace  in particular the state of the technology industry and the real estate market 
this process attempts to assess the risk of loss inherent in the portfolio by segregating loans into the following categories for purposes of determining an appropriate level of the allowance loans graded pass through special mention  substandard  and substandard non accrual  doubtful and loss 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the uncollectibility of the loan balance is confirmed 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance and specific allowances 
specific allowances are established for impaired loans 
management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the note agreement 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell  or on the present value of expected future cash flows 
the formula portion of the allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to pools of outstanding loans 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience  adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the adjustment factors for the formula allowance may include existing general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  in particular the real estate market  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  the technology industry and specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  and bank regulatory examination results 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty 
loans that demonstrate a weakness  for which there is a possibility of loss if the weakness is not corrected  are categorized as classified 
classified loans include all loans considered as substandard  substandard non accrual  doubtful  and loss and may result from problems specific to a borrower s business or from economic downturns that affect the borrower s ability to repay or that cause a decline in the value of the underlying collateral particularly real estate 
the principal balance of classified loans was million  million  and million  at december    and  respectively 
ninety six percent of the classified loans at december  were internally graded as substandard or substandard non accrual 
all classified loans at year end and were graded substandard or substandard non accrual 
the million increase in classified loans during consists of million in land and construction loans  million in commercial loans  million in commercial real estate loans  million loans to one borrower and his related entities  and million in other loans 
with a continuing downturn in the economic environment  the level of classified loans will continue to feel pressure 
in adjusting the historical loss factors applied to the respective segments of the loan portfolio  management considered the following factors levels and trends in delinquencies  non accruals  charge offs and recoveries trends in volume and loan terms lending policy or procedural changes experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff national and local economic trends and conditions concentrations of credit there can be no assurance that the adverse impact of any of these conditions on hbc will not be in excess of the current level of estimated losses 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
on an ongoing basis  we have engaged outside firms to independently assess our methodology and perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio 
the company s credit review consultants  the frb  fdic and the dfi also review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of the examination process 
based on information currently available to analyze loan loss delinquency and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the loan loss allowance is adequate 
however  the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company s market area were to continue to weaken 
also  any weakness of a prolonged nature in the technology industry would have a negative impact on the local market 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased loan losses  which could adversely affect the company s future growth and profitability 
no assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty 
the following table summarizes the company s loan loss experience  as well as provisions and charges to the allowance for loan losses and certain pertinent ratios for the periods indicated allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year charge offs commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer total recoveries net recoveries charge offs provision for loan losses reclassification of allowance for loan losses reclassification to other liabilities allowance acquired in bank acquisition balance  end of year ratios net charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans average loans and total loans exclude loans held for sale the company reclassified million of the allowance allocated to million of commercial asset based loans that were reclassified to loans held for sale as of december  thus  the carrying value of these loans held for sale includes an allowance for loan losses of million 
the company reclassified estimated losses on unused commitments of million to other liabilities as of december  the company s allowance for loan losses increased million in the increase in the provision for loan losses in was primarily due to million of estimated losses on loans to one borrower and his related entities in the second quarter  million in loan growth  and additional risk in the loan portfolio reflected in an increase of million in nonperforming loans from the company had million in charge offs in  which were nominally offset by loan by recoveries of  net loans charged off reflects the realization of losses in the portfolio that were recognized previously through provisions for loan losses 
net charge offs were million in  compared to net recoveries of million in  and net charge off of million in historical net loan charge offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge offs that the company will realize in the future 
the company s unallocated allowance was million as of december  and the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amount available for charge offs that may occur within these categories

our net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits can be concentrated in historically lower cost deposits such as non interest bearing demand accounts  now accounts  savings accounts and money market deposit accounts 
the company s liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or  in other words  by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in california  and the company s market area in particular  continue to weaken 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit  meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed  as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate sensitive than customers with smaller balances

the company s business is not generally seasonal in nature 
the company is not dependent upon funds from sources outside the united states 
at december  and  less than and of deposits were from public sources  respectively 
the decreases in savings and money market deposits were primarily due to lower balances in title insurance company  escrow  and real estate exchange facilitators accounts

as a result  certain types of business clients that the company serves typically carry average deposits in excess of  the account activity for some account types and client types necessitates appropriate liquidity management practices by the company to ensure its ability to fund deposit withdrawals 
return on equity and assets the following table indicates the ratios for return on average assets and average equity  dividend payout  and average equity to average assets for and return on average assets return on average tangible assets return on average equity return on average tangible equity dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets ratio percentage is calculated based on dividends paid divided by net income available to common shareholders 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in contractual arrangements 
these commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the company  yet are not reflected in any form within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
total unused commitments to extend credit were million at december   as compared to million at december  unused commitments represented and of outstanding gross loans at december  and  respectively 
the effect on the company s revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted  because there is no certainty that the lines of credit will ever be fully utilized 
for more information regarding the company s off balance sheet arrangements  see note to the financial statements located elsewhere herein 
the following table presents the company s commitments to extend credit as of december    and december  dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit contractual obligations the contractual obligations of the company  summarized by type of obligation and contractual maturity  at december  are as follows less than one to three to after one year three years five years five years total dollars in thousands securities sold under agreement to repurchase notes payable to subsidiary grantor trusts other short term borrowings note payable   operating leases time deposits of or more total debt and operating leases in addition to those obligations listed above  in the normal course of business  the company will make cash distributions for the payment of interest on interest bearing deposit accounts and debt obligations  payments for quarterly income tax estimates and contributions to certain employee benefit plans 
liquidity and asset liability management liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
an integral part of the company s ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the company s large base of core deposits  which are generated by offering traditional banking services in its service area and which have  historically  been a stable source of funds 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages liquidity to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of balance sheet liquidity 
excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the company s interest margin 
in order to meet short term liquidity needs  the company utilizes overnight federal funds purchase arrangements with correspondent banks  borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks  solicits brokered deposits if cost effective deposits are not available from local sources and maintains a collateralized line of credit with the federal home loan bank the fhlb of san francisco 
in addition  the company can raise cash for temporary needs by selling securities under agreements to repurchase and selling securities available for sale 
during  the company experienced a tightening in its liquidity position as a result of the significant loan growth 
in order to partially fund the loan growth  the company added brokered deposits of million during fhlb borrowings available lines of credit the company has off balance sheet liquidity in the form of federal funds purchase arrangements with correspondent banks  including the fhlb 
the company can borrow from the fhlb on a short term typically overnight or long term over one year basis 
at december   the company had million of overnight borrowings from the fhlb  bearing interest at 
there were million in fhlb advances at december   bearing interest at 
the company had million of loans pledged to the fhlb as collateral on an available line of credit of million at december  at december   hbc had federal funds purchase arrangements available of million 
there were no federal funds purchased at december  or the company also had a million line of credit with a correspondent bank  all of which was outstanding as of december  the company repaid the line of credit in march securities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured by mortgage backed securities carried at approximately million at december  the repurchase agreements were million at december  the following table summarizes the company s borrowings under its federal funds purchased  security repurchase arrangements and lines of credit for the periods indicated december  dollars in thousands average balance during the year average interest rate during the year maximum month end balance average rate at december  because most of the growth in loans in was funded with deposits  other liquidity ratios tracked by the company  such as unfunded loan commitments to secondary reserves ratio  have been slightly outside of policy guidelines for several months 
we continue to watch these ratios closely  and expect that these ratios will revert back within guidelines 
capital resources at december   the company had total shareholders equity of million  including million in preferred stock  and million of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million  or per common share in on january   the company announced it will pay a per share quarterly cash dividend 
the dividend will be paid on march   to shareholders of record on february  the company reduced its quarterly dividend from in an effort to maintain its strong capital position for future growth 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy 
management reviews various capital measurements on a regular basis and takes appropriate action to help ensure that such measurements are within established internal and external guidelines 
the external guidelines  which are issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic  establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the federal reserve board and fdic guidelines tier and tier capital 
our tier capital consists of shareholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss and the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities  less goodwill and other intangible assets 
our tier capital includes the allowances for loan losses and off balance sheet credit losses  subject to certain limits

mandatory redeemable cumulative trust preferred securities 
to enhance regulatory capital and to provide liquidity  the company  through unconsolidated subsidiary grantor trusts  issued the following mandatory redeemable cumulative trust preferred securities of subsidiary grantor trusts in the first quarter of  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures due on march  to a subsidiary trust  which in turn issued a similar amount of trust preferred securities 
in the third quarter of  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures due on september  to a subsidiary trust  which in turn issued a similar amount of trust preferred securities

market risk market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings  fair values  or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including securities  loans  deposits and borrowings  as well as the company s role as a financial intermediary in customer related transactions 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company s earnings and equity to loss and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain financial instruments 
interest rate management market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments  nor does the company have exposure to currency exchange rates 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and manage the risks 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i a standard gap analysis  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution s net interest margin 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  the net interest margin may change over time 
even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of loans or securities or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities 
the company has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities  which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company uses modeling software for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company s net interest margin  and to calculate the estimated fair values of the company s financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the program imports current balances  interest rates  maturity dates and repricing information for individual financial instruments  and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for new volumes to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the company s interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company s investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and parallel change in all base rates  up or down  ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  based on current trends and econometric models or economic conditions stable unchanged from current actual levels 
the company applies a market value mv methodology to gauge its interest rate risk exposure as derived from its simulation model 
generally  mv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other investments and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the mv which would result from a theoretical basis point basis point equals change in market interest rates 
both a basis point increase and a basis point decrease in market rates are considered 
at december   it was estimated that the company s mv would increase in the event of a basis point increase in market interest rates 
the company s mv at the same date would decrease in the event of a basis point decrease in applicable interest rates 
presented below  as of december  and  is an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by changes in mv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points in market interest rates change change market value as a of change change market value as a of in market in market present value of assets in market in market present value of assets value value mv ratio change bp value value mv ratio change bp dollars in thousands change in rates bp bp bp management believes that the mv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows 
second  because the mv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an institution s interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
however  as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the mv methodology 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historic rate patterns  which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react in the same way to changes in rates 
in reality  certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates  while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the mv methodology does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan clients ability to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
critical accounting policies general the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in certain instances  we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities 
a change in the discount factor or prepayment speeds could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
the company adopted fasb statement revised on january   and elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method  although the economics of our transactions would be the same 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses in our loan portfolio 
our accounting for estimated loan losses was previously discussed under the heading allowance for loan losses 
loan sales and servicing the amounts of gains recorded on sales of loans and the initial recording of servicing assets and i o strips are based on the estimated fair values of the respective components 
in recording the initial value of the servicing assets and the fair value of the i o strips receivable  the company uses estimates which are made on management s expectations of future prepayment and discount rates as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we grant stock options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under the plan 
we also granted our chief executive officer restricted stock when he joined the company 
additionally  we have outstanding options that were granted under an option plan from which we no longer make grants 
the benefits provided under all of these plans are subject to the provisions of fasb statement revised  share based payments 
our results of operations for fiscal   and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our share based compensation awards as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price  as well as the input of other subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected term of stock options and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
statement r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur 
our accounting for stock options is disclosed primarily in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the company accounts for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
management utilizes various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses to determine these fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to the acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets are evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as changes in economic or market conditions  indicate that impairment may exist 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management 
if the fair value of the reporting unit including goodwill is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  a further test is required to measure the amount of impairment 
if an impairment loss exists  the carrying amount of the goodwill is adjusted to a new cost basis 
for purposes of the goodwill impairment test  the valuation of the company is based on a weighted blend of the income method discounted cash flows  market approach considering key pricing multiples of similar control transactions  and market price analysis of the company s stock 
management believes the multiples and other assumptions used in these calculations are consistent with current industry practice for valuing similar types of companies 
goodwill was tested for impairment as of november  and with the assistance of a valuation firm 
intangible assets consist of core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets arising from the acquisition of diablo valley bank in these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment testing of these assets is performed at the individual asset level 
impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value at the date of the impairment test 
for intangible assets  estimates of expected future cash flows cash inflows less cash outflows that are directly associated with an intangible asset are used to determine the fair value of that asset 
management makes certain estimates and assumptions in determining the expected future cash flows from core deposit and customer relationship intangibles including account attrition  expected lives  discount rates  interest rates  servicing costs and other factors 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact the valuation of these intangible assets 
if an impairment loss exists  the carrying amount of the intangible asset is adjusted to a new cost basis 
the new cost basis is then amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of the company s operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
as of december   the company does not use interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk 
the information concerning quantitative and qualitative disclosure or market risk called for by item of regulation s k is included as part of item of this report
