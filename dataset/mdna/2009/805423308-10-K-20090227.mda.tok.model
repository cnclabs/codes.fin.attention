our strategic approach combines the use of virtualization technology  a utility services model  and automated software management and provisioning systems 
our solutions enable customers to focus on their core business while we ensure the quality of their it infrastructure 
for further information on our business and services  please refer to part i  item i of this annual report on form k 
business trends and outlook the increasingly difficult global economic environment remains our highest concern as we continue to monitor the impact that the economic downturn may have on our customers  particularly those customers in the financial services industry 
approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  was generated by customers in the financial sector 
given the current economic environment and uncertainty in the financial services industry  we remain cautious regarding these customers and their future impact on our revenue and profitability 
recently  one such financial services customer  american stock exchange  which accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   announced the completion of its merger with another company 
this merger was unrelated to the current credit crisis  however  we believe the merged entity may cancel its contract with us  which would result in a decrease in revenue in the future 
the economic situation has also reduced our visibility into the timing of new business closure 
sales cycles for new managed hosting business have lengthened as a result of customer cost pressures  and the visibility into the enterprise decision making cycle and timing has deteriorated due to tightening it budgets 
while these are big challenges  we believe we have considerable opportunity 
we believe that companies will increasingly consider moves to outsourced it solutions  as the internal pressure to control their infrastructure spending collides with increasing demands from their user community 
this situation is difficult for our customers and poses risk for us  however  we believe we are well positioned for this new environment 
our services model enables our enterprise customers to choose from a number of different strategies to reduce their it costs 
our focus is to provide mission critical  non discretionary it infrastructure outsourcing and we are specialists in managing servers  storage  virtualization  security and network infrastructure 
this means we can take away the context so businesses can focus on their core business 
with the completion of our global data center expansion  we believe we have the right footprint and functionality in place to provide our customers with what they need  where they need it 
more and more customers are looking for options like our new and innovative service offerings  such as software as a service  or saas  and our proximity hosting solutions 
the center point of our strategy is to provide a scalable managed hosting solution 
colocation and network services play an important and foundational role  however we remain intently focused on growing our managed hosting business 
the colocation market has grown and the prices have remained stable  and we are pleased with the progress we have made in that business 
colocation has now become an accepted first step in embracing it outsourcing solutions 
our network business will continue to be under pressure in  but we are seeing more demand for an integrated managed hosting and managed network solution  particularly in hosted applications requiring higher network performance 
this can be provided by our application transport network 
colocation and network services both require significant capital to sustain growth and  unlike managed hosting  these markets lack the barriers to entry and the high switching costs needed to maintain pricing power 
we believe the intersection of colocation  network and managed hosting allows us to produce a much higher return on invested capital than colocation alone  particularly leveraging technologies for shared platform resources 
we will continue to wrap colocation and network into our it infrastructure solutions as we build our managed hosting business going forward 

table of contents our focus in is on our customers  and aiming to offer them the solutions they need to better manage the current and future costs associated with their it infrastructure 
we are looking forward to developing and leading the market for hosting saas offerings from independent software vendors and expanding our existing virtualization and utility computing solutions 
we plan to leverage our compelling opportunities in proximity hosting to penetrate and lead the market for hosting applications in financial markets 
we believe our ability to offer our trading community a portfolio of managed hosting services  such as compute  storage  virtualization and managed network incorporating market data differentiates us from our competitors 
based on current economic conditions and demand for our services  we also will continue to remain focused on initiatives that we believe will continue to improve the health of our growing business  including increasing the quality of our infrastructure and the reliability of our services and client satisfaction through additional investments in systems and in customer satisfaction surveys  improving the efficiencies in our services and support and general and administrative areas through process improvement and increasing overall productivity  and exploring strategic options for those services that have experienced relatively slow growth in the past in order to allow us to focus on our high growth services

as of and during the year ended december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the debt agreements 
commitments and contingencies our customer contracts generally span multiple periods  which result in us entering into arrangements with various suppliers of communications services that require us to maintain minimum spending levels  some of which increase over time  to secure favorable pricing terms

there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from recurring revenue streams  consisting primarily of hosting services  which includes managed hosting and colocation  and network services  which is recognized as services are provided 
installation fees  although generally billed upon installation  are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the customer contract 
revenue is recognized when the related service has been provided  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in addition  we have service level commitments pursuant to individual customer contracts with a majority of our customers 
to the extent that such service levels are not achieved  or are otherwise disputed due to third party power or service issues  unfavorable weather  or other service interruptions or conditions  we estimate the amount of credits to be issued and record a reduction to revenue  with a corresponding increase in the allowance for credits and uncollectibles 
in the event that we provide credits or payments to customers related to service level claims  we may request recovery of such costs through third party insurance agreements 
insurance proceeds received under these agreements are recorded as an offset to previously recorded revenue reductions 
allowance for credits and uncollectibles as described in our policy on revenue recognition  we have service level commitments pursuant to individual customer contracts with the majority of our customers 
to the extent that such service levels are not achieved  we estimate the amount of credits to be issued  based on historical credits issued and known disputes  and record a reduction to revenue  with a corresponding increase in the allowance for credits and uncollectibles 
we assess collectibility of accounts receivable based on a number of factors  including customer payment history and creditworthiness 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers although in certain cases we may obtain a security deposit 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectibles when evaluating the adequacy of allowances  and we specifically analyze accounts receivable  current economic conditions and trends  historical bad debt write offs  customer concentrations  customer payment history and creditworthiness  and changes in customer payment terms 
delinquent account balances are charged to expense after we have determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 

table of contents equity based compensation we recognize equity based compensation in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
the fair value of total equity based compensation for stock options and restricted preferred units is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  which utilizes certain assumptions and estimates that have a material impact on the amount of total compensation cost recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
for stock options  an additional assumption is made on the number of awards expected to forfeit prior to vesting  which decreases the amount of total expense recognized 
this assumption is evaluated and the estimate is revised on a quarterly or as needed basis 
total equity based compensation costs for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are calculated based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
total equity based compensation is amortized to non cash equity based compensation expense over the vesting or performance period of the award  as applicable  which typically ranges from three to four years 
other critical accounting estimates while all of the significant accounting policies described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are important  some of these policies may be viewed as being critical 
such policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and require our most difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions

recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued staff position fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this fsp changes the accounting for our convertible notes 
under the new rule  for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion  an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments to reflect the issuer s economic interest cost 
this will require the reclassification of approximately million from long term debt to additional paid in capital  which will be treated as original issue discount of the convertible notes 
higher interest expense will result by recognizing the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of the convertible notes 
the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and requires retrospective application to all periods presented 
while the fsp does not change the economic substance or cash flow requirements of the convertible notes  our interest expense will increase by approximately million per year
