item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
manufacturing recothrom also referred to as rthrombin in preparation for the recothrom launch in the united states  we established a commercial supply chain  which relies on single source vendors 
we have entered into a long term manufacturing agreement with abbott laboratories for commercial scale production of recombinant thrombin rthrombin  the bulk active drug substance in recothrom 
under the agreement  abbott manufactures rthrombin using mammalian cells  according to specifications developed and agreed upon by both companies 
abbott has committed to supply each year up to a maximum amount  which we believe is sufficient to meet our projected market demand and provide adequate safety stock 
the agreement will terminate in to obtain raw material for manufacture of rthrombin bulk drug substance  we have entered into long term supply agreements with the supplier of snake 
table of contents protein and the manufacturer of immobilized prothrombin activator pta  which is used to activate prethrombin  the precursor for rthrombin 
we have also entered into a long term manufacturing services agreement with patheon  inc for fill and finish of rthrombin 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with anderson packaging  inc  a division of amerisourcebergen corp  as our secondary packaging vendor and cardinal health sps  inc as our third party logistics and distribution partner 
under the terms of a license and collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag  we will supply vials of rthrombin for up to five years from june   the effective date of the agreement 
thereafter  we will supply rthrombin bulk drug substance throughout the term of the license and collaboration agreement 
il our initial clinical supply of il  which is made in e 
coli  was manufactured by avecia limited using a process developed at zymogenetics 
subsequently  novo nordisk manufactured clinical materials for phase and initial phase development under a manufacturing agreement established in in january  novo nordisk terminated the agreement  but we acquired all rights to the manufacturing processes and product already manufactured 
other we have established internal manufacturing capabilities to supply various products for toxicology studies and early stage clinical trials 
we intend to transfer manufacturing to a collaborative partner or third party contractor for late stage clinical and commercial production runs 
our pilot scale gmp manufacturing facility gives us the capability to manufacture products using bacterial and mammalian cell production systems 
in  we continued production of peg ifn l clinical supplies  using a high yield internally developed e 
coli process 
we believe that we have produced sufficient supplies of peg ifn l to support clinical development though phase bristol myers squibb will be responsible for all future manufacturing of peg ifn l  including product for phase clinical trials and commercial sale  under the terms of our co development and co promotion agreement 
we also plan to use our internal facility to produce our antibody and antibody like product candidates  which are manufactured using mammalian cell culture recombinant technology 
our first antibody product candidate il mab is currently being manufactured in this facility 
collaborative relationships bayer license and collaboration agreement for rthrombin and us co promotion agreement for recothrom in june  we executed a license and collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag and a us co promotion agreement with bayer healthcare llc 
pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement  bayer schering pharma will develop and commercialize the initial presentations of rthrombin outside the united states 
pursuant to the co promotion agreement  bayer healthcare will contribute sales people and medical science liaisons for the first three years following the launch of recothrom in the united states 
depending on the level of sales in the first two years  bayer may have an option to extend the co promotion agreement for one additional year 
in addition  the license and collaboration agreement includes provisions through which the two companies may collaborate to develop subsequent presentations or line extensions of rthrombin  which we will commercialize within the united states and bayer will commercialize outside the united states 
as part of these agreements  bayer receives development and commercialization rights to rthrombin outside the united states 
a tiered commission of up to on recothrom sales in the united states during a three year co promotion period  which may be extended by one additional year at bayer s option 
for two years following the end of the co promotion period  a sales commission will be paid at a reduced rate  subject to an annual maximum 

table of contents up to million in sales bonus payments upon achievement of certain sales levels of recothrom in the united states 
an option to co develop or opt into our development of new presentations or line extensions of rthrombin and commercialize them outside the united states 
in return  we received a million upfront payment 
a million milestone payment upon the approval of recothrom in the united states 
million in milestone payments upon the submission of recothrom approval applications to the emea and canada 
in addition  we may receive up to approximately million in additional development and sales based milestone payments based on bayer schering pharma s development and sales of rthrombin products outside the united states 
tiered royalties based on annual sales of rthrombin products outside the united states 
under the license and collaboration agreement  each party is free to research and develop new presentations or line extensions of rthrombin provided that it proposes the new presentation to the other party within a specified period prior to filing an ind for the new presentation 
the other party may then opt to co develop and commercialize the new presentation by co funding the past and future development cost provided that the cost of certain territory specific activities is not shared 
the co development activities would be governed by a steering committee with equal representation from the two companies 
within the united states  we would have exclusive commercial rights to any new presentation that we co developed with bayer schering pharma or which we proposed and bayer schering pharma declined to co develop 
however  we would have no rights to any new presentation proposed by bayer schering pharma that we declined to co develop 
outside the united states  bayer schering pharma would have exclusive commercial rights to any new presentation that it co developed with us or which it proposed and we declined to co develop  and would pay us a royalty on product sales 
there is an opt in right wherein the declining party can opt in at a later time by paying a premium to the developing party 
under no circumstances may we commercialize a presentation of rthrombin outside the united states nor  except for the role of bayer healthcare under the co promotion agreement  may bayer schering pharma commercialize a presentation of rthrombin within the united states 
bristol myers squibb co development and co promotion agreement for peg ifn l in january  we entered into a co development co promotion and license agreement with bristol myers squibb company focused on product candidates derived from the type interferon family 
during the term of the agreement  we will work exclusively with bristol myers squibb to develop biopharmaceutical products based on the type interferon family  which includes our development candidate peg ifn l 
the ongoing co development of peg ifn l in hepatitis c is pursuant to this agreement 
as part of the co development co promotion and license agreement  bristol myers squibb receives an exclusive worldwide license to the core patents relating to the type interferon family and a co ownership interest in all core patents relating to the type interferon family filed outside of the united states 
in addition  bristol myers squibb receives a non exclusive license to other intellectual property rights relating to the licensed products 
we will be responsible for funding the first million of development costs in the united states and europe  which we expect to incur during phase b and phase clinical testing  and of all further development costs in the united states and europe 

table of contents in return  we receive million in march million additional license fee in march additional payments of up to million based on pre defined development and regulatory milestones for peg ifn l in hepatitis c  of which million is related to initiation of phase activities that are expected to occur in  up to million in development and regulatory milestones for other potential indications  and up to million based on pre defined annual sales milestones 
of the profits from the co commercialization of any type interferon family product within the united states 
we will also be responsible for of any loss from the co commercialization of any product within the united states  provided that a portion of our share of losses incurred through the initial launch phase will be deferred  and deferred losses will subsequently be deducted from milestones  royalties and our share of profits 
royalties on product sales outside the united states for peg ifn l 
the research and development activities are governed by a steering committee made up of an equal number of representatives from each company 
bristol myers squibb is responsible for all future manufacturing of peg ifn l  including product for phase clinical trials and commercial sale 
we have the right to co promote or co fund peg ifn l in the united states  and must exercise this right within days after acceptance by the fda of a biologics license application bla filing  in which case we will share any united states profits or losses 
in certain circumstances  we may opt out of co promotion or co funding in the united states  in which case we will share any united states profits or losses 
we have the right to discontinue co promotion and co funding in the united states  in which case we would be eligible to receive royalties on product sales in the united states 
under certain restricted circumstances  bristol myers squibb may terminate our right to co promote in the united states  provided that  in certain of these circumstances  we will retain the option to co fund and share product profits and losses 
if bristol myers squibb terminates our co promotion right and we do not have the option to co fund or choose not to exercise that option  we would receive royalties on product sales instead of sharing profits and losses in the united states 
royalties on sales vary based on annual sales volume and the degree of patent protection provided by the licensed intellectual property 
royalty payments may be reduced if bristol myers squibb is required to license additional intellectual property from one or more third parties in order to commercialize a product or  in certain circumstances  if a product suffers from competition 
royalty obligations under the agreement continue on a country by country basis until the date on which no valid patent claims relating to a product exist or  if the product is not covered by a valid patent claim  eleven years after the date of first sale of the product in that country 
the term of the agreement began on february  and will continue for as long as a type interferon product is the subject of an active development project or there is an obligation to pay royalties under the agreement 
merck serono strategic alliance agreement in october  we executed a strategic alliance agreement with serono sa to research  develop and commercialize product candidates  including protein and antibody therapeutics  based on a specific portfolio of our proprietary genes 
following the acquisition of serono in by merck kgaa  serono s rights under this agreement have been held by merck serono sa  an affiliate of merck kgaa 
in august  we executed a first amended and restated strategic alliance agreement 
the restated strategic alliance agreement retains the same five year term  with a maximum three year research period for each product candidate that may extend beyond the five year term on a product candidate by product candidate basis 

table of contents as part of the restated strategic alliance  merck serono received an option to acquire an exclusive worldwide  royalty bearing license to product candidates based on a specific portfolio of our proprietary genes  where the product candidate results from research that merck serono performs without us 
an alternating option to acquire an exclusive worldwide  royalty bearing license to product candidates based on a specific portfolio of our proprietary genes  where the product candidate results from research that merck serono performs jointly with us 
under this alternating option arrangement  we and merck serono take turns having the first right to obtain exclusive rights to the relevant product candidates 
upfront fees and potential milestone payments related to development progress  regulatory submissions and approvals for product candidates resulting from joint research under the restated strategic alliance that we exclusively license 
royalties on worldwide sales of licensed products  where the product results from joint research under the restated strategic alliance that we exclusively license 
in return  we receive upfront fees and potential milestone payments related to development progress  regulatory submissions and approvals for every product candidate exclusively licensed by merck serono 
royalties on worldwide sales of licensed products derived from product candidates based on a specific portfolio of our proprietary genes  where the product candidate results from any research under the restated strategic alliance agreement 
an exclusive license to a product candidate resulting from joint research under the restated strategic alliance will provide that if the licensee whether us or merck serono seeks a partner for the applicable product candidate  the licensor will have the right to opt in to co develop and co commercialize the product candidate on pre negotiated terms  including retroactive and prospective cost sharing  royalties and milestone fees 
in addition to its co development and co commercialization rights within the united states  merck serono will have an exclusive license outside of the united states whether merck serono opts in to develop a product candidate of ours or we opt in to develop a product candidate of merck serono 
during the research stage of the collaboration  the two companies will work together for five years expiring october to identify new product candidates from the specific portfolio of our proprietary genes 
upon the generation of a medical hypothesis by either company for a product candidate  merck serono has a specified amount of time to make a decision whether or not to co fund continued research on the product candidate 
if merck serono declines to continue  all rights to the product candidate revert to us 
if merck serono decides to collaborate  it will fund the majority of the research costs if we decide to participate  or of the costs if we decline 
the research collaboration for a product candidate can continue for up to three years or until the product candidate reaches the point of being designated a candidate for development 
at this time  merck serono has an option to obtain rights to the product candidate 
the option will be exclusive or alternating with our own depending on whether the merck serono bore the research costs alone or the parties shared such costs 
merck serono has a specified amount of time in which to exercise this option 
at the time of the original agreement  we executed agreements granting merck serono exclusive worldwide licenses to two preclinical candidates  fgf and il ra  and entered into a co development agreement relating to il subsequently  we licensed to merck serono the rights to il rc  which was designated as a candidate for development in june in connection with the original agreement we received a million upfront option fee 

table of contents million in license fees for fgf  il ra and il in addition  merck serono purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for a total of million  and entered into a related lockup agreement and a standstill agreement 
in connection with the amendment of the strategic alliance agreement  we amended and restated the co development agreements for il and il rc to provide for exclusive licenses to  in the case of il  zymogenetics and  in the case of il rc  merck serono 
the terms of these exclusive licenses are comparable to those under the amended and restated strategic alliance agreement 
merck serono development and marketing agreement for atacicept in august  we entered into a collaborative development and marketing agreement with ares trading sa  a wholly owned subsidiary of serono sa  focused on product candidates derived from two cellular receptors designated taci and bcma that are involved in the regulation of the human immune system 
following the acquisition of serono by merck kgaa in  serono s rights under this agreement have been held by merck serono sa in august  we entered into an amended and restated development and marketing agreement 
pursuant to the original collaborative development and marketing agreement  the parties had been co developing atacicept in autoimmune diseases and cancer 
merck serono now has exclusive worldwide rights to develop  market and sell products developed under the agreement  for which we will be entitled to receive milestone fees and royalties on worldwide net sales 
by converting to a royalty position  we will avoid a major capital commitment  reduce operating expenses and preserve cash over the next several years  while maintaining the value of our atacicept asset 
we granted merck serono an exclusive license to our intellectual property relating to taci  bcma and certain other related technologies to make  use  have made  sell  offer to sell and import products based on taci and bcma 
merck serono is required to pay royalties on sales  which vary based on annual sales volume and the degree of patent protection provided by the licensed intellectual property 
royalty payments may be reduced if merck serono is required to license additional intellectual property from one or more third parties in order to commercialize a product or  in certain circumstances  if a product suffers from competition 
royalty obligations under the agreement continue on a country by country basis until the date on which no valid patent claims relating to a product exist or  if the product is not covered by a valid patent claim  years from the date of first sale of the product in that country 
the agreement will continue for as long as a taci or bcma product is the subject of an active development project or there is an obligation to pay royalties under the agreement 
the agreement provides for an initial fee and milestone payments to be paid by merck serono in connection with the development and approval of products  up to an aggregate of million of which million has been received to date 
novo nordisk data sharing and cross license agreement for il in  novo nordisk initially licensed the rights to various embodiments of il in territories outside of north america and is obligated to make milestone payments based on the achievement of development milestones and royalties on sales of any resulting products 
royalty obligations under the agreement continue on a country by country basis until the date on which no valid patent claims relating to a product exist or  if the product is not covered by a valid patent claim  years from the date of first sale of the product in that country 
in  we entered into a collaborative data sharing and cross license agreement with novo nordisk to develop and execute a joint global clinical development plan for the il protein to achieve regulatory approval of a common product in the companies respective territories 
in january  the parties also entered into a manufacturing agreement whereby novo nordisk agreed to supply us with il protein for use in clinical trials 

table of contents in january  the parties restructured their relationship as it relates to il as part of the restructuring  the parties amended and restated the license agreement such that it no longer covers the il protein 
however  novo nordisk will continue to be responsible for developing other embodiments of il  including antibodies to il  outside north america 
novo nordisk will continue to be obligated to pay development milestones and royalties on any products developed by novo nordisk 
entered into a license and transfer agreement whereby we receive an exclusive license outside north america to the intellectual property rights that novo nordisk developed relating to the il protein  and are obligated to make milestone payments based on approval and sales and pay single digit royalties on sales of any resulting products 
in addition  zymogenetics will pay novo nordisk a portion of any third party license fees above a certain threshold 
terminated the collaborative data sharing and cross license agreement 
however  zymogenetics exclusive license in north america to the intellectual property rights that novo nordisk developed relating to the il protein survives termination 
terminated the manufacturing agreements and novo nordisk will transfer to us all manufacturing processes developed and its existing stock of il protein 
as a result of this restructuring  we now have worldwide development and commercialization rights for products based on the il protein 
patents and proprietary rights we seek appropriate patent protection for our proprietary technologies and product candidates by filing patent applications in the united states 
we have more than unexpired issued or allowed united states patents  and over pending united states patent applications 
when appropriate  we also seek foreign patent protection and to date have more than issued or allowed foreign patents 
our patents and patent applications are primarily directed to therapeutic protein based products 
we commonly seek claims directed to compositions of matter for genes and proteins  including antibodies  methods of using and methods of making 
when appropriate  we also seek claims to related technologies  such as reagents used in release assays and formulations 
we maintain patents and prosecute applications  worldwide  for technologies that we have outlicensed 
similarly  for development projects that are partnered  we work closely with our development partners to coordinate patent efforts  including filings  prosecution  term extension  defense and enforcement 
as our development product candidates advance through research and development  we seek to diligently identify and protect new inventions  such as combinations  improvements to methods of manufacturing or purification  and methods of treatment 
we also work closely with our researchers to identify and protect new inventions that could eventually add to our research and development pipeline 
patents expire  on a country by country basis  at various times depending on various factors  including the filing date of the corresponding patent application s  the availability of patent term extension and supplemental protection certificates  terminal disclaimers  etc 
for our commercial product and each of our product candidates  we have filed or expect to file multiple patent applications and expect to obtain multiple patents 
the table below provides expected dates for the first patent expiration in patent portfolios for our commercial product  recothrom  and product candidates in our development pipeline 
each expiration date may be subject to patent term extension  where the length of term extension would not exceed five years under current law and depends on factors such as the amount of time taken by the fda to review the first marketing approval application of a drug covered by the patent 

table of contents commercial product product candidate first patent expiration date recothrom rthrombin december  expected to extend until july under patent term extension il march peg ifn l september il mab march il mab january we require our research personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies  which are designed to strengthen and support our patent efforts 
in addition to our patented intellectual property  we also develop and seek to protect unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information  including our genetic sequence database  bioinformatics algorithms  research  preclinical and clinical data  development and manufacturing strategies 
our policy is to require our employees  consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and proprietary information agreement before beginning their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with us 
these agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances 
these agreements also generally provide that we shall own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us 
these agreements  however  may not provide effective protection of our technology  confidential information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  may not provide adequate remedies 
as part of our business strategy  we work with third parties in our research and development activities 
accordingly  disputes may arise about inventorship  ownership and corresponding rights to know how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our corporate partners  licensors  scientific collaborators and consultants 
in addition  other parties may circumvent any proprietary protection we do have 
these parties may independently develop equivalent technologies or independently gain access to and disclose substantially equivalent information  and confidentially agreements and material transfer agreements we have entered into with them may not provide us with effective protection 
refer to item a 
risk factors for additional information relating to our patents and proprietary rights 
government regulation regulation by government authorities in the united states  europe  japan and other countries is a significant consideration in our ongoing research and product development activities and in the manufacture and marketing of our potential products 
the fda and comparable regulatory bodies in other countries currently regulate therapeutic proteins and related pharmaceutical products as biologics 
biologics are subject to extensive pre and post market regulation by the fda  including regulations that govern the collection  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  potency  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of the products 
the time required for completing testing and obtaining approvals of our product candidates is uncertain but will take several years 
any delay in testing may hinder product development 
in addition  we may encounter delays in product development or rejections of product applications due to changes in fda or foreign regulatory laws or policies during the period of product development and testing 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may subject us to  among other things  civil penalties and criminal prosecution  restrictions on product development and production  suspension  delay or withdrawal of approvals  and the seizure or recall of products 
the lengthy process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any delay or failure  by us or our corporate partners  to obtain regulatory approvals could adversely affect our ability to commercialize product candidates  receive royalty payments and generate sales revenue 

table of contents the nature and extent of the governmental pre market review process for our potential products will vary  depending on the regulatory categorization of particular products 
the necessary steps before a new biological product may be marketed in the united states ordinarily include nonclinical laboratory and animal tests  compliance with product manufacturing requirements including  but not limited to  current good manufacturing practices gmp regulations  submission to the fda of an ind application  which must become effective before clinical trials may commence  completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use  submission to the fda of a bla  and fda review and approval of the bla prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product 
nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product  as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety concerns and efficacy of the product 
nonclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with current good laboratory practices regulations 
the results of nonclinical tests  together with extensive manufacturing information  analytical data and proposed clinical trial protocols  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind application  which must become effective before the initiation of clinical trials 
the ind application will automatically become effective days after receipt by the fda unless the fda indicates that the application does not contain sufficient information to permit initiation of the clinical studies 
if the fda raises any concerns related to the clinical program  it is possible that these concerns will not be resolved quickly  if at all 
in addition  the fda may impose a clinical hold on a proposed or ongoing clinical trial if  for example  safety concerns arise  in which case the trial cannot commence or recommence without fda authorization under terms sanctioned by the agency 
clinical trials involve the administration of the product to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials are conducted in accordance with current good clinical practices regulations under protocols that detail the objectives of the trial  inclusion and exclusion criteria  the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
protocols for each phase of the clinical trials are submitted to the fda as part of the original ind application or as an amendment to the ind application 
further  each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board at each institution 
the institutional review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possibility of liability of the institution conducting the trial 
an institutional review board may require changes in a protocol  and the submission of an ind application does not guarantee that a trial will be initiated or completed 
clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
in phase  the initial product is administered to healthy human subjects or patients  or both  to assess safety  metabolism  pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses 
phase usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific  targeted indications  to determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage  and to further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks 
if a compound appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase evaluations  phase trials may be undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy in comparison to standard therapies  generally within a broader patient population at geographically dispersed clinical sites 
phase protocols are reviewed with the fda to establish endpoints and data handling parameters 
phase  phase or phase testing may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time  if at all  with respect to any of our potential products 
furthermore  we  an institutional review board  the fda or other regulatory bodies may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 

table of contents the results of pharmaceutical development  nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the fda in the form of a bla for approval of the manufacture  marketing and commercial shipment of the biological product 
a bla contains extensive manufacturing information  and each manufacturing facility and quality system must be inspected and approved by the fda before a bla can be approved 
the inspection and approval process is likely to require substantial time  effort and resources  and necessary approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda may deny a bla if applicable regulatory criteria or clinical endpoints have not been met 
the fda may also require additional testing of the product or other information  or require post market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product 
in addition  after marketing approval is granted  the fda may require post marketing clinical trials  which typically entail extensive patient monitoring and may result in restricted marketing of an approved product for an extended period of time 
some of our product candidates may qualify as orphan drugs under the orphan drug act of this act generally provides incentives to manufacturers who undertake development and marketing of products to treat relatively rare diseases  defined as those diseases that affect fewer than  persons in the united states 
orphan drug status is granted for a product within a specific indication  therefore  it is possible for more than one product to receive orphan drug designation for the same indication 
a product that receives orphan drug designation by the fda is entitled to various advantages  including a seven year exclusive marketing period in the united states for that product claim and certain tax credits 
the fda granted il orphan drug status for the treatment of melanoma patients with advanced or aggressive disease 
however  it is possible that in the future none of our other product candidates will be designated as an orphan drug by the fda 
orphan drug designation may or may not have a positive effect on our revenues 
the fda has very broad enforcement authority under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health services act 
this authority extends to compliance with product manufacturing requirements  including current gmp regulations 
prior to approval of a bla  all third parties  domestic or foreign  that are involved in manufacturing  testing or release of our products must pass an fda inspection of their facility and quality systems 
the facilities are inspected for compliance with applicable requirements  including current gmp guidelines  and must submit to continued periodic inspection by the fda 
failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and criminal penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing us to correct deviations from fda standards 
in addition  the fda imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceutical and biologic products and medical devices  including  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotions  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
failure to abide by these regulations can result in civil and criminal penalties  as well as a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre cleared by the fda 
fda marketing approval is only applicable in the united states 
marketing approval in foreign countries is subject to the regulations of those countries 
the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing 
the time required to obtain approval outside of the united states may differ from that required for fda approval 
there are centralized procedures for filings in the european union eu countries  which allow submission of a single marketing authorization application to obtain approval in the approximately countries of the eu 
outside of the eu  most countries generally have their own procedures and requirements  and compliance with these procedures and requirements may be expensive and time consuming 
accordingly  there may be delays in obtaining required approvals from foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed  if approvals are ultimately received at all 
we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations  industry guidelines and recommendations relating to employment practices  safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals  the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  product liability  and unfair competition  including advertising and other promotional efforts 
government regulations that might result from future legislation or administrative action  including additions or changes to environmental laws  may materially affect our business operations and revenues 

table of contents competition we currently face competition from a range of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as academic and research institutions 
we compete with these entities to discover and obtain proprietary rights to new genes and their corresponding proteins and to commercialize the products we develop from these genes and proteins 
some of our competitors have greater resources and experience than we have in discovering  developing  manufacturing and selling protein based products 
we expect that competition in our field will continue to be intense 
recothrom  which was approved in january by the fda for use as a topical hemostat in the united states  faces substantial competition in the topical hemostat market 
in addition to recothrom  there are two stand alone thrombin products currently available in the united states thrombin jmi  a bovine plasma derived thrombin from king pharmaceuticals  inc  and evithrom  a pooled human plasma derived thrombin  from ethicon  inc  a johnson johnson company 
also  a number of other hemostatic agents are currently available on the market  including topical hemostats and fibrin sealants from johnson johnson wound management  a division of ethicon  inc and the biosurgery business unit of baxter bioscience 
furthermore  new products and technologies could be developed in the future to limit or control bleeding during surgeries 
we anticipate that our other product candidates currently in research or development will face intense competition in their respective therapeutic areas from gene or protein based products as well as other therapies 
in our efforts to research and develop new therapeutic proteins we will compete with other entities that are involved in the research and development of therapeutic proteins  including genentech  inc  human genome sciences  inc  medarex  inc 
and biogen idec inc  among others 
we also will face competition from large pharmaceutical and other companies that develop other types of products related to particular diseases 
although we believe that we are well positioned to compete effectively with respect to our existing and potential competitors  our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully maintain and expand as appropriate recothrom commercial infrastructure  including the product supply and sales force  and establish commercial infrastructure for other product candidates as necessary  develop products that are safer  more efficacious or more convenient to administer than other products in the marketplace  leverage our established collaborations and enter into new collaborations to support the development of our products  obtain timely regulatory approvals  manufacture our products in a cost effective manner in quantities sufficient to meet market demands  obtain adequate reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and health maintenance organizations  identify new product candidates through our internal discovery efforts or through in licensing  and obtain and enforce adequate patent protection for our genes  proteins and technologies 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including employees dedicated to research and development and employees dedicated to sales and marketing 
each of our employees had signed confidentiality and intellectual property agreements  and no employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced employment related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to invest in our company because these risk factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
however  the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our business our near term success is highly dependent on the commercialization of recothrom recombinant thrombin 
prior to the launch of recothrom in the united states in january  we had never sold or marketed a product 
our ability to generate product sales in the foreseeable future will depend solely on the commercialization of this product 
the successful commercialization of recothrom will depend on many factors  including the following successfully maintaining a product supply chain to meet demand  successfully maintaining a commercial infrastructure  including a sales force  competition from products that are already marketed or are being developed  our ability to penetrate the existing thrombin market and develop line extensions or complementary products  product demand within the medical community  and approval and product demand in countries outside the united states 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize recothrom  or if we are significantly limited in doing so  our business will be materially harmed 
we may be unable to successfully commercialize recothrom in the face of substantial competition 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the marketplace and generate market demand for recothrom 
recothrom faces substantial competition from alternative topical hemostats 
in the united states  stand alone plasma derived thrombin products on the market include thrombin jmi  a bovine plasma derived thrombin sold by king pharmaceuticals  inc  and evithrom  a pooled human plasma derived thrombin sold by ethicon  inc  a division of johnson johnson 
in addition  baxter international  inc markets the gelfoam plus hemostasis kit  which is pfizer inc s gelfoam sterile sponge co packaged with human plasma derived thrombin 
further  a number of companies  including johnson johnson and baxter international  inc  currently market other hemostatic agents that may compete with recothrom  including passive agents such as gelatin and collagen pads  as well as fibrin sealants and tissues glues 
many of these alternative hemostatic agents are inexpensive and have been widely used for many years 
consequently  physicians and medical decision makers may be hesitant to adopt recothrom 
despite the potential advantages of recothrom  we may be unsuccessful in competing against these companies and hemostatic agents 

table of contents further  even if our promotional efforts are successful  many hospitals will evaluate the entire product category in which recothrom falls using their pharmacy and therapeutic committees or formulary processes  including performing comparisons between recothrom and its competitors  including price comparisons 
the review cycle will vary among hospitals and could delay the uptake of recothrom 
prior to the launch of recothrom  the price of bovine plasma derived thrombin increased significantly over several years  however  subsequent to our launch  king pharmaceuticals has lowered the price of bovine plasma derived thrombin 
we may not be able to compete effectively if this price competition were to intensify 
furthermore  price competition would likely reduce the value of the overall thrombin market  which would impair our business prospects 
recothrom also must compete with the promotion of other types of products in order to be noticed by healthcare practitioners and our potential customers 
the level of promotional effort in the pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and medical device markets is substantial 
market acceptance of recothrom will be affected by the level and effectiveness of promotional effort that we are able to provide compared with others in this business 
the level and quality of our promotional efforts depends on our ability to train  deploy and retain an effective sales and marketing organization 
we cannot assure you that the level of promotional effort that we will be able to provide for recothrom will be sufficient to generate market demand for recothrom 
recothrom may not achieve market acceptance or generate significant revenues 
if recothrom fails to achieve market acceptance  our product sales  our ability to maintain current levels of research  development and commercialization activities  and our ability to become profitable in the future  will be adversely affected 
many factors may affect the rate and level of market acceptance of recothrom  including the effectiveness of our product differentiation  marketing  promotion  distribution  sales and pricing strategies and programs  and those of our competitors  our ability to provide acceptable evidence of the product s safety  efficacy  cost effectiveness and convenience compared to that of competing products  the perception of physicians and other members of the healthcare community of the product s safety  efficacy  cost effectiveness and convenience compared to that of alternative or competing products  the level of satisfaction with the product among healthcare providers  clinical practice or other guidelines regarding topical hemostats published by professional organizations or specialty groups  any publicity concerning the product or similar products  new data or adverse event information relating to the product or any similar products and any resulting regulatory action  regulatory constraints on our promotional materials and programs  the results of clinical studies conducted by us  or by our competitors  regulatory developments relating to the development  manufacture  commercialization or use of the product  the introduction  availability and acceptance of alternative or competing treatments  including lower priced products  the ability to gain formulary acceptance and favorable formulary positioning in a timely fashion or at all  our ability to supply recothrom to meet demand  
table of contents the continued availability of third parties to manufacture and distribute the product on acceptable terms  and the continued ability to manufacture commercial scale quantities of the product successfully and on a timely basis  and the outcome of patent  product liability or other litigation  if any  related to the product 
the approved product labeling and fda restrictions on promotional communications may adversely affect market acceptance of recothrom 
the approved product labeling for recothrom will have a direct and significant impact on our marketing  promotional and sales programs and could adversely affect market acceptance 
the label contains warnings and contraindications that are typical for thrombin and recombinant products  as well as some that are unique to recothrom 
while we hope customers will prefer the inherent properties of a recombinant product to plasma derived alternatives  the label does not state that recothrom has demonstrated superior safety or efficacy to competing thrombin products 
customers may be not be familiar with the labeling approved for competing products and may be unaware of side effects or other conditions associated with competitive products 
we may be restricted in our ability or success in raising awareness of these issues 
if potential purchasers or those influencing purchasing decisions  such as physicians and pharmacists  react negatively to our product because of their perception of the approved product labeling  or if they do not believe our product offers advantages over competing products  it may result in lower product acceptance and lower product revenues 
our competitors may seek and obtain approval of labeling containing fewer or less severe warnings and contraindications than required for our product 
in addition to approving product labeling  the fda typically reviews and provides advisory comments regarding core promotional materials for a pharmaceutical product 
the fda reviewed our core promotional materials in connection with the launch of recothrom  and we must submit all additional promotional materials to the fda at the time of their first use 
if the fda raises concerns regarding our promotional materials or messages  we may be required to modify or discontinue using them  and in some cases we may be required to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners 
our promotional materials or messages may not allow us to effectively differentiate and promote recothrom 
for example  the approved product labeling states that in the pivotal clinical trial we observed a lower incidence of immunogenicity of recothrom compared with that of bovine plasma derived thrombin  but that there is no demonstrated correlation of this finding to clinical outcome 
various laws and regulations prevent us from making statements that imply that our product offers superior efficacy or safety compared with competitive products  including bovine plasma derived thrombin 
accordingly  we may be unable to address all potential questions and concerns regarding our product or its label  or our competitors products  which could result in lower product demand and lower product sales 
a lack of familiarity with recothrom and our company may adversely affect market acceptance of recothrom 
we may be hampered in our promotional efforts by a lack of familiarity with recothrom and our company among healthcare practitioners 
because recothrom is our first product introduced commercially  there is limited  if any  awareness and goodwill associated with our company s name 
even though we co promote the product with bayer healthcare  we may not benefit from customer recognition of that company s name or goodwill 
healthcare providers may prefer products from companies with which they have long standing relationships 
any or all of these factors may result in less market demand and lower sales of recothrom 
if bayer healthcare  upon whom we rely to co promote recothrom and provide additional medical science liaisons  fails to perform  our business may be adversely affected 
under a agreement  bayer healthcare llc co promotes recothrom and provides additional medical science liaisons in the united states for a limited time 
our success in selling recothrom depends in 
table of contents part on the efforts of bayer healthcare 
collaboration with bayer healthcare involves certain risks  including  but not limited to  risks that bayer healthcare will not effectively co promote recothrom  not provide effective medical science liaisons  or not devote adequate resources or effort to co promote recothrom according to our plans 
in addition  we must ensure that our own promotional and sales activities are coordinated with those of bayer healthcare 
any such failure by bayer healthcare or in the coordination of our efforts may result in decreased product sales and negatively affect our reputation and that of recothrom  which would harm our business 
if we or others identify previously unknown side effects of recothrom or product manufacturing problems occur  our business would be adversely affected and could lead to a significant decrease in the sales of recothrom or to the fda s withdrawal of marketing approval 
if we or others identify previously unknown side effects  or detect unexpected safety signals  for recothrom or any products perceived to be similar to recothrom  or if serious product manufacturing problems occur  then in any of these circumstances sales of recothrom may decrease significantly  regulatory approvals for recothrom may be restricted or withdrawn  we may decide to  or be required to  send product warning letters or field alerts to physicians  pharmacists and hospitals  reformulation of the product  additional preclinical or clinical studies  changes in labeling or changes to or re approvals of manufacturing facilities may be required  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and government investigations and lawsuits  including class action suits  may be brought against us 
any of the above occurrences would harm or prevent sales of recothrom  increase our expenses and impair our ability to successfully commercialize recothrom 
furthermore  now that recothrom is approved in the united states  it is being used in a wider population and in a less rigorously controlled fashion than in clinical studies 
it is expected that some patients exposed to recothrom will become sick or die suddenly  that in some or even many of these cases there will not be sufficient information available to rule out recothrom as a contributing factor or cause of sickness or mortality  and that safety reporting from physicians or from us to regulatory authorities may link recothrom to death or other serious adverse effects 
as a result  regulatory authorities  healthcare practitioners  third party payers or patients may perceive or conclude that the use of recothrom is associated with death or other serious adverse effects  any of which could mean that our ability to commercialize recothrom could be adversely affected and our business could be impaired 
in addition  our competitors and others are free to generate new data regarding recothrom  which they may publish in the scientific literature or otherwise publicize  without our consent or control 
distribution of recothrom is highly concentrated among a small group of wholesale drug distributors on whom we rely for crucial functions 
we distribute recothrom through a small number of large wholesale drug distributors  primarily amerisourcebergen corporation  cardinal health  inc and mckesson corporation  which control a significant 
table of contents share of the pharmaceutical market in the united states 
our ability to distribute recothrom and to recognize revenues on a timely basis substantially depends on our ability to maintain commercially reasonable agreements with each of these wholesale distributors and the extent to which these distributors  over which we have no control  comply with such agreements 
unless other distributors absorb the incremental sales volume or we are able to sell directly  the loss or bankruptcy of any of these distributors would materially and adversely affect our future results of operations  financial condition and our ability to distribute recothrom 
further  we rely on our distributors to provide us with accurate and timely information regarding their inventories and complaints about recothrom 
if they fail to provide this information  or if they provide incomplete  faulty or untimely information  our ability to forecast product demand will be hindered and our business may be significantly harmed 
guidelines  recommendations and other literature published by various organizations  including competitors  may affect the use of recothrom 
in addition to government agencies  whose regulations may restrict our promotion and sales of recothrom  various professional societies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations periodically publish guidelines  recommendations and other literature to the healthcare and patient communities 
these publications may relate to such matters as product usage  labeling and packaging  dosage  route of administration  and use of related or competing products 
these organizations have in the past made recommendations about recothrom or products that compete with recothrom  such as the treatment guidelines of the society of thoracic surgeons 
competitors may also conduct and publish the results of clinical trials aimed at diminishing concerns about their own products  or indicating advantages over recothrom 
these types of publications could result in negative perceptions about or decreased use of recothrom 
in addition  such publications could also negatively impair the perception of our company by the investment community or shareholders and could adversely affect the market price of our stock 
codes  guidelines and policies published by the pharmaceuticals research and manufacturers of america and similar organizations may affect our ability to effectively promote recothrom 
the pharmaceuticals research and manufacturers of america or phrma is an influential industry trade association that encourages self policing measures by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies to prevent improper promotional practices and improper interactions with health care providers 
over the past several years  there has been increasing scrutiny of pharmaceutical promotional activities by government agencies  professional organizations  patient advocacy groups and pharmaceutical competitors  which has resulted in substantial  well publicized fines  and has terminated or altered some long standing promotional practices 
state and federal agencies may adopt or rely on phrma s codes and recommendations when establishing new legal requirements or evaluating our promotional practices for compliance with existing laws and industry standards 
the company is committed to promoting its products in an ethical and appropriate manner 
principles and guidelines promulgated by phrma  including the recent revisions to the phrma code on interactions with health care professionals hcps  may limit our ability to effectively gain access to and communicate with potential customers 
among other things  the revised phrma code narrowly limits the provision of meals for hcps and restricts the involvement of industry sponsors with the conduct and content of continuing medical education  support of education and professional meetings  and use of speaker programs 
the restrictions imposed by codes established by phrma and similar organizations could limit our ability to interact with customers and promote recothrom  and any failure to follow such codes could harm our reputation and could increase the risk of government investigations or other actions against us 
recothrom has not been approved for sale outside of the united states  and may never receive foreign marketing approval 
under a agreement  our ex us licensee bayer schering pharma ag agreed to seek applicable government approvals for and develop and market recothrom outside the united states 
during  bayer 
table of contents schering pharma filed applications in europe and canada  however  we and bayer schering pharma do not know whether foreign regulatory authorities will grant marketing approval to recothrom 
in the united states  recothrom was approved by the fda on the basis of clinical studies showing non inferiority to bovine plasma derived thrombin 
the european medicines agency  health canada and other regulatory authorities may require other clinical trials having a different comparator or study design prior to  or after  approval  especially because bovine plasma derived thrombin is not currently approved in europe or canada 
in addition  the foreign regulatory authorities may not be satisfied with the safety and efficacy data submitted in support of the foreign applications  which could result in either non approval or a requirement of additional clinical trials or further analysis of existing data 
furthermore  as an element of the foreign approval process  the applicable regulatory authority must be satisfied with the processes and facilities for all stages of the manufacture  packaging and distribution of recothrom  which may include physical inspections of many or all relevant facilities 
any conclusion that there are shortcomings in the processes  facilities  quality control or oversight of contract manufacturers  or other quality assurance procedures related to manufacture  packaging and distribution of the drug could result in a significant delay in or failure to receive foreign approval 
lack of or limited marketing approval in a particular country could prevent or limit bayer schering pharma from selling recothrom in that country  which could significantly harm our business 
we will be dependent on the efforts of bayer schering pharma to market and promote recothrom in countries outside the united states where recothrom may receive approval and we may otherwise be limited due to our relationship with bayer 
under our license and collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma  we will be dependent solely on bayer schering pharma to promote and market recothrom in countries outside the united states where recothrom is approved 
we have limited ability to direct bayer schering pharma in its promotion of recothrom in foreign countries 
bayer schering pharma may not have sufficient experience to promote topical hemostat products in foreign countries and may fail to devote appropriate resources to this task 
no form of thrombin is currently sold in europe or canada  and  therefore  bayer schering pharma will have to create a new market for recothrom  an endeavor in which it may fail 
if bayer schering pharma fails to effectively promote recothrom in foreign countries  we may be unable to obtain any meaningful remedy against bayer schering pharma 
in addition  bayer schering pharma has the right to terminate the license and collaboration agreement for its own convenience and upon its own election  even if we are in full compliance with our obligations under the agreement 
if bayer schering pharma were to fail to perform  or to terminate the agreement  sales of recothrom in foreign countries may be harmed  which would negatively impact our business 
further  pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement  we granted to bayer schering pharma certain license rights to other potential products containing recombinant thrombin 
we retained the right to co develop such other products and the exclusive right to commercialize them in the united states  however  bayer schering pharma has the ability to license the full rights to these products outside the united states  and even if it does not elect to do so  we will not be permitted to commercialize other products containing recombinant thrombin outside of the united states 
overall  our agreement with bayer schering pharma may limit the financial benefits we derive from products containing recombinant thrombin by precluding us from markets outside the united states  limit the financial benefits we may derive from products containing recombinant thrombin by allowing bayer schering pharma to license them in exchange for predetermined payments and royalties and with predetermined cost sharing arrangements  which payments and royalty rates may be less than  and which cost sharing arrangements may be less favorable to us than  terms we might otherwise obtain in collaborative or licensing arrangements with other parties  
table of contents result in a delay in developing one or more products containing recombinant thrombin due to bayer schering pharma s internal decisions  procedures or development strategies  and prevent us from collaborating with or licensing a product candidate containing recombinant thrombin to another company that  by virtue of its particular skills and capabilities  may be a more desirable collaborator or licensing partner for that particular product candidate than bayer schering pharma 
we have limited composition of matter patent protection for recothrom 
while we hold patents to the manufacture of recothrom  our composition of matter patent protection is limited to a key intermediate in the production of recombinant thrombin 
accordingly  we may not be able to prevent other parties from developing alternate methods of manufacturing recombinant thrombin or from selling recombinant thrombin 
if a third party sold recombinant thrombin manufactured using an alternate method of manufacturing  it could significantly impair our business 
in addition  after fda approval of recothrom  we filed an application for patent term extension of our relevant us patents  but thus far  we have not received confirmation from the us patent and trademark office that the extension will be granted to the extent we requested  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain the requested term extension of our recothrom patents  it could limit our ability to stop competitors and could impair our business 
certain third parties hold patents relating to thrombin 
we are aware of certain united states and european patents and patent applications held by third parties relating to thrombin and to methods of manufacture of thrombin and other recombinant proteins 
our analyses of these patents lead us to conclude that we do not and will not infringe these patents and that many of the claims of these patents are invalid or unenforceable  however  the patent holders  courts or other governmental or legal entities may conclude that our products  processes and or actions in developing  manufacturing or selling recothrom do infringe one or more patents 
we may seek licenses to such patents if  in our judgment  such licenses are needed 
if any licenses are required  we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
if these licenses are not obtained  we might be prevented from selling recothrom or from using certain of our technologies for the manufacture of recothrom 
our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require may severely harm our business 
we rely on third parties to manufacture commercial supplies of recothrom and our product candidates and  therefore  we may not be able to effectively control production or obtain adequate supplies  which could cause delays in product manufacturing  subject us to product shortages or reduce product sales 
the manufacture and delivery of sufficient quantities of pharmaceutical products and devices is a time consuming and complex process 
except for limited capabilities to produce protein product candidates for clinical trials  we currently have no internal manufacturing capabilities 
in order to successfully commercialize our products  including recothrom  and continue to develop our product candidates  including line extensions for recothrom  and peg ifnl  we need to contract or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing 
for example  we have entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories for commercial scale production of bulk drug substance recombinant thrombin and an agreement with patheon italia spa  inc for fill and finish of the dosage form of recothrom 
we have also entered into agreements with several suppliers of critical raw materials  manufacturing process intermediates and components for recothrom  some of which are located outside the united states 
for our peg ifnl product candidate  we will rely on our collaborative partner bristol myers squibb to manufacture supplies for late stage clinical trials and  if approved  commercial sales 

table of contents reliance on third party manufacturers  other vendors and collaborators limits our control regarding many aspects of the manufacturing and delivery processes and therefore exposes us to a variety of significant risks relating to our ability to commercialize our products or conduct clinical trials including  for example  due to contractual provisions allocating supplies in the event of a shortage  reliance on third parties for legal and regulatory compliance and quality assurance  third party refusals to supply on a long term basis  third party insistence on minimum and or maximum levels of supply and related restrictions on our ability to increase or decrease supply  problems with the manufacturing facilities used by third parties  including problems leading to production delays  unanticipated expenses and withdrawal of facilities approvals by regulatory authorities  breach of agreements by third parties  and termination  price increases  or non renewal of agreements by third parties  based on other business priorities  at times that are costly or inconvenient for us 
furthermore  the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers and collaborators will be periodically inspected by the fda 
a manufacturer s failure to satisfy regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of fda approval for that facility  including those used in the production of recothrom and our clinical product candidates 
in complying with fda regulations  we and our contract manufacturers will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality assurance to assure that our products meet applicable requirements 
if any of these risks occur  our product supply could be interrupted resulting in lost or delayed revenues  delayed clinical trials  and significant increase in production costs and cost of goods 
in addition  if  for any reason  we are required to engage an additional  second source or replacement manufacturer or other vendor  the investment of funds and management time could be significant 
for example  we could be required to engage a replacement manufacturer if our current manufacturers are adversely impacted by the current global economic crisis 
the cost and time to establish and license these new manufacturing facilities would be substantial 
as a result  using a new manufacturer or other vendor could disrupt our ability to market our products  subject us to product shortages  reduce product sales  and or reduce our profit margins 
further  any delay or disruption in the manufacturing of bulk product  the dosage form of our products or other product components  including spray applicators for delivery of recothrom  could also harm our reputation in the medical community 
overall  while we believe that business relations between us and our manufacturers and other supply chain vendors are generally good  we cannot predict whether any of the manufacturers and other vendors that we may use will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity or timeliness for the manufacture of recothrom  its intermediates or components or for our other product candidates 
there are limited numbers of potential manufacturers and other vendors on whom we could rely to supply recothrom and our other product candidates 
there are a limited number of manufacturers and other vendors that operate under the fda s cgmp regulations capable of manufacturing for us  and we have not established backup manufacturers and suppliers for recothrom or any of our product candidates 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain third party manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms  or if we lose a significant supplier used for recothrom  its line extensions  if any  or for our other product candidates  we may not be able to market our products  meet 
table of contents certain contractual supply obligations or complete development of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
for example  under our agreements with bayer  we are required to provide bayer with recothrom and may be in breach of the agreement if we cannot make the required deliveries on time 
in addition  some of the inventions and patents licensed to us were initially developed at universities or other not for profit institutions with funding support from an agency of the united states government 
in accordance with federal law  our licensees or we may be required to manufacture in the united states products covered by those patents  unless we can obtain a waiver from the government on the basis that such domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible 
we have not attempted to secure any such waivers from the government  and do not know if they would be sought or available if sought 
if we are not able to obtain such waivers  if requested  on a timely basis  we might be forced to seek manufacturing arrangements at higher prices  or on otherwise less favorable terms  than might be available to us in the absence of this domestic manufacturing requirement 
failure to effectively manage the recothrom supply chain could result in inventory shortages  supply interruptions or inventory obsolescence 
our supply chain for recothrom  its intermediates and components  is particularly complex and involves a number of third parties on several continents 
in addition to coordinating the efforts of these third party contractors  we must navigate the laws and regulations of multiply jurisdictions  including tax laws  and our failure to do so effectively may negatively impact our business 
in addition  our contract manufacturers and other vendors have not produced recothrom  its intermediates or components  for commercial use for a sustained period of time 
as such  unforeseeable risks may be encountered as we  together with our manufacturers and other vendors  continue to develop familiarity and experience with regard to manufacturing recothrom  its intermediates and components 
failure to adequately manage our supply chain could result in inventory shortages or other supply interruptions that could negatively impact recothrom sales and  consequently  negatively impact product revenue 
we have limited expiration dating for recothrom 
consequently  if we are unable to sell at forecasted levels we may have excess recothrom inventory  resulting in inventory obsolescence  increased costs of product sales and ineffective use of our financial resources 
as we progress from a primarily research and development company to a company increasingly involved in commercialization of products  we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations 
as we commercialize recothrom and continue to advance product candidates through clinical trials and on to commercialization  we may need to expand our development and commercial operations capabilities 
if we are not able to provide these capabilities internally  we may need to rely on collaborative partners or other third parties to provide these services for us 
expanded operations would add significant complexity to our business and responsibilities to certain members of our management and key personnel 
we may need to manage relationships with an increasing number of collaborative partners  suppliers and third party contractors 
if we are unable to successfully provide the required infrastructure  either internally or through third parties  and successfully manage an increasing number of relationships  we will have difficulty growing our business 
we have rapidly expanded our field force operations  including sales personnel and medical science liaisons  and any difficulties managing these functions or the related growth could disrupt our operations 
prior to launch of recothrom in the united states  we rapidly expanded and developed our field force operations  including sales personnel and medical science liaisons  which included  for the first time  hiring employees based outside of our washington state headquarters 
we increased expenditures in these areas  hiring 
table of contents additional employees and expanding the scope of our operations 
since the launch of recothrom  we have had limited opportunity to test our field force operations  and our ability to manage them 
if we are unable to effectively manage our field force operations  or if our capabilities prove to be inadequate  we may not be able to effectively implement or sustain our business plan 
we may be unable to satisfy the rigorous government regulations relating to the development and marketing approval of our product candidates 
the successful commercialization of il  peg ifn l or any of our other product candidates will depend on obtaining marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities in each market in which we or our collaborators or our licensees intend to market the product candidates 
any failure to receive the marketing approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates could severely harm our business 
the fda regulates  among other things  the collection  testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  potency  labeling  storage  record keeping  quality systems  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of therapeutic products 
if our potential products are marketed abroad  they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
except for recothrom in the united states  none of our product candidates has been approved for sale in any country  and our experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals is limited 
the regulatory review and approval process of governmental authorities  which includes nonclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate  is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
for example  securing fda approval requires the submission of extensive nonclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish the product candidate s safety and effectiveness  including significant information regarding the chemistry  manufacturing and controls or the product 
the approval process typically takes many years to complete and may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing clinical studies or other risk management measures 
in addition  we may not achieve governmental approval  including that of the fda  of a product candidate even if we have met our internal safety and efficacy criteria and completed clinical trials 
also  any regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  once obtained  may be withdrawn 
government regulation may result in prohibitions or significant delays in the marketing of potential products  recalls and discontinuation of the marketing of potential products  and limitations of the indicated uses for which potential products may be marketed 
if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business  in each applicable country  we may be subject to sanctions  including the temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls  marketing restrictions and civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  some of our product candidates may be approved for use in combination with other products that are not our own 
failure by any of these products to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to their business  resulting in potential product restrictions or recalls  may materially harm our ability to successfully commercialize and generate revenues from our products used in combination regimens 
clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval 
clinical trials involving il  peg ifn l or any of our other product candidates may reveal that those candidates are ineffective  are insufficiently effective given their safety profile  have unacceptable toxicity or safety profiles or have other unacceptable side effects 
in addition  data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretations  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
likewise  the results of preliminary studies do not predict clinical success  and larger and later stage clinical trials may not produce the same results as earlier stage trials 
frequently  product candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical trials have subsequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials 
similarly  clinical trial results 
table of contents may vary between different arms of a clinical trial for reasons that we cannot adequately explain 
in addition  clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts 
we may be required to defend lawsuits and pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products and product candidates 
the design  testing  manufacture and sale of therapeutic products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity  even if the claims arise from use of the product in a manner inconsistent with label or other instructions 
in addition  recothrom is and will be used on patients undergoing surgery  where there are significant risks to patients 
further  our marketing and promotional efforts for recothrom could increase the risk of litigation based on claims by our competitors or others of unfair competition or unfair advertising 
we may incur significant expenses if any of these lawsuits against us were to be successful 
even if such lawsuits are without merit or otherwise unsuccessful  they could cause adverse publicity  divert management attention and be costly to respond to  and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  including negatively impacting our share price 
although we maintain product liability and general insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to cover such claims 
we do not know if we will be able to maintain existing or obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
this type of insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  we may be unable to continue to develop or commercialize recothrom or any other product candidates 
any product liability claims  whether or not ultimately successful  could have a material negative effect on our reputation  stock price  the market acceptance and sales of products and our financial condition and results 
our use of collaborations to leverage our capabilities may not be successful 
we have entered into collaboration arrangements with partners to co develop and co commercialize products and will continue to evaluate similar opportunities 
to be successful  we must identify and attract partners whose competencies and priorities complement ours 
we must enter into collaboration agreements on terms beneficial to us and integrate and coordinate their processes  resources and capabilities with our own on a continuing basis 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into collaboration agreements with acceptable partners or negotiating favorable terms in these agreements or maintaining such relationships so as to reap benefits from them over time 
also  we may be unsuccessful in integrating the resources  processes  capabilities or priorities of these collaborators on a continuing basis 
in addition  our collaborators may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than we originally expected 
if we are unsuccessful in our collaborative efforts  our ability to develop and market product candidates could be severely limited 
we have very recently initiated our collaborative efforts with bristol myers squibb for the development of peg ifn l 
this collaboration will require close and frequent communications between several different teams within the respective companies  technology transfer  and in general a collaborative sharing of responsibilities for clinical studies and all other development activities 
while we are hopeful that we will be able to integrate our processes with our counterparts at bristol myers squibb  we have limited experience with them and are unable to accurately predict our ultimate ability to collaborate with them 
difficulties in collaboration could result in lower than expected revenue  delays in development  loss of market opportunities  and significant deterioration in the value of this product candidate and our company 

table of contents we may not be able to generate any revenue from product candidates developed by collaborators or licensees if they do not successfully develop those candidates 
we may be unable to derive any value from product candidates developed by collaborators or licensees  including novo nordisk  merck serono  bayer schering pharma and bristol myers squibb 
our ability to generate revenues from existing or future collaborations and license arrangements is subject to numerous risks  including the possibility that our collaborators or licensees lack sufficient financial  technical or other capabilities to develop these product candidates  the possibility that our collaborators or licensees choose to scale back or discontinue their development activities due to changes in their strategies  restructuring  mergers or acquisitions  the length of time that it takes for our collaborators or licensees to solve technical problems or achieve various clinical development and regulatory approval milestones  differences in opinion about development  clinical and regulatory strategies and timeframes  the inability of collaborators or licensees to successfully address any regulatory or technical challenges they may encounter  and the possibility that these product candidates may not be effective or may prove to have undesirable side effects  unacceptable toxicities or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use 
because we will depend on third parties to conduct certain laboratory tests and clinical trials  we may encounter delays in or lose some control over our efforts to develop product candidates 
we commonly rely on third parties to conduct laboratory tests and clinical trials for us  especially to the extent clinical trials include sites outside the united states 
if we are unable to obtain these services on acceptable terms  we may not be able to complete our product development efforts in a timely manner 
also  to the extent we will rely on third parties for laboratory tests and clinical trials  we may lose some control over these activities or be unable to manage them appropriately  or may become too dependent on these parties 
these third parties may not complete the tests or trials on our schedule  and the tests or trials may be methodologically flawed  may not comply with applicable laws or be otherwise defective 
any delays or difficulties associated with third party laboratory tests or clinical trials may delay and increases the risks and costs of the development of our product candidates 
we have shifted our discovery efforts to therapeutic antibodies with which we have limited experience and face competition 
we have shifted our discovery efforts to focus on developing therapeutic antibodies 
we have limited experience developing antibodies and may not be successful in these efforts 
in addition  there is a great deal of competition in the field of antibody products 
our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms and universities and other research institutions 
a number of our largest competitors  including genentech  inc  amgen inc  astrazeneca plc and human genome sciences  inc  are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that address the same diseases that we are pursuing  and it is possible that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for these diseases will increase 
we may be unable to commercialize antibody products 
we may not be successful in obtaining adequate  if any  patent coverage for our discoveries and therapeutic antibody products 
in addition  third parties may own key technology or target patents or dominating patents that may prevent us from developing  manufacturing or commercializing therapeutic antibodies 
for example  we are 
table of contents aware of broad patents owned by others relating to the discovery  development  manufacture  use and sale of recombinant humanized antibodies  recombinant humanized single chain antibodies  recombinant human antibodies  and recombinant human single chain antibodies and other technologies 
many of our product candidates may use or include such technologies 
while we have entered into agreements with certain third parties in order to gain access to their technology  often the technology is made available on a target by target basis upon submission of specific targets and payment of a fee 
we have no assurance that a license to a particular target will be available until it is submitted as part of such a process 
we are also aware that third parties own patents related to the target molecules with which our antibody products are designed to interact 
even if we are successful at obtaining patent protection for our antibody product candidates  these antibody product candidates may infringe such third party patents covering the targets 
we may not be able to obtain necessary rights to such targets  or to key technologies needed for the discovery  development  production or commercialization of therapeutic antibodies through licensing agreements on terms attractive to us  if at all 
if these licenses are not obtained  we might be prevented from developing antibodies aimed at such targets or from using certain of our technologies for the generation and development of our new discoveries 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to obtain needed licenses  our ability to develop and commercialize antibody product candidates could be severely limited 
any patent infringement or other legal claims that might be brought against us may cause us to incur significant expenses  enjoin our development or commercialization of such products  divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns and  if successfully asserted against us  require us to pay substantial damages 
if our research and development programs fail to result in additional product candidates  our potential to generate revenue will be substantially limited 
potential product candidates from our research and development programs are at relatively early stages and will require significant research  development  preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing scale up activities  regulatory approval and or commitments of significant resources before commercialization 
we cannot predict whether our efforts will lead to the development of any additional product candidates that could generate revenues for us 
the failure to attract or retain key management or other personnel could decrease our ability to discover  develop and commercialize potential products 
we depend on our senior executive officers as well as key scientific  management and other personnel 
only a small number of our key personnel are bound by employment agreements  and those with employment agreements are bound only for a limited period of time 
further  we have not purchased key person life insurance policies for any of our executive officers or key personnel 
competition for scientists and other qualified employees is intense among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and the loss of qualified employees  or an inability to attract  retain and motivate the additional highly skilled employees required for the expansion of our activities  could hinder our ability to discover  develop and commercialize potential products 
we may expand our business through the acquisition of companies or businesses or in licensing product candidates that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
we may in the future seek to expand our products and capabilities by acquiring one or more companies or businesses or in licensing one or more product candidates 
acquisitions and in licenses involve numerous risks  including substantial cash expenditures  potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition  difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies  
table of contents diverting our management s attention away from other business concerns  entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  and potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies or businesses 
historically  we have not expanded our business through acquisition or in licensing and  therefore  our experience in making acquisitions and in licensing is limited 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition or in license will result in short term or long term benefits to us 
we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business or in licensed product candidate 
in addition  our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions and in licenses 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired businesses or companies or in licensed product candidates work or be successful 
furthermore  the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or company or in licensed product candidate may require a substantial capital investment by us 
we may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our stock  which could dilute our current shareholders ownership interest  or securities convertible into our stock  which could dilute current shareholders ownership interest upon conversion 
our patents and patent applications may not result in meaningful protection against competitors  provide us with any competitive advantage  or provide adequate protection or rights for new discoveries  and our competitors may commercialize the discoveries we patent or attempt to patent 
we own or in the case of certain foreign patents related to peg ifnl  co own with bristol myers squibb or hold exclusive rights to many issued united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications related to the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates 
these patents and applications cover composition of matter for genes  proteins  and antibodies  medical indications  methods of use  methods of making  formulations  technologies and other inventions related to therapeutic proteins and antibodies 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates in the united states and other countries 
although we diligently seek to identify and protect our important discoveries and inventions  we may fail to file timely patent applications 
we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
our pending and future patent applications covering products and product candidates may not meet the statutory requirements for patentability  meaning that our applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  and  if issued  such patents may not be valid or enforceable 
our rights under any patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise cover commercially valuable products or processes 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy for eighteen months after the filing of the applications  and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be sure that the inventors of subject matter covered by our patents and patent applications were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
our patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage 
although we have a number of issued patents  the discoveries or technologies covered by these patents may not have any value 
these issued patents may not provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors  nor may they provide all rights necessary to commercialize our products or product candidates 
in addition  we may not be able to or allowed to obtain patent term extension or restoration on patents covering our products in a manner that would provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors 
other parties may have a dominating or blocking patent position covering a composition of matter  or methods of making or using our products or product candidates 
in addition  other parties may be able to design around our issued patents or independently develop products having attributes or uses similar or identical to our 
table of contents patented product candidates 
the business model of some companies is to design around patented marketed protein based products by altering the amino acid sequence of the marketed product  thereby avoiding the patent  but maintaining functional equivalence 
similarly  it may be easier to develop equivalent versions of monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors than to develop equivalent versions of the proteins with which they interact because there is often more than one antibody or receptor that can have the same therapeutic effect 
consequently  any of our existing or future patents that cover monoclonal antibodies or soluble receptors may not provide any meaningful protection against competitors 
in addition  other parties may discover uses for genes or proteins that are different from the uses described in our patents  and these other uses may be separately patentable 
if another party holds a patent on the use of a gene or protein  then even if we hold the patent covering the composition of matter of the gene or protein itself  that party might prevent us from promoting and selling any product directed to such use 
also  other parties may have patents covering the composition of matter of genes or proteins for which we have patents covering only methods of use or methods of manufacture 
furthermore  our patents on recombinant proteins or their precursors or methods of manufacturing such proteins  such as our patents covering the precursor to recothrom and its method of manufacture  may not prevent competitors from developing other precursors or methods of manufacturing these proteins 
third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope  validity or enforceability 
third parties  including our competitors and licensees  may initiate proceedings to limit the scope  validity or enforceability of our patents  including but not limited to inter partes re examination proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  opposition proceedings in patent authorities outside of the united states  declaratory judgment proceedings in united states courts  or in the event a third party independently makes an invention similar to ours  interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention 
likewise  we may initiate inter partes proceedings to challenge the scope  validity or enforceability of third party patents 
the outcome of any such proceeding is uncertain and could result in judicial determinations that our patents are invalid  limited in scope  not infringed  and or unenforceable  which would impair our business 
participating in such proceedings or other challenges  whether initiated by us or by third parties may require significant expenditures and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns  which may also impair our business 
third parties may infringe our patents 
competitors and other third parties may infringe our patents  or use inventions described in our patent applications 
it may be difficult or impossible for us to police third party activities and detect such infringement  for example  we may be unable to discover a competitor s manufacturing process to determine whether it infringes a patent claims to a method of manufacture 
patent litigation is very expensive and time consuming and is a distraction to management and personnel who are needed to supply evidence and support to litigation efforts 
enforcing our patents against third parties may require significant expenditures regardless of outcome 
we may incur substantial expenditures in such patent litigation and the outcome of any lawsuit is uncertain 
further  challenges raised in patent infringement litigation initiated by us or by third parties may result in determinations that our patents have not been infringed or that they are invalid  unenforceable or otherwise subject to limitations 
consequently  third parties  including licensees  may be able to use the discoveries or technologies claimed or described in our patents without paying licensing fees or royalties to us  which could significantly diminish the value of our intellectual property 
we may be subject to patent infringement claims  which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our products and product candidates 
third parties may claim that our products or product candidates  or processes or related technologies infringe their patents 
the risk of infringement claims filed against us is likely to increase as we commercialize 
table of contents products or move product candidates closer to commercialization 
furthermore  we may not have identified or analyzed all united states and foreign patents that pose a risk of our infringement 
any patent infringement or other legal claims that might be brought against us may cause us to incur significant expenses  divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns and  if successfully asserted against us  require us to pay substantial damages 
in addition  as a result of a patent infringement suit  we may be forced to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling products or product candidates that are claimed to infringe a third party s patent unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property 
we may be unable to obtain these rights on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain rights to a third party s patented intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  allowing our competitors to obtain access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations  which could severely harm our business 
patent protection for protein based therapeutic products and other biotechnology inventions is subject to a great deal of uncertainty  and if patent laws or the interpretation of patent laws change  our competitors may be able to develop and commercialize products based on our discoveries 
patent protection for protein based therapeutic products is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
in recent years  there have been significant changes in patent law  including the legal standards that govern the scope of protein and biotechnology patents 
standards for patentability of full length and partial genes  and their corresponding proteins  are changing 
also  there is substantial uncertainty regarding the patentability of proteins without known function or specific correlation with diseases 
recent court decisions have made it more difficult to obtain patents  by making it more difficult to satisfy the requirement of non obviousness  have decreased the availability of injunctions against infringers  have decreased the likelihood of proving willfulness  and have increased the likelihood of challenging the validity of a patent through a declaratory judgment action 
taken together  these decisions make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain  license and enforce our patents 
in addition  in recent years  several members of the united states congress have made numerous proposals to change the patent statute 
these proposals include measures that  among other things  would expand the ability of third parties to oppose united states patents  introduce the first to file standard to the united states patent system  and limit damages an infringer is required to pay 
if the patent statute is changed  the scope  validity and enforceability of our patents may be significantly decreased 
there also have been  and continue to be  policy discussions concerning the scope of patent protection awarded to biotechnology inventions 
social and political opposition to patents on genes and proteins may lead to narrower patent protection  or narrower claim interpretation  for genes  their corresponding proteins and inventions related to their use  formulation and manufacture 
patent protection relating to biotechnology products is also subject to a great deal of uncertainty outside the united states  and patent laws are evolving and undergoing revision in many countries 
changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws worldwide may result in our inability to obtain or enforce patents  and may allow others to use our discoveries to develop and commercialize competitive products  which would impair our business 
we expect to incur significant expenses in applying for patent protection and prosecuting our patent applications 
our success depends significantly on the establishment of patent protection for the products and product candidates and related technologies 
consequently  we intend to continue our substantial efforts in applying for patent protection and prosecuting pending and future patent applications and maintaining patents 
these efforts have historically required the expenditure of considerable time and money  and we expect that they will continue to require significant expenditures 
we may fail to secure meaningful patent protection relating to any of our existing or future product candidates  discoveries or technologies despite the expenditure of considerable resources 
in addition  future changes in united states or foreign patent laws may complicate or hinder our efforts to obtain patent protection and may significantly increase the costs associated with patent prosecution 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our unpatented proprietary technology and information 
in addition to our patented intellectual property  we also rely on trade secrets and confidential information 
we may not be able to effectively protect our rights to such proprietary technology or information 
other parties may independently develop or gain access to equivalent technologies or information and disclose it for others to use 
disputes may arise about inventorship and corresponding rights to know how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our corporate partners  licensees  scientific and academic collaborators and consultants 
in addition  confidentiality agreements and material transfer agreements we have entered into with these parties and with employees and advisors may not provide effective protection of our proprietary technology or information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  may not provide adequate remedies 
environmental and health and safety laws may result in liabilities  expenses and restrictions on our operations 
state and federal laws and regulations and those of foreign jurisdictions regarding environmental protection  hazardous substances and human health and safety may adversely affect our business 
the use of hazardous substances in our operations exposes us to the risk of accidental releases 
if our operations  including those of our strategic partners  result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances  we could be liable for damages and fines 
future changes to environmental and health and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expenses or restrict our operations 
in addition  the site where our principal headquarters and facilities are located has been listed as a contaminated property by the state of washington due to its previous use by the city of seattle as an electricity generating plant 
the city of seattle has agreed to defend us against and indemnify us for any claims that arise from this pre existing contamination  except to the extent that we caused the claim through our negligence or intentional fault  or to the extent that we contributed to the contamination that is the subject of the claim  caused an increase in the clean up costs or failed to comply with our obligations under our agreement with the city of seattle 
this indemnity may be insufficient and we may be subject to environmental liabilities or be prohibited from using or occupying some or all of the property as a result of environmental claims 
natural or man made disasters may impair our ability to conduct our business 
while our headquarters and principal research and development operations are in seattle  washington  we also have partners  manufacturers  suppliers and distributors in various parts of the united states  europe and australia 
our facilities and those of our partners  manufacturers  suppliers or distributors may be subject to natural or man made disasters 
a natural or man made disaster could cause damage to our facility  personnel or equipment  which in turn  could cause us to cease or curtail operations 
our business and financial position may also be affected by disasters affecting the operations of one of our partners  manufacturers  suppliers or distributors 
disasters may include  but are not limited to earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  tsunamis  fires  floods  power loss  communication failures and other similar events  including the effects of war or acts of terrorism 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business could be seriously or completely impaired 
although we maintain insurance coverage for many of these types of risks  it may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
financial and market risks we anticipate incurring additional losses and may not achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses over the next several years  and we may never become profitable 
although we began generating recothrom sales revenue in  it will be a number of years before we generate revenues from sales of other potential products  if ever 
our revenues from the sales of recothrom and existing collaborative and licensing arrangements are currently insufficient to cover our operating expenses  and we may 
table of contents never generate revenues sufficient to cover these expenses 
in addition  we will continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research  development and commercialization efforts 
the development and commercialization of our product candidates will require significant further research  development  testing  regulatory approvals and sales and marketing activities  including  in the immediate future  pursuing the commercialization of recothrom 
we may not be able to complete such development or succeed in developing and commercializing products that will generate revenues that will justify the costs of development and commercialization 
we may incur substantial operating losses for at least the next few years as we continue to expand our commercial function in the immediate future for recothrom and our research and development activities for the other product candidates in our development pipeline 
these losses have had and will have an adverse effect on our shareholders equity and working capital 
even if we become profitable in the future  we may not remain profitable 
if we do not obtain substantial additional funding on acceptable terms  we may not be able to continue to grow our business or generate enough revenue to recover our investment in research and development 
our business does not currently generate the cash needed to finance our operations  and we do not expect it to in the near future 
we anticipate that we will continue to expend substantial funds on our research and development programs  the amount of which may increase in the future 
we expect to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  or through other arrangements  including collaborative and licensing arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms  especially in light of the current global economic crisis 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders will be diluted  and these securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our research or development or commercialization programs 
we may also be required to grant rights to third parties to develop  commercialize and market products and product candidates that we would prefer to develop  commercialize and market internally  and such rights may be granted on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we were required to grant such rights  the ultimate value of these products or product candidates to us would be reduced 
in addition  if our cash and cash equivalents drop below a certain level it may constitute an event of default under our june  facility agreement with deerfield private design fund  lp  deerfield private design international  lp and deerfield zg corporation 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
our revenues have been unpredictable and could fluctuate due to slow or erratic uptake of recothrom sales or the timing of licensing fees or the achievement of milestones under new or existing licensing and collaborative arrangements 
in addition  our expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenses  particularly with respect to collaborative cost sharing  contract manufacturing and clinical and nonclinical testing 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our past operating results are not good indicators of our future performance and should not be relied on to predict our future operating results 
it is possible that in the future our operating results in a particular quarter or quarters will not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing the market price of our common stock to decline  perhaps substantially 
we are exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
some of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and  even if they are not as a matter of contract  vendors may seek concessions in the event that their anticipated economic return is impaired by 
table of contents exchange rate fluctuations 
most of our existing foreign expenses are associated with the manufacture of recothrom  sharing of development costs with foreign partners or our global clinical studies 
we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates with europe 
when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies  the dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense increases  and when the dollar strengthens against other currencies  the dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense decreases 
consequently  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a weakening of the united states dollar  may adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently do not hedge against our foreign currency risks 
risks related to our industry many of our competitors have substantially greater capabilities and resources than we do and may be able to develop and commercialize products before we do or more effectively than we do 
we may be unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors 
we expect that competition in our field will continue to be intense 
recothrom and its line extensions  if any  will face substantial competition in the topical hemostat market from the current well established participants  including king pharmaceuticals  inc  ethicon  inc and baxter international  inc  as well as any future entrants into this market 
for our product candidates in development  we face competition from other entities involved in the research and development of therapeutic proteins  including genentech  inc  human genome sciences  inc  medarex  inc 
and biogen idec inc  among others 
we also face competition from entities developing other types of products related to particular diseases or medical conditions  including other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
furthermore  our potential products  if approved and commercialized  may compete against well established existing therapeutic protein based products  many of which may be currently reimbursed by government health administration authorities  private health insurers and health maintenance organizations 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial  scientific  marketing and human resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may succeed in identifying genes or proteins  or developing therapeutic protein based products  earlier than we do  obtain approvals for products from the fda or other regulatory agencies more rapidly than we do  obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates  develop treatments or cures that are safer or more effective than those we propose to develop  devote greater resources to marketing or selling their products  introduce or adapt more quickly to new technologies or scientific advances  which could render our discovery technologies obsolete  introduce products that make the continued development of our potential products uneconomical  withstand price competition more successfully than we can  more effectively negotiate third party collaborative or licensing arrangements  and take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily than we can 
because of these potential disadvantages  we may not be able to compete effectively with these competitors 

table of contents our products and product candidates  even if approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  may not achieve market acceptance among hospitals  insurers or patients 
our products and product candidates  even if approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  may fail to achieve market acceptance  which would impair our ability to become profitable 
we believe that market acceptance of our products and product candidates will depend on our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety  efficacy and limited side effects  our ability to provide these products and product candidates at reasonable prices  the availability of third party reimbursement for these products and product candidates  our ability to differentiate our products and compete effectively  including with products that are considered to be the standard of care  and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing capabilities 
if the healthcare system  reimbursement policies or any other healthcare related regulations change  the prices of our products and product candidates may fall or our potential sales may decline 
in recent years  officials have made numerous proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states 
these proposals include measures that would limit or prohibit payments for certain medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control 
government and other third party payers increasingly have attempted to control healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of newly approved healthcare products 
increasingly  third party payors have been challenging the prices charged for products 
they may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the fda has granted marketing approval 
the government may adopt future legislative proposals  such as price controls on prescription drugs  and federal  state or private payors for healthcare goods and services may take further action to limit payments for healthcare products and services 
in addition  in certain foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control with many of the same types of challenges as in the united states 
any of these factors could limit our ability to successfully commercialize our potential products 
we may face increased competition from lower priced products re imported into the united states from canada and other countries 
the current law  enacted in december  allows the importation of drugs from canada  but only if the secretary of health and human services certifies that importation will pose no additional risk to the public s health and safety 
to date  no such certifications have been given 
legislative proposals have been made to change the law to allow importation without any certification 
if this or other new legislation or regulations were passed allowing the reimportation of drugs  it could adversely affect the prices of our potential products 
in addition  there has been much discussion regarding the creation of laws permitting follow on or generic versions of biologics 
while there is not currently an abbreviated approval pathway for biologics as there is with branded drugs  congress and the fda are studying the issue and there is increasing interest from the public 
an abbreviated pathway for follow on biologics may permit the fda to rely on clinical data submitted by innovator developers like ourselves when evaluating applications filed by sponsors of follow on biologics and may not require full or any clinical trials  significantly lowering the risks and financial barriers to entry 
the approval of follow on biologics could result in new and increased competition  including competition prior to expiration of our patents covering our products  and related litigation 
product liability litigation could become more complex and problematic for us as courts may permit purchasers and users of follow on biologic products to pursue product liability claims against innovator companies  such as us  as has recently happened in the context of generic small molecule drugs 

table of contents negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic and clinical research may limit our ability to conduct our business 
ethical  social and legal concerns about genetic and clinical research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting some of our activities or the activities of our suppliers and collaborators 
in recent years  federal and state agencies  congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating the biotechnology industry 
more restrictive regulations could delay or complicate nonclinical studies or clinical trials  or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals or commercializing any products 
in addition  animal rights activists may protest our use of animals in research and development and may attempt to disrupt our operations  which could cause us to incur significant expenses and distract our management s attention from other business concerns 
the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and biologics is subject to extensive regulation and aggressive government enforcement  and our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations 
our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products will be subject to extensive regulation under the us federal food  drug and cosmetic act and other federal statutes and associated regulations 
these laws and regulations limit the types of marketing claims and other communications we can make regarding marketed products 
we are also subject to various us federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims laws 
anti kickback laws prohibit payments of any kind intended to induce physicians or others either to purchase or arrange for or recommend the purchase of healthcare products or services  including the selection of a particular prescription drug 
these laws make certain business practices that are relatively common in other industries illegal in our industry 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting  or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors  including medicare and medicaid  claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent 
the government has asserted very broad interpretations of these laws against pharmaceutical manufacturers  even though these manufacturers did not directly submit claims for reimbursement to government payors 
in addition  regulation is not static and regulatory authorities  including the fda  evolve in their staff  interpretations and practices and may impose more stringent requirements than currently in effect  which may adversely affect our sales and marketing efforts 
violations of the above laws may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including fines and civil monetary penalties  as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs  including medicare and medicaid 
many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have in recent years been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation  including claims asserting violations of the federal false claims act  the federal anti kickback statute  and other violations in connection with off label promotion of products  pricing  and government price reporting 
while we will strive to comply with these complex requirements  the interpretation of these laws as applied to particular sales and marketing practices continues to evolve  and it is possible that our sales and marketing practices might be challenged 
further  although we have taken measures to prevent potential challenges  including through our corporate compliance program  we cannot guarantee that such measures will protect us from future challenges  lawsuits or investigations 
even if such challenges are without merit  they could cause adverse publicity  divert management attention and be costly to respond to  and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  including impact on our stock price 
in addition  our strategic partners and licensees are required to comply with comparably complex requirements in jurisdictions outside the united states 
in order to sell recothrom to federal institutions  such as military hospitals and the veterans administration  we must satisfy the requirements of listing on the federal supply schedule and we are required to periodically report product pricing related information 
the calculations used to generate the pricing related information are complex 
if we fail to accurately and timely report product pricing related information or to comply with any of these or any other laws or regulations  various negative consequences could result  including criminal and or civil prosecution  substantial criminal and or civil penalties  exclusion of the approved product from coverage under governmental healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid  costly litigation and 
table of contents restatement of our financial statements 
in addition  our efforts to comply with this wide range of laws and regulations are  and will continue to be  time consuming and expensive 
risks related to ownership of our stock our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors beyond our control  including changes in the recommendations of securities analysts or changes in their financial estimates of our operating results  recommendations or opinions of journalists  media personalities or market commentators  failures in meeting performance expectations of securities analysts or investors  changes in the political climate and uncertainties about federal and state legislation  policies  and programs affecting health care and pharmaceuticals  fluctuations in the valuations of companies perceived by securities analysts or investors to be comparable to us  and share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares 
furthermore  the stock markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
in particular  there have been high levels of volatility in the market prices of securities of biotechnology companies 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations  may negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation due to our expected stock price volatility 
in the past  shareholders have often brought securities class action litigation against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially acute for us  because biotechnology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years  which increases the risk of substantial declines in stock price 
as a result  biotechnology companies have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
we may in the future be the target of securities class action litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs  could divert management s attention and resources  and could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our shareholders have significant control of our management and affairs  which they could exercise against other shareholders best interests 
novo nordisk  together with warburg pincus equity partners  lp  beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  representatives of these shareholders hold four out of nine seats on our board of directors pursuant to a shareholders agreement 
these shareholders  acting together  have the ability to significantly influence our management and affairs and matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of corporate strategy  significant corporate transactions  such as mergers  consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets 
consequently  these shareholders  acting together  may be able to cause a change in control  as well as delay or prevent a change in control 
they may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to effect a change in control  even if such a change in control would benefit our other shareholders 

table of contents provisions in washington law  our charter documents and executive employment agreements we have entered into may prevent  discourage or delay a change of control 
we are subject to the washington anti takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers  which  with limited exceptions  prohibit a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions for a period of five years after the share acquisition by an acquiring person  unless i the prohibited transaction or the acquiring person s purchase of shares was approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s board of directors prior to the acquiring person s share acquisition or ii the prohibited transaction was both approved by the majority of the members of the target corporation s board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two thirds of the outstanding voting shares excluding the acquiring person s shares at or subsequent to the acquiring person s share acquisition 
an acquiring person is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially owns or more of the voting securities of the target corporation 
such prohibited transactions include  among other things certain mergers or consolidations with  dispositions of assets to  or issuances of stock to or redemptions of stock from  the acquiring person  termination of or more of the employees of the target corporation as a result of the acquiring person s acquisition of or more of the shares  allowing the acquiring person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder  and liquidating or dissolving the target corporation 
after the five year period  certain significant business transactions are permitted  as long as they comply with certain fair price provisions of the statute or are approved by a majority of the outstanding shares other than those of which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership 
a corporation may not opt out of this statute 
as such  these laws could prohibit or delay mergers or a change of control and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions  such as undesignated preferred stock and prohibitions on cumulative voting in the election of directors  which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
also  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board  removal of directors generally only for cause and certain requirements for calling special shareholder meetings 
further  our bylaws require advance notice of shareholder proposals and nominations and impose restrictions on the persons who may call special shareholder meetings

r share based payment  was adopted effective january  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing therapeutic protein based products for the treatment of human diseases 
the process for taking one of our discoveries to the marketplace is long  complex and very costly 
it is difficult to predict the time it will take to reach the market with any given product candidate  but it would not be unusual to span ten years or more and cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
it is also a business of attrition  it is expected that  for the industry as a whole  less than of the drug candidates entering human clinical trials will actually make it to the marketplace 
for the products that do make it  particularly for those that address previously unmet medical needs  the markets can be significant  with a number of successful products selling in excess of billion per year 
in late  we began preparations for the commercial launch of our first product  recothrom  which was approved by the fda on january  in june  we entered into a global collaboration with bayer for development and commercialization of recothrom 
bayer has agreed to commercialize recothrom in countries outside the united states and will co promote the product with us in the united states for up to four years 
we have hired approximately field personnel and additional headquarters based personnel to support the commercial operations that are necessary for selling recothrom 
we are incurring substantial marketing costs to support the selling effort 
we are also building significant levels of inventory to meet the expected demand for the product and minimize the risk of product shortages 
these commercialization activities are utilizing substantial cash resources until such time as recothrom sales reach a level  if ever  that will cover our related costs 
we recorded net sales revenue of million in  and we anticipate significantly higher revenue generation from recothrom sales over time  however  we cannot be certain of the future rate of market penetration or when  if ever  our revenues will exceed our related costs 
an important element of our business strategy is that we intend to maintain a significant share of the commercial value for certain of our products under development 
as a result  we will be required to pay a significant portion of the development and commercialization costs for these products 
even if we decide to license a product candidate to another company  we will generally be required to pay research and development costs up to the point of licensing 
another important element of our strategy is that we maintain fully integrated research and development operations to enable us to discover new product candidates and advance them to the point where we can demonstrate clinical proof of concept 
these operations  although critical to our long term business strategy  are expensive to maintain and the level of output is uncertain 
substantial funding is required on an ongoing basis to maintain these operations 
generating the funding necessary to operate our business is challenging 
there are a number of potential sources of revenues and cash that we pursue in order to address our funding needs  including the following sales of recothrom  which were million in  net of all related discounts and allowances  research  development and commercialization collaborations  such as the ones we have entered into with bayer for recothrom and bristol myers squibb for peg interferon lambda peg ifn l  which provide revenues while also enabling us to reduce our ongoing research and development expenses  licensing of technologies or product candidates  such as atacicept and recombinant factor xiii  to other companies  which typically provide license fees and potential milestone payments and royalties on sales  issuance of equity or equity based securities  debt financing  such as the million financing arrangement we entered into with deerfield management in june  and investment income on our cash reserves 

table of contents we expect that it will be at least several years before we can generate enough product related revenues for our company to reach net income or cash flow breakeven  and we expect to continue to invest significant amounts of cash in developing our business 
we intend to pursue additional collaboration and license transactions as a means of generating additional cash and reducing our ongoing expenses 
these transactions may involve our product candidate il  currently in phase clinical trials  and our earlier stage candidates that have not yet begun clinical testing 
in addition  we expect to continue our efforts to reduce our operating cost structure 
in addition  it is possible that we will look for opportunities to raise capital by issuing equity or equity related securities  to help fund our company over the next several years 
these opportunities may arise at any time  depending on things such as overall market conditions  dynamics in the biotechnology sector of the market  investor appetite for certain types of companies  and fundamental characteristics of our business 
at other times  it may be difficult to raise capital on terms favorable to our company  if at all  especially in light of the current global economic crisis 
accordingly  we would expect to raise capital when it is available  not when there is an immediate need 
we believe this strategy is important to minimize the financial risks to our company and our shareholders 
results of operations revenues product sales 
the fda granted marketing approval of recothrom on january  for the  iu vial configuration and on may  for the  iu vial configuration  both with and without a spray kit 
sales of recothrom are recognized as revenue when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed 
product sales are recorded net of provisions for estimated discounts  rebates  chargebacks and returns 
we recognized net product sales revenue of million in we expect sales of recothrom to increase over the next several years as we penetrate the market further 
royalties 
we earn royalties on sales of certain products subject to license agreements with other companies 
royalties decreased slightly year to year in  and primarily due to insulin and glucagon patent expiration in most countries 
most of the effects of reduced insulin and glucagon royalties were offset by increasing minimum royalties earned on gem s  a product of biomimetic therapeutics  inc royalties are expected to be substantially less in as royalties from sales of gem s decrease  due to the discontinuation of minimum royalty obligations  and the expiration of our patent related to benefix  a product of wyeth pharmaceuticals  inc  in december collaborations and licenses 
we enter into various collaborative agreements that may generate significant license  option or other upfront fees with subsequent milestone payments earned upon completion of development milestones 
where we have no continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize these fees and payments as revenue when contractually due and payment is reasonably assured  as these payments represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
where we have continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized using one of two methods 
where we are able to estimate the total amount of costs we will incur under the arrangement  revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model 
costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs are used to determine proportional performance  as this is considered to be representative of the delivery of outputs under the arrangement 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to cash received and amounts contractually due 
changes in estimates of total expected performance are accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate 
where we cannot estimate the total amount of service that is to be provided  a time based method is used to recognize revenue 
under the time based method  revenue is recognized over the arrangement s estimated performance period  starting with the contract s commencement  but not before the removal of any contingencies for each milestone 
revenue recognition is determined based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the cash received and amounts contractually due 
from period to period  license fees and milestone payments can fluctuate substantially based 
table of contents on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements and the achievement of development related milestones 
on august   we amended the strategic alliance agreement with serono sa merck serono and simultaneously exercised our right under the atacicept collaborative development and marketing agreement to discontinue our co development and co funding obligations and convert our position to an exclusive milestone and royalty bearing license 
based on these actions  our responsibility for funding atacicept product development costs ended june  and all significant continuing obligations under the agreements will end in october since the agreements were negotiated in tandem  we are considering them as a single agreement for revenue recognition purposes 
we have recorded our share of the collaboration expenses from january  to august  of million as research and development expense 
additionally  as part of the amended agreements with merck serono  we do not have to pay for million of development costs that were previously required to be reimbursed to merck serono under the prior agreements 
these development costs were expensed as research and development costs in the period june  to august  the forgiveness of these expenses was determined to be consideration for the licenses granted to merck serono and therefore we have considered the million to be incremental revenue which is being deferred and recognized as license fee revenue on a straight line basis through october  our remaining obligated performance period under the strategic alliance agreement 
in june  we entered into license and collaboration and co promotion agreements with bayer 
the agreements provide bayer with an exclusive license to develop and sell recothrom outside of the united states and bayer will also promote recothrom in the united states for up to four years 
we will record all united states product sales revenue and bayer will be entitled to a commission on united states sales for five or six years  depending on how long they co promote recothrom in the united states 
we received a million upfront milestone payment in  and million in milestone payments in  million of which will be repaid to bayer as united states sales bonuses under the co promotion 
we are entitled to various other milestones based on regulatory filings  regulatory approvals and annual sales thresholds achieved by bayer outside of the united states 
these milestone payments will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue using the proportional performance model to the extent they are received during the remaining period in which we will fulfill our obligations under the agreements 
we currently anticipate completing these obligations in collaborations and licenses revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million as compared to the same period in the increase primarily resulted from license fees of million earned in october under our ig fusion agreement with bristol myers squibb and an increase in the recognition of license fees related to our recothrom agreements with bayer 
partially offsetting this increase were milestones earned in under our il and il agreements with novo nordisk for which no comparable amounts were earned in revenues from collaborations and licenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to recognition in of license fee revenue related to our recothrom agreements with bayer  milestone payment revenue from novo nordisk under our factor xiii  il and il agreements  and milestone payment revenue from merck serono under our atacicept and fgf agreements 
as of december   the deferred revenue related to the merck serono agreements and the bayer agreement was million and million  respectively 
we currently expect all of the remaining merck serono deferred revenue to be recognized in in addition  in january  we entered into a co development co promotion and license agreement with bristol myers squibb for the type interferon family  which includes our development candidate peg interferon lambda 
on february   the effective date  we became eligible to receive an initial license fee of million within days and will receive an additional license fee of million in march additionally  we expect to receive various milestone payments based on the achievement of certain objectives  including million expected later in related to the initiation of phase clinical trials  profit sharing and 
table of contents co promotion rights in the us  and may receive royalties on sales outside of the us we are also eligible for sales bonuses based on world wide sales of licensed products 
we provide a license to related technology and are obligated to fund the first million of costs for development in the us and europe  after which we will be responsible for of such costs 
we expect to record revenue related to the license fees and near term milestone payments over an approximately three year period  which corresponds to the period in which we will incur most of our costs and perform our obligations under the agreement 
costs and expenses costs of product sales 
costs of product sales were million in  following approval of recothrom january prior to fda approval of recothrom  all third party manufacturing costs and an allocation of our labor and overhead associated with the manufacturing of recothrom for commercial sale were expensed as research and development costs as incurred 
subsequent to approval  third party manufacturing costs and labor and overhead associated with the commercial manufacturing of recothrom are recorded as inventory 
accordingly  our costs of product sales will be reduced during the time we are selling product manufactured prior to approval  which included and will include all of costs of product sales include the inventory and distribution costs associated with recothrom product revenue 
additionally  we recorded a million charge to costs of product sales in for manufacturing costs incurred subsequent to fda approval for product that is expected to become obsolete 
research and development 
research and development expense has been our most significant expense to date  primarily consisting of salaries and benefit expenses  costs of consumables  contracted services and stock based compensation 
our research and development activities have generally expanded from year to year  particularly related to our recently approved commercial product  recothrom  and clinical stage product candidates  atacicept  il and peg ifn l 
however  this trend was reversed in following the approval of recothrom and a reduction in research and development headcount 
in each of the past three years  research and development expense was partially offset by cost reimbursements from our collaborators for work we performed on various development programs 
the breakdowns within major categories of research and development expense are shown in the following table in thousands salaries and benefits consumables facility costs contracted services depreciation and amortization stock based compensation subtotal cost reimbursement from collaborators net research and development expense salaries and benefits and consumables generally track with changes in our employee base from year to year 
the million decrease in salaries and benefits in and the corresponding decrease in consumables was due to the february termination of research and development employees and costs related to recothrom manufacturing being included in inventory costs subsequent to the january  fda approval of recothrom instead of being recorded as research and development expense 
the million increase in salaries and benefits in was attributable to an increase in research and development headcount 
contracted services include the cost of items such as contract research  contract manufacturing  clinical trials  non clinical studies and payments to collaborators 
these costs relate primarily to clinical development programs and can fluctuate substantially from period to period depending on the stage of our various programs 

table of contents generally  these external costs increase as a program advances toward commercialization  but there can be periods between major clinical trials or manufacturing campaigns during which costs decline 
contracted services decreased by million in due to reduced contract manufacturing costs  which decreased to million in as compared to million for the same period in  reflecting the discontinued expensing of pre approval manufacturing of rthrombin recothrom bulk drug and finished product inventory after fda approval in january this decrease was offset by other cost increases 
our clinical trial costs increased in as compared to  primarily reflecting the costs incurred for the atacicept lupus nephritis clinical trial that began in late payments to collaborators also increased for the same period primarily reflecting our portion of atacicept development costs under our collaboration with merck serono 
in august  we amended our collaboration with merck serono whereby merck serono will be responsible for all development costs associated with atacicept subsequent to august contracted services increased by million in due to increased contract manufacturing costs related to the manufacture of rthrombin bulk drug and finished product inventory and clinical trial material for il and atacicept 
our clinical trial costs slightly decreased in  as compared to the same period in  primarily reflecting the completion of rthrombin phase clinical trials prior to fda submission in late  partially offset by the increase in preparation costs associated with the atacicept lupus nephritis clinical trial 
to date  our business needs have not required us to fully allocate all research and development costs among our various programs 
however  we track direct labor  contracted services and certain consumable costs by program  which we monitor to ensure appropriate utilization of our company resources 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs 
these costs include indirect labor  certain consumable costs  facility costs and depreciation and amortization  all of which benefit all of our research and development programs 
the following table presents our research and development costs allocated to clinical development  preclinical and research programs  together with the unallocated costs that benefit all programs for the periods presented in thousands inception to date clinical development programs hemostasis autoimmunity and oncology antiviral preclinical and research programs unallocated indirect costs total the following summarizes the reasons for fluctuations in research and development program costs for the three years presented in the table hemostasis clinical development program factor xiii and rthrombin costs in reflected the conduct of process validation and manufacturing campaigns for rthrombin to support the filing of a license application with the fda in late the costs included approximately million of manufacturing costs incurred for rthrombin commercial product prior to fda approval on january  without these manufacturing related costs  the program costs would have substantially declined  reflecting the lower level of development activities while awaiting fda approval 
the reduction in costs from to reflect the discontinued expensing of recothrom manufacturing costs  which were included in inventory subsequent to fda approval on january  autoimmunity and oncology clinical development program atacicept and il costs increased from to primarily due to an increase in our share of atacicept joint development costs paid to merck serono 
costs increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in our share of costs related to the manufacturing of clinical material and clinical trial activity 
such increases were primarily related to evaluating atacicept for the treatment of lupus  rheumatoid arthritis and multiple 
table of contents sclerosis 
these costs are expected to decrease in the future due to the amended agreements with merck serono completed in august whereby merck serono is responsible for future development costs 
antiviral clinical development program costs have not changed significantly over the three years presented 
preclinical and research program costs were flat in as compared to the increase in costs from to reflected increased activity in new discovery programs 
unallocated indirect costs were consistent between and the increase in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense  which consists primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  professional fees and other corporate costs  increased in as compared to and in as compared to the increases were primarily due to the hiring of our sales force early in the third quarter of to support the launch and commercialization of recothrom in and then the increased sales and marketing activities throughout all of an increase in legal costs also contributed to the increase 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminated the election to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we determine fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
the following amounts of stock based compensation expense were recorded for the three years reported in thousands research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense total other income expense investment income 
investment income is generated primarily from investment of our cash reserves in investment grade  fixed income securities 
there are four primary factors affecting the amount of investment income that we report the amount of cash reserves invested  the effective interest rate  the amount of realized gains or losses on investments held during the period and the amount of other than temporary impairment recorded in the period 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to a lower average cash balance and effective interest rate  as well as realized losses on investments and an other than temporary loss on an investment security 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to a lower average cash balance 
the following table shows how each of these factors affected investment income for the three years reported in thousands weighted average amount of cash reserves effective interest rate investment income before gains losses net gain loss on investments other than temporary impairment loss investment income  as reported 
table of contents interest expense 
we have accounted for a sale leaseback transaction completed in october as a financing transaction 
under this method of accounting  an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale is considered a long term interest bearing liability 
rent payments under the leases are considered to be payments toward the liability and are allocated to principal and interest 
we recorded related interest expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  we recorded interest expense of  in related to the deerfield financing arrangement  which represents amortization of the deferred financing costs  including the fair value of the warrants issued  interest on the million drawn in november  and additional interest expense equal to of recothrom net sales in the us beginning upon receipt of the million draw 
gain on sale of fixed assets  net 
in august of  we sold undeveloped land near our corporate headquarters for million and recognized a gain of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which we intend to use to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
these cash reserves are held in a variety of fixed income securities  including corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments that were investment grade at the time of purchase 
subsequent to purchase  some asset backed securities see note of our audited financial statements have been downgraded by the major bond rating agencies 
together with the discretionary investment manager responsible for investing our portfolio  we monitor our investments closely and  based on market conditions and our expected working capital requirements  recorded other than temporary impairment loss of  on one security in the third quarter of we consider all other unrealized losses totaling million to be temporary 
in june  we completed a debt financing arrangement with deerfield management enabling us to draw up to million in million increments until january in november  we received our first draw of million 
interest accrues on amounts outstanding at a rate of per annum  compounded quarterly  and will be due  along with outstanding principal  in june each million draw entitles the lender to a royalty equal to of recothrom net sales in the us the cumulative royalty will not exceed million over the five year term of the arrangement assuming we draw the entire million 
in addition  we issued million in six year warrants upon receiving the initial draw in november and will issue an additional million warrants upon receipt of each additional draw 
we expect to fund our future operations using our existing cash resources  revenues from recothrom sales  and cash generated from existing and newly established collaborations and licenses 
in particular  the co development co promotion and license agreement with bristol myers squibb  executed in january see note of our audited financial statements  will provide million of committed funding in the first quarter of and million of contingent funding expected to be received in the second half of we believe that  together  these existing and anticipated cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations well beyond furthermore  we intend to pursue additional cost saving measures and opportunities to raise additional funds through new licenses and or collaboration transactions 
if the contingent funding under the bristol myers squibb agreement is not received as expected  we might need to access funding under the deerfield management financing arrangement 
these funds are contractually committed  however  if for some reason such funds were not available when requested  our continued operations beyond would be dependent upon the completion of new licenses  collaborations or financing transactions 
if these efforts were not successful  we could be required to significantly curtail our existing operations 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities the amount of cash used to fund our operating activities generally tracks our net losses  with the following exceptions noncash items  such as depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  amortization of deferred debt issue costs  gain or loss on sale or disposal of assets and stock based compensation  which do not result in uses of cash  net realized gains and losses and accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums on short term investments  which are reflected as sources of cash from investing activities upon maturity or sale of the respective investments  changes in receivables  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain revenues and the subsequent receipt of cash payments  additions to recothrom inventory subsequent to the january  approval date which reflect the use of cash but will not be expensed until the related product is sold  changes in deferred revenue  which reflect the difference in timing between the receipt of cash from option fees  license fees  other upfront payments and milestone payments  and the subsequent recognition of these amounts as revenue over the period we are contractually required to provide other rights or services that represent continuing obligations  and changes in other assets and liabilities  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses and their payment 
generally  with the exception of certain noncash items  changes in deferred revenue and recothrom inventory increases  we do not expect these items to generate material year to year fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of net cash used in operating activities 
substantial license or upfront fees may be received upon the date we enter into new licensing or collaborative agreements and be recorded as deferred revenue 
for example  we have received milestone payments from bayer related to the recothrom collaboration totaling million as of december   that have been recorded as deferred revenue and are being recognized as revenue through the first quarter of for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of previously deferred revenue relating to bayer and other collaborations 
the timing of additional deferred revenue transactions  including from the bristol myers squibb transaction in january  is expected to be irregular and  accordingly  has the potential to create fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of cash used in operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities our most significant use of cash in investing activities is for capital expenditures 
we expend a certain amount each year on routine items to maintain the effectiveness of our business  eg  to adopt newly developed technologies  expand into new functional areas  adapt our facilities to changing needs or replace obsolete assets 
in addition  we have used cash at various times to purchase land and expand facilities 
in august  we sold land that we purchased in and for million 
cash flows from investing activities also reflect large amounts of cash used to purchase short term investments and receipts from the sale and maturity of short term investments 
these amounts primarily relate to shifts between cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider movements in these investments to be important to an understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities in  we received million from our debt financing arrangement with deerfield and had related financing costs of million 
we can borrow up to an additional million through january and principle and accrued interest will be due in june in addition  we periodically receive proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
we expect to incur substantial additional losses in the coming years as we continue to build the market for recothrom and advance our pipeline candidates  such as peg ifn l 
we are optimistic regarding the long term commercial prospects for recothrom  however it might be quite some time  if ever  before our recothrom revenues enable us to achieve positive operating cash flow 
if at any time our prospects for funding our various initiatives decline  we may decide to look for ways to reduce our ongoing investment 
for instance  we might consider discontinuing our funding under existing co development arrangements  as we did with our atacicept collaboration with merck serono 
further  we may establish new co development arrangements for other product candidates to provide additional funding sources  as we did in early with our peg ifn l collaboration with bristol myers squibb 
also  we may out license products  product candidates or certain rights related to products or product candidates that we might otherwise choose to develop and commercialize internally 
additionally  we could consider delaying or discontinuing development of product candidates to reduce the level of our related expenditures 
in the first quarter of  subject to the closing of our collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb  we expect to receive million 
we expect to receive an additional million under the collaboration based on clinical progress expected later in until january  we have the ability to draw million of additional funding under our deerfield management funding arrangement  which is repayable in we expect these funds  together with our existing cash and investments  to cover our operating requirements for at least the next two years 
however  we may also seek additional funding through public or private financings  including debt or equity financings 
if any of these sources of funds are not available as we currently believe they will be  we may need additional funding sooner than we expect 
similarly  poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms  especially if the difficult economic conditions continue 
if we raise additional funds by issuing  equity or equity based securities including convertible debt  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders would be reduced  and these securities could have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our development programs  or grant rights to third parties to develop and market product candidates that we would prefer to develop and market internally  with license terms that are not favorable to us 
contractual obligations at december  we were contractually obligated to make payments as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years building lease obligations operating leases development contracts recothrom manufacturing contracts total the building lease obligations resulted from our sale leaseback financing transaction and run until may in addition  we entered into a noncancelable master lease agreement in march for office and 
table of contents parking space in a building near our corporate headquarters  which extended the lease term for all related leased space to april we have certain renewal provisions at our option  which are not reflected in the above table  for the building leases and the operating leases 
recothrom manufacturing contracts include the manufacture of rthrombin bulk drug and recothrom finished product for commercial sale 
critical accounting estimates royalty revenue we earn royalties on several products marketed by other companies 
royalties on these products are received within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we accrue estimated royalties at the end of each quarter based on historical sales data and the patent life associated with the product 
adjustments are made in the following quarter reflecting the difference between our estimates and actual reported royalties 
to date  these adjustments have not been significant 
license fees  milestone payments and upfront fees we enter into various collaborative agreements that generate significant license  option or other upfront fees with subsequent milestone payments earned upon completion of development milestones 
where we have no continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon receipt  as these payments represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
where we have continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized using one of two methods 
where we are able to estimate the total amount of services under the arrangement  revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model 
costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs are used to determine proportional performance  as this is considered to be representative of the delivery of outputs under the arrangement 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to cash received and amounts contractually due 
changes in estimates of total expected performance are accounted prospectively as a change in estimate 
where we cannot estimate the total amount of service that is to be provided  a time based method is used to recognize revenue 
under the time based method  revenue is recognized over the arrangement s estimated performance period  starting with the contract s commencement  but not before the removal of any contingencies for each milestone 
revenue recognition is determined based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period

furthermore  the market for options on our common stock is illiquid and cannot be relied upon as a source of implied volatility 
accordingly  we augmented our own data with the historical volatility and implied volatility of market traded options of similar companies 
the risk free interest rate used in the option valuation model is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options 
we estimated the expected life of our stock options using the simplified method for determining the expected term as prescribed by the sec s staff accounting bulletin  share based payment for the years and we used historical data to determine an estimate for the expected life of our stock options granted in we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk until recently  our exposure to market risk has been primarily limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  which may include united states government and agency securities  high grade united states corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial paper and money market funds 

table of contents in  due to deteriorating conditions in the debt markets  our exposure to market risk has increased and has impacted our investment portfolio 
overall liquidity for many debt issues has declined substantially  meaning that we may realize losses if we are required to liquidate securities upon short notice 
additionally  the credit quality of certain issues has declined substantially  causing ratings downgrades and in some cases uncertainty regarding the ability of issuers to repay principal amounts 
also  with respect to asset backed securities  overall economic conditions have generated concerns about the value of underlying assets held as collateral  and highlighted risks associated with insurance policies used to enhance the credit of the related debt issues 
to date  we have not experienced defaults on any of our investment securities 
we continue to monitor our investments closely and  based on market conditions  recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of  on one security in the third quarter of we have reviewed our investments as of december   and at this time do not believe that any additional other than temporary impairment loss is warranted 
we have no material foreign currency exposure  nor do we hold derivative financial instruments
