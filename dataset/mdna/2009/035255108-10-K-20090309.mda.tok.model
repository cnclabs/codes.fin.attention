the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we monitor our estimates on an on going basis for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
product revenue we recognize revenue from the sales of products we manufacture upon confirmation of regulatory compliance and shipment to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed or collected prior to recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenue 
when determining whether risk of loss has transferred to customers on product sales or if the sales price is fixed or determinable we evaluate both the contractual terms and conditions of our distribution and supply agreements as well as our business practices 
product revenue also includes royalties 
royalties earned are recorded as product revenue and is based on our distributor s sales and recognized in the same period our distributor records their sale of the product 
licensing  milestone and contract revenue licensing  milestone and contract revenue consists of revenue recognized on initial and milestone payments  as well as contractual amounts received from partners 
the company s business strategy 
table of contents includes entering into collaborative license  development and or supply agreements with partners for the development and commercialization of the company s products 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones  supply of products and royalties on product sales 
the company evaluates each agreement and elements within each agreement in accordance with eitf under eitf  in order to account for an element as a separate unit of accounting  the element must have stand alone value and there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
in general  non refundable upfront fees and milestone payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations 
reserve for obsolete excess inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review our inventories and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on certain factors that may impact the realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  inventory cycle time  regulatory requirements and significant changes in our cost structure 
if ultimate usage varies significantly from expected usage or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write down or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we generally produce finished goods based upon specific orders or in anticipation of specific orders 
as a result  we generally do not establish reserves against finished goods 
we evaluate the value of inventory on a quarterly basis and may  based on future changes in facts and circumstances  determine that a write down of inventory is required in future periods 
fair value measurements 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 for our financial assets and liabilities 
our adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in accordance with fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp fas  we elected to defer until january  the adoption of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting fsp fas sfas no 
establishes a three level hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
in general  fair value determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability  and includes situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
the fair value  level  of our cash equivalents was  at december  asset valuation 
asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  investments  inventories  and intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience  and the age of the receivable 
the determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held  market conditions  length of the impairment  magnitude of the impairment and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired 
the recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held and forecasted demand 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual recovery could be less than our estimate 
intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected 
table of contents period the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  and customer demand 
our intangible asset consists of our elevess trade name 
significant assumptions underlying the recoverability of the intangible asset include future cash flow  growth projections  product life cycle and useful life assumptions 
the ultimate recoverability of the asset is dependent on us securing additional distributors  or directly commercializing the product 
recoverability of the carrying value of the asset may also be impacted by the outcome of the pending trade name opposition 
changes in these assumptions could materially impact the company s ability to realize the value of its intangible asset 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on our pending trade name opposition 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation  subject to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
costs of major additions and improvements are capitalized  maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets are charged to operations 
on disposal  the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life or the expected term of the respective lease 
machinery and equipment are depreciated from to years  furniture and fixtures from to years and computer software and hardware from to years 
interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 capitalization of interest costs sfas 
the interest is capitalized until the underlying asset is ready for its intended use  at which point the interest cost is amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying assets 
we capitalize certain direct and incremental costs associated with the validation effort related to fda approval of our manufacturing facility and equipment for the production of our commercial products 
these costs include construction costs  equipment costs  direct labor and materials incurred in preparing the facility and equipment for their intended use 
the validation costs are amortized over the life of the related facility and equipment 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  sfas r share based payment  which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
for awards with a performance condition vesting feature  when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable  the company recognizes compensation cost on a graded vesting basis over the awards expected vesting periods 
the company assesses probability on a quarterly basis 
the company estimates the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights using the black scholes valuation model 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award  the expected award term  the expected volatility of the company s stock over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the award s expected term  and the company s expected annual dividend yield 
the company uses historical data on exercise of stock options and other factors to estimate the expected term of share based awards 
the company also evaluates forfeitures periodically and adjusts accordingly 
the expected volatility assumption is based on the unadjusted historical volatility of the company s common stock 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on us treasury interest rates at the time of grants 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards 

table of contents income taxes 
beginning january   the company began accounting for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  no benefit will be recorded 
uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold 
as a result of the adoption of fin there was no change to the tax reserve for unrecognized tax benefits 
as such  there was no change to retained earnings as of january  it is the company s policy to classify accrued interest and penalties as part of the accrued fin liability and record the expense in the provision for income taxes 
as of december   income tax related interest and penalties were immaterial 
our us federal income tax returns for the years through remain subject to examination  and our state income tax returns for and remain subject to examination 
we record a deferred tax asset or liability based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to be in effect when these differences reverse 
as of december   management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and  therefore  a valuation allowance has not been recorded

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to date  we have limited commitments for purchases of inventories 
we have incurred significant capital investments related to the buildout of our new facility in bedford  massachusetts 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the success and sales of our products under current and future distribution agreements  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  any potential acquisitions of products  technologies or businesses

we cannot assure you that we will record profits in future periods 
to the extent that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners  or through other sources 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
however  we believe that based on our current strategy  our cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash flows requirements beyond see item a 
risk factors 
the terms of any future equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants  which could limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing may be made available to us or may be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise
