item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with pinnacle west s consolidated financial statements and aps financial statements and the related notes that appear in item of this report 
overview pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps 
aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides retail and wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area  the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 
aps has historically accounted for a substantial part of our revenues and earnings  and is expected to continue to do so 
while customer growth in aps service territory has been an important driver of our revenues and earnings  it has significantly slowed  reflecting recessionary economic conditions both nationally and in arizona 
customer growth averaged a year for the three years through we currently expect customer growth and retail electricity sales growth excluding the effects of weather variations to average about per year during through we currently project that our customer growth will begin to accelerate as the economy recovers 
the near term economic conditions are reflected in the recent volatility and disruption of the credit markets  as discussed in detail under liquidity and capital resources pinnacle west consolidated below 
despite these conditions  pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and have been able to access these facilities  ensuring adequate liquidity for each company 
our cash flows and profitability are affected by the electricity rates aps may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates 
aps retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc 
aps capital expenditure requirements  which are discussed below under liquidity and capital resources pinnacle west consolidated  are substantial because of increased costs related to environmental compliance and controls and system reliability  as well as continuing  though slowed  customer growth in aps service territory 
aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate financial health 
see factors affecting our financial outlook below 
on march   aps filed a rate case with the acc  which it updated on june   requesting  among other things  an increase in retail rates to help defray rising infrastructure costs  approval of an impact fee and approval of new conservation rates 
see note for details regarding this rate case  including the acc s approval of an interim base rate surcharge pending the outcome of the case 
the and financial results of suncor  our real estate subsidiary  reflect the weak real estate market and current economic conditions  which have adversely affected suncor s ability to access capital 
suncor s net loss in included a million pre tax real estate impairment charge 
if conditions in the broader economy or the real estate markets worsen  or as a result of a change in suncor s strategy  we may be required to record additional impairments see note 
in addition to suncor s secured revolver  under which approximately million in borrowings were outstanding at december   suncor had approximately million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities that mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants 
the majority of this indebtedness  except for the secured revolver  is due in  and suncor is in the process of renegotiating these facilities 
if suncor is unable to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities  suncor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of cross default provisions 
such a debt acceleration would have a material adverse impact on suncor s business and its financial position 
the company has not guaranteed any suncor indebtedness 
as a result  the company does not believe that suncor s inability to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on pinnacle west s cash flows or liquidity  although any resulting suncor losses would be reflected in pinnacle west s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our other principal first tier subsidiaries  el dorado and apses  are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results  or to require any material amounts of capital  over the next three years 
we continue to focus on solid operational performance in our electricity generation and delivery activities 
in the delivery area  we focus on superior reliability and customer satisfaction 
we plan to expand long term energy resources and our transmission and distribution systems to meet the electricity needs of our growing retail customer base and to sustain reliability 
see factors affecting our financial outlook below for a discussion of several factors that could affect our future financial results 
pinnacle west consolidated earnings contribution by business segment pinnacle west s two reportable business segments are our regulated electricity segment  which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses primarily electric service to native load customers and related activities and includes electricity generation  transmission and distribution  and our real estate segment  which consists of suncor s real estate development and investment activities

all other revenues all other revenues were million lower for the year ended december  compared with the prior year primarily because of planned reductions of marketing and trading activities

all other revenues other revenues were million higher for the year ended december  compared with the prior year primarily as a result of increased sales by apses of energy related products and services 
liquidity and capital resources pinnacle west consolidated cash flows the following table presents net cash provided by used for operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and dollars in millions 
table of contents net cash flow provided by operating activities net cash flow used for investing activities net cash flow provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared with the increase of approximately million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to lower current income taxes  lower real estate investments resulting from the weak real estate market  and increased retail revenue related to higher base fuel rates  partially offset by increased collateral and margin cash provided as a result of changes in commodity prices 
the decrease of approximately million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to a real estate commercial property sale in  lower levels of capital expenditures see table and discussion below  and increased contributions in aid of construction related to changes in in aps line extension policy see note  partially offset by lower cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investment securities 
the decrease of approximately million in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the use of the proceeds from the sale of a real estate commercial property to pay down long term debt in  partially offset by higher levels of short term debt borrowings 
compared with the increase of approximately million in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in in the amount of cash collateral and margin cash returned to counterparties as a result of changes in commodity prices 
the increase of approximately million in net cash used for investing activities is primarily due to the proceeds of million received in from the sale of silverhawk and an increase in cash used for capital expenditures and capitalized interest see table and discussion below  partially offset by higher cash proceeds from the net sales and purchases of investments 
the increase of approximately million in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to higher levels of short term borrowings  partially offset by a decrease in net new long term debt issuances net of redemptions and refinancing 
liquidity capital expenditure requirements the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for  and and estimated capital expenditures  net of contributions in aid of construction  for the next three years 
table of contents capital expenditures dollars in millions actual estimated aps distribution generation a transmission other b subtotal suncor c other total a generation includes nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately million to million per year for  and b primarily information systems and facilities projects 
c consists primarily of capital expenditures for residential  land development and retail and office building construction reflected in real estate investments and capital expenditures on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
distribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades  capital replacements  new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs 
examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines  substations  line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems  partially offset by contributions in aid of construction in accordance with aps line extension policy 
generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements to aps existing fossil and nuclear plants 
examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions  upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines  boilers and environmental equipment 
environmental expenditures differ for each of the years  and  with the lowest year estimated at approximately million  and the highest year estimated at approximately million 
we are also monitoring the status of certain environmental matters  which  depending on their final outcome  could require modification to our environmental expenditures 
see business of arizona public service company environmental matters epa environmental regulation regional haze rules and environmental matters epa environmental regulation mercury in item in early  we announced and began implementing a cost reduction effort that included the elimination of approximately million of capital expenditures for the years these capital expenditure reductions are reflected in the estimates provided above 
due primarily to our reduced customer growth outlook as well as the deferral of upgrades and other capital projects  we have identified additional capital expenditure reductions of over million at aps net of the 
table of contents change in amounts collected for projected line extensions over the years these reductions are across all areas distribution  generation  transmission and general plant  and are reflected in the estimates provided above 
see pinnacle west consolidated factors affecting our financial outlook customer and sales growth below for additional information on our growth outlook 
capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and or external financings  which may include issuances of long term debt and pinnacle west common stock 
pinnacle west parent company our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our long term debt 
the level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  payout ratio trends  free cash flow and financial market conditions 
on january   the pinnacle west board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share of common stock  payable on march   to shareholders of record on february  our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps  external debt and equity financings and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries  primarily suncor 
for the years through  total distributions from aps were million and total distributions received from suncor were million 
for  cash distributions from aps were million and there were no distributions from suncor 
an existing acc order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least and prohibits aps from paying common stock dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold 
as defined in the acc order  the common equity ratio is common equity divided by the sum of common equity and long term debt  including current maturities of long term debt 
at december   aps common equity ratio  as defined  was approximately 
the credit and liquidity markets experienced significant stress beginning the week of september  while pinnacle west s and aps ability to issue commercial paper has been negatively impacted by the market stress  they have both been able to access existing credit facilities  ensuring adequate liquidity 
cash on hand is being invested in money market funds consisting of us treasury and government agency securities and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by us treasury and government agency securities 
at december   pinnacle west s outstanding long term debt  including current maturities  was million 
pinnacle west has a million revolving credit facility that terminates in december credit commitments totaling approximately million from lehman brothers are no longer available due to its september bankruptcy filing 
the remaining million revolver is available to support the issuance of up to million in commercial paper see discussion above or to be used as bank borrowings  including issuances of letters of credit of up to million 
at december   pinnacle west had outstanding million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility and approximately million of letters of credit 
pinnacle west had no commercial paper outstanding at december  in general  the company and aps have been unable to access the commercial paper markets since september at december   pinnacle west had remaining capacity available 
table of contents under its revolver of approximately million and had cash and investments of approximately million 
pinnacle west sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan and a non qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of pinnacle west and our subsidiaries 
irs regulations require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan 
we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations  but no more than the maximum tax deductible amount 
the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of plan assets and our pension obligation 
the assets in the plan are comprised of fixed income  equity and short term investments 
future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions 
we contributed million to our pension plan in on a cash funded basis  which is based on internal revenue code regulations  our preliminary estimate of the qualified plan s funded status market value of assets to liabilities as of january  is 
the plan s irs cash funded status was as of january  most of the increase from the prior year was due to gains in the long duration bonds and interest rate swaps that we utilized in to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan s assets to that of the plan s liabilities 
the required minimum contribution to our pension plan is estimated to be approximately million in and approximately million in the expected contribution to our other postretirement benefit plans in is estimated to be approximately million 
aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the contributions 
aps share is approximately of both plans 
see note for information regarding pinnacle west s approval from the acc regarding a potential equity infusion into aps of up to million 
in may  pinnacle west infused approximately million of equity into aps  consisting of proceeds of stock issuances in under pinnacle west s investors advantage plan direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock plans 
aps aps capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and mandatory redemptions of long term debt 
aps pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and  to the extent necessary  equity infusions from pinnacle west and external financings 
aps has historically paid its dividends to pinnacle west with cash from operations 
see pinnacle west parent company above for a discussion of the common equity ratio that aps must maintain in order to pay dividends to pinnacle west 
aps outstanding long term debt  including current maturities  was approximately billion at december  aps has two committed revolving credit facilities totaling million  of which million terminates in december and million terminates in september credit commitments totaling about million from lehman brothers are no longer available due to its september bankruptcy filing 
the remaining million is available either to support the issuance of up to million in commercial paper or to be used for bank borrowings  including issuances of letters of credit up to million 
at december   aps had borrowings of approximately million and no letters of credit under its revolving lines of credit 
aps had no commercial paper outstanding at december  in general  the company and aps have been unable to access the commercial paper markets since september at december   aps had remaining capacity available under its revolvers of million and had cash and investments of approximately million 

table of contents the interest rates on eleven issues of aps pollution control bonds  in the aggregate amount of approximately million  are reset every seven days through auction processes 
these bonds are supported by bond insurance policies provided by ambac  and the interest rates on the bonds can be directly affected by the rating of the bond insurer 
certain bond insurers  including ambac  have had downgrades of their credit ratings 
downgrades of bond insurers result in downgrades of the insured bonds  which increases the possibility of a failed auction and results in higher interest rates during the failed auction periods 
when auctions of aps bonds fail  the aps bondholders receive the maximum annual interest rate for the week of the failed auction 
for the twelve months ended december   we had ninety nine failed auctions  which represented about of all of our auctions 
the average interest rate at december  on the auction rate securities was 
bond auctions continued to fail through mid january  however  since that time  we have had only one failure 
the average interest rate at february  on the auction rate securities was 
we continue to closely monitor this market and  if market and business conditions allow  we are planning on refunding and reissuing these bonds during we do not expect  however  that our auction rate interest exposure will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 
on september   aps repurchased at par two series of pollution control bonds that had no credit enhancements 
the repurchase included million of its series a coconino county pollution control bonds and million of its series a coconino county pollution control bonds 
aps borrowed funds under its revolving lines of credit to re purchase the bonds as permitted under the bond indenture 
aps intends to keep the million outstanding until we complete our planned refunding and reissuance of these bonds  if market and business conditions allow  in although provisions in aps articles of incorporation and acc financing orders establish maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that aps may issue  aps does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements 
on october   the acc issued a financing order in which it approved aps request  subject to specified parameters and procedures  to increase a aps short term debt authorization from of aps capitalization to i of aps capitalization plus ii million which is required to be used for purchases of natural gas and power and b aps long term debt authorization from approximately billion to billion in light of the projected growth of aps and its customer base and the resulting projected financing needs 
this financing order expires december   however  all debt previously authorized and outstanding on december  will remain authorized and valid obligations of aps 
other financing matters see note for information regarding the psa approved by the acc 
although aps defers actual retail fuel and purchased power costs on a current basis  aps recovery of the deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and  if necessary  periodic psa adjustments 
see note s for information regarding an acc order permitting pinnacle west to infuse up to million of equity into aps  on or before december   if pinnacle west deems it appropriate to do so to strengthen or maintain aps financial integrity 
see cash flow hedges in note for information related to the change in our margin account 
other subsidiaries suncor the weak real estate market and current economic conditions have adversely affected suncor s financial results and its ability to access capital 
during the past three years  
table of contents suncor funded its cash requirements with cash from operations and its own external financings 
suncor s capital needs consist primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office building construction 
see the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures during and projected capital expenditures for the next three years 
suncor s principal loan facility  the secured revolver  is secured primarily by an interest in land  commercial properties  land contracts and homes under construction 
on february   suncor and the secured revolver lenders extended the maturity date of the secured revolver to january  classified as current maturities of long term debt at december  
suncor is required to repay amounts under the secured facility in order to reduce the lenders commitments to a balance of million by december  the secured revolver requires compliance with certain loan covenants pertaining to debt to net worth  debt service  liquidity  cash flow coverage and restrictions on debt 
in addition to the secured revolver  at december   suncor had approximately million of outstanding debt under other credit facilities that mature at various dates and also contain certain loan covenants 
the majority of this indebtedness is due in  and suncor is in the process of renegotiating these facilities 
if suncor is unable to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities  suncor could be required to immediately repay its outstanding indebtedness under all of its credit facilities as a result of cross default provisions 
such a debt acceleration would have a material adverse impact on suncor s business and its financial position 
the company has not guaranteed any suncor indebtedness 
as a result  the company does not believe that suncor s inability to meet its financial covenants under the secured revolver or its other outstanding credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on pinnacle west s cash flows or liquidity  although any resulting suncor losses would be reflected in pinnacle west s consolidated financial statements 
suncor entered into a secured construction loan on april   in the amount of million which was subsequently repaid in june on july   suncor borrowed million under a new secured construction loan 
the loan matures on july   and may be extended annually up to two years 
suncor s total outstanding debt was approximately million as of december   including million of debt classified as current maturities of long term debt under revolving lines of credit totaling million 
suncor s long term debt  including current maturities  was million and total short term debt was million at december  see notes and suncor had cash and investments of approximately million at december  el dorado el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 
apses apses expects minimal capital expenditures over the next three years 
debt provisions pinnacle west s and aps debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include debt to capitalization ratios 
certain of aps bank financing arrangements also include an interest coverage test 
pinnacle west and aps comply with these covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet these and other significant covenant requirements 
for both pinnacle west and aps  these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total 
table of contents consolidated capitalization not exceed 
at december   the ratio was approximately for pinnacle west and for aps 
the provisions regarding interest coverage require minimum cash coverage of two times 
the interest coverage was approximately times under aps bank financing agreements as of december  failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which  generally speaking  would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross default other debt 
see further discussion of cross default provisions below 
neither pinnacle west s nor aps financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade 
however  our bank financial agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest costs we pay are determined by our current credit ratings 
all of pinnacle west s loan agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements 
all of aps bank agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under certain other material agreements 
pinnacle west and aps do not have a material adverse change restriction for revolver borrowings 
see note for further discussions 
credit ratings the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february  are shown below 
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies  from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained 
there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if  in their respective judgments  circumstances so warrant 
any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west s or aps securities and serve to increase the cost of and limit access to capital 
it may also require substantial additional collateral related to certain derivative instruments  natural gas transportation  fuel supply  and other energy related contracts

off balance sheet arrangements in  aps entered into agreements with three separate vie lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap 
we are not the primary beneficiary of the palo verde vies and  accordingly  do not consolidate them see note 
aps is exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur 
under certain circumstances for example  the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events  aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions  make specified payments to the equity participants  and take title to the leased unit interests  which  if appropriate  may be required to be written down in value 
if such an event had occurred as of december   aps would have been required to assume approximately million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately million 
guarantees and letters of credit we have issued parental guarantees and letters of credit and obtained surety bonds on behalf of our subsidiaries 
our parental guarantees for pinnacle west marketing trading relate to commodity energy products 
as required by arizona law  pinnacle west has also obtained a million bond on behalf of aps in connection with the interim base rate surcharge approved by the acc in december see general rate case interim rate surcharge in note our credit support instruments enabled apses to offer energy related products and commodity energy 
non performance or non payment under the original contract by our subsidiaries would require us to perform under the guarantee or surety bond 
no liability is currently recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to pinnacle west s current outstanding guarantees on behalf of our subsidiaries 
at december   we had no guarantees that were in default 
our guarantees have no recourse or collateral provisions to allow us to recover amounts paid under the guarantees 
we generally agree to indemnification provisions related to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements  with limited exceptions depending on the particular agreement

e future pension contributions are not determinable for plan years and beyond 
this table excludes million in unrecognized tax benefits because the timing of the future cash outflows in uncertain 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties  judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

table of contents regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators  such as the acc and the ferc  to be reflected in our financial statements 
their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings 
a major component of our regulatory assets is the retail fuel and power costs deferred under the psa 
aps defers for future rate recovery of the difference between actual retail fuel and power costs and the amount of such costs currently included in base rates 
we had million  including million related to the psa  of regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets at december  also included in the balance of regulatory assets at december  is a regulatory asset of million in accordance with sfas no 
for pension and other postretirement benefits 
this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings 
if these costs are disallowed by the acc  this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 
in addition  we had million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december   which primarily are related to removal costs 
see notes and for more information 
pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term  and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the december  reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our reported pension expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on pinnacle west s consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

see note for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
our evaluation of these rules  as they apply to our contracts  determines whether we 
table of contents use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
see market risks commodity price risk below for quantitative analysis 
see fair value measurements below for additional information on valuation 
see note for discussion on accounting policies and note for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 
fair value measurements we apply fair value measurements to derivative instruments  nuclear decommissioning trusts and cash equivalents 
we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  for our financial assets and liabilities on january  sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas no 
establishes criteria to be considered when measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in accordance with sfas no 
we use inputs  or assumptions that market participants would use  to determine fair market value  and the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in the fair value hierarchy 
we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment 
our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value 
see note for further fair value measurement discussion  note for discussion on accounting policies and note for a further discussion on derivative and energy trading accounting 
our nuclear decommissioning trusts invest in fixed income securities and equity securities 
the fair values of these securities are based on observable inputs for identical or similar assets 
see note for further discussion of our nuclear decommissioning trusts 
real estate investment impairments we had real estate investments of million and home inventory of million on our consolidated balance sheets at december  we assess impairment of these assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for purposes of evaluating impairment  we classify our real estate assets  such as land under development  land held for future development  and commercial property  as held and used 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of real estate assets considered held and used may not be recoverable  we compare the undiscounted cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  we adjust the asset to fair value and recognize an impairment charge 
the adjusted value becomes the new book value carrying amount for held and used assets 
we may have real estate assets classified as held and used with fair values that are lower than their carrying amounts  but are not deemed to be impaired because the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying amounts 
real estate home inventory is considered to be held for sale for the purposes of evaluating impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
home inventories are reported at 
table of contents the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value less cost to sell is evaluated each period to determine if it has changed 
losses and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount 
we determine fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimate will be generated by each asset discounted for market risk 
our impairment assessments and fair value determinations require significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices  future construction and land development costs  future sales timing  and discount rates 
the assumptions are specific to each project and may vary among projects 
the discount rates we used to determine fair values at december  ranged from to 
due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process  with regard to impairments  it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates 
if conditions in the broader economy or the real estate markets worsen  or as a result of a change in suncor s strategy  we may be required to record additional impairments

table of contents factors affecting our financial outlook factors affecting operating revenues  fuel and purchased power costs general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale power markets in the western united states 
for the years through  retail electric revenues comprised approximately of our total electric operating revenues 
our electric operating revenues are affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer growth  variations in weather from period to period  customer mix  average usage per customer  electricity rates and tariffs and the recovery of psa deferrals 
off system sales of excess generation output  purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps retail customers through the psa 
these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess economic generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions  including demand and prices 
competitive retail sales of energy and energy related products and services are made by apses in certain western states that have opened to competition 
rate proceedings our cash flows and profitability are affected by the rates aps may charge and the timely recovery of costs through those rates 
aps retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc 
aps capital expenditure requirements  which are discussed below under liquidity and capital resources pinnacle west consolidated  are substantial because of environmental compliance and controls  system reliability  and continuing  though slowed  customer growth in aps service territory 
aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate financial health 
on march   aps filed a rate case with the acc  which it updated on june   requesting  among other things  an increase in retail rates to help defray rising infrastructure costs  approval of an impact fee and approval of new conservation rates 
see note for details regarding this rate case  including the acc s approval of an interim base rate surcharge pending the outcome of the case 
fuel and purchased power costs fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes  existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel  our power plant performance  transmission availability or constraints  prevailing market prices  new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas  our hedging program for managing such costs and  since april   psa deferrals and the amortization thereof 
see note for information regarding the psa 
aps recovery of psa deferrals from its ratepayers is subject to annual and  if necessary  periodic psa adjustments 
customer and sales growth the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply to native load customers and sales to them 
customer growth in aps service territory was during customer growth averaged a year for the three years through we currently expect customer growth to decline  averaging about per year for through due to factors reflecting the economic conditions both nationally and in arizona 
for the three years through  aps actual retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours grew at an average annual rate of  adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations  such retail sales growth averaged a year 
we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will grow on average per year during through  excluding the effects of weather variations 
we currently expect our retail sales growth in to be below average because of potential effects on customer usage from the economic conditions mentioned above and retail rate increases see note 

table of contents actual sales growth  excluding weather related variations  may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors  such as economic conditions  customer growth  usage patterns and responses to retail price changes 
our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
weather in forecasting retail sales growth  we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data 
historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of million 
however  our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
wholesale market our marketing and trading activities focus primarily on managing aps risks relating to fuel and purchased power costs in connection with its costs of serving native load customer demand 
our marketing and trading activities include  subject to specified parameters  marketing  hedging and trading in electricity and fuels 
see formula transmission tariff in note for information regarding aps recent filing with the ferc requesting a change to the formula rate 
other factors affecting financial results operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth  power plant operations  maintenance of utility plant including generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  inflation  outages  higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  and changes in depreciation and amortization rates 
see capital expenditures above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities 
property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes  which are affected by the value of property in service and under construction  assessment ratios  and tax rates 
the average property tax rate for aps  which currently owns the majority of our property  was of the assessed value for  of the assessed value for and of assessed value for we expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plant including new generation  transmission and distribution facilities and as we improve our existing facilities 
see capital expenditures above for information regarding planned additions to our facilities 
interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt 
see note the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures  long term debt maturities  and internally generated cash flow 
capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction 
we stop accruing capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 
climate change recent concern over climate change could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes  emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades 
the timing and type of compliance measures and related costs are impacted by current and future regulatory and legislative actions  which we are closely monitoring 
see business of arizona public service company climate change in item for more information regarding climate change initiatives 

table of contents retail competition although some very limited retail competition existed in arizona in and  there are currently no active retail electric service providers providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps customers 
we cannot predict when  and the extent to which  additional electric service providers will re enter aps service territory 
subsidiaries suncor s net loss was approximately million in suncor s net loss in included a million pre tax real estate impairment charge

our energy risk management committee  consisting of officers and key management personnel  oversees company wide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies 
we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives  including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards  options and swaps 
as part of our risk management program  we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities
