general martek was founded in we are a leader in the innovation and development of high value nutritional products from microbial sources  including algae  fungi and other microbes  that promote health and wellness 
our innovation and development is based on our core expertise  broad experience and proprietary technology in areas such as microbial biology  algal genomics  fermentation and oil processing 
we refer to this set of complementary abilities as martek s research engine 
through this research engine  we have developed and commercialized life sdha  a vegetarian source of the omega fatty acid dha docosahexaenoic acid  for use in infant formula  pregnancy and nursing products  foods and beverages  dietary supplements and animal feed 
we also produce life sara  a vegetarian source of the omega fatty acid ara arachidonic acid  for use in infant formula 
we sell oils containing these fatty acids as life sdha  dhasco  neuromins  arasco and life sara 
we derive dha from microalgae and ara from fungi  using proprietary processes 
cell membranes throughout the body contain these fatty acids  and they are particularly concentrated in the brain  central nervous system  retina and heart 
research has shown that dha and ara may enhance mental and visual development in infants 
in addition  research has shown that dha may play a pivotal role in brain function throughout life and may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease 
low levels of dha in adults have been linked to a variety of health risks  including alzheimer s disease  dementia  cardiovascular problems and various other neurological and visual disorders 
further research is underway to assess the role of supplementation with our dha on mitigating a variety of health risks 
in  we realized our first revenues from license fees related to our nutritional oils containing dha and ara and sales of sample quantities of these oils 
in  we recognized our first product and royalty revenues from sales of infant formula containing these oils  and in we began to realize revenues from the sale of neuromins  a dha dietary supplement 
in  the fda completed a favorable review of our generally recognized as safe notification for the use of our dha and ara oil blend in specified ratios in infant formula 
we are supplying over infant formula customers with our nutritional oils 
these companies collectively represent approximately of the estimated billion worldwide retail market for infant formula and nearly of the estimated billion us retail market for infant formula  including the retail value of women  infants and children program wic rebates 
wic is a federal grant program administered by the states for the benefit of low income  nutritionally at risk women  infants and children 
our customers include infant formula market leaders mead johnson nutritionals  nestle  abbott nutrition  pfizer formerly wyeth and danone formerly numico  each of whom is selling infant formula supplemented with our nutritional oils 
our customers are now selling infant formula products containing our oils collectively in over countries 
supplemented infant formulas from mead johnson nutritionals  abbott nutrition  pbm products  nestle  hain celestial and nutricia north america are currently being sold in the united states 
in 
table of contents addition  certain infant formula customers are selling products in the united states and abroad that contain our nutritional oils and target the markets for children ages nine months to seven years of age and older 
we are currently marketing and selling life sdha  either directly or through distributors  for food and beverage  supplement and animal feed applications to both us and international companies 
to date  over domestic and international companies have launched non infant formula products that contain life sdha  most of which remain on the market and are believed to be meeting customer expectations 
certain of our dha license and supply agreements with major consumer food products companies establish martek  subject to certain exceptions  as their exclusive supplier of dha for minimum periods of time 
certain of these agreements establish the customer as the exclusive customer of life sdha in a particular food or beverage category or categories or geographic region 
we  along with our customers and certain third parties  are developing other dha delivery methods  including powders and emulsions  to facilitate further entry into the non infant formula markets 
management believes that over the next few years  the non infant formula markets will continue to expand and could ultimately represent a larger opportunity than infant formula 
we have received a favorable review by the fda of our gras notification for the use of dha s in food and beverage applications in the us and have received similar approvals in canada 
we have also received authorization from the ministry of health in china subject to certain conditions and the australia new zealand food authority for the use of dha s oil in all foods and authorization from the european commission and israel for the use of our dha s oil as a novel food ingredient 
this novel food designation authorizes the use of our dha s as an ingredient in certain foods such as certain dairy products  including cheese and yogurt  spreads and dressings  breakfast cereals  food supplements and dietary foods for special medical purposes in the european community and israel 
in addition  in july the standing committee of the european commission and the member states approved the expanded use of our dha s algal oil in beverages  bakery products and nutrition bars 
dha algal oil is also regarded as a traditional food in japan and  as such  is acceptable for use in foods and beverages and dietary supplements 
during the past several years  many new products were launched that contained life sdha 
several of martek s customers such as dean foods  coca cola minute maid  jm smucker crisco  danone  starbuck s  parmalat australia  ragasa and others have launched food and beverage products containing life sdha in the us and other countries 
some of our customers are currently selling products containing life sdha targeted to pregnant and nursing women  including mead johnson nutritionals  wal mart  cvs pharmacy  walgreen s  everett laboratories and mission pharmacal 
generally  these products are also co branded with the life sdha logo 
although we anticipate future growth in annual sales of our nutritional oils  we are likely to continue to experience quarter to quarter and year to year fluctuations in our future operating results  some of which may be significant 
the timing and extent of future oils related revenues are largely dependent upon the following factors the timing of international infant formula market introductions by our customers  the timing of our customers ordering patterns  the timing and extent of stocking and de stocking of inventory by our customers  the timing and extent of our customers production campaigns and plant maintenance shutdowns  the timing and extent of introductions of dha into various child and or adult applications and the marketplace success of such applications  the levels of inclusion of our oils in infant formula  
table of contents the continued acceptance  and extent thereof  of products containing our oils under wic and other regulatory programs in the us  the continued acceptance of these products by consumers and continued demand by our customers  the ability of our customers to incorporate our oils into various foods and beverages  our ability to protect against competitive products through our patents  competition from alternative sources of dha and ara  and agreements with other future third party collaborators to market our products or develop new products 
as such  the likelihood  timing and extent of future profitability are largely dependent on factors such as those mentioned above  as well as others  over which we have limited or no control 
production we manufacture oils rich in dha at our production facilities located in winchester  kentucky  and kingstree  south carolina 
the oils that we produce in these facilities are certified kosher by the orthodox union and are certified halal by the islamic food and nutrition council of america 
both manufacturing facilities have received favorable ratings by the american institute of baking  an independent auditor of food manufacturing facilities  and have obtained the iso environmental management system ems international standard  the most recognized ems standard in the world 
also  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has granted martek s winchester plant  the company s primary shipping location  a health certificate  which is required for import of products into many countries  including china and neighboring countries in the pacific rim 
over of our ara oils are purchased from dsm 
because dsm is a third party manufacturer  we have only limited control over the timing and level of its production volumes 
the balance of our ara requirements is produced at our kingstree facility 
in july  we entered into the first amended and restated ara alliance  purchase  and production agreement the restated agreement with dsm 
the restated agreement  which extends the original supply term through december   amended  consolidated and restated all existing agreements between the two parties governing the cross licensing  purchase  supply and production of ara 
among other things  the restated agreement established ara pricing to martek for calendar years through with the potential for only limited changes related to post volumes and provides that ara pricing subsequent to calendar will be negotiated in the future by the parties 
for the establishment of the through ara pricing and related contractual provisions  we paid dsm approximately million 
while  subject to the limited exceptions noted below  martek is committed to purchasing all of its ara requirements from dsm through the term of the restated agreement  the restated agreement also sets minimum ara purchase quantities for martek in calendar years  and as of october   the value of the remaining calendar year and full calendar years and minimum purchase requirements are approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these minimum purchase quantities approximate the amounts expected to be consumed by us in the normal course of business 
we have attempted to reduce the risk inherent in having a single supplier through certain elements of our supply agreement with dsm 
in connection with this agreement  we have the ability to produce  either directly or through an approved third party  an unlimited amount of ara 
the sale of such self produced ara is limited annually  however  to the greater of i tons of ara oil or ii any amounts ordered by us that dsm is unable to fulfill 
although we currently produce ara ourselves  our existing manufacturing capacity would not permit us to produce ara quantities sufficient to meet current demand without impacting our production of dha 
to further improve our overall ara 
table of contents supply chain  we have directly engaged a us based provider of certain post fermentation ara manufacturing services 
along with our ara downstream processing capabilities at kingstree  this third party facility provides us with multiple us sites for the full downstream processing of ara 
when combining our current dha and ara production capabilities in kingstree and winchester with dsm s current ara production capabilities  we have production capacity for dha and ara products in excess of million in annualized sales  collectively  to the infant formula and non infant formula markets 
as such  our production capabilities exceed current demand  however  we have the ability to manage production levels and  to a certain extent  control our manufacturing costs 
nonetheless  when experiencing excess capacity  we may be unable to produce the required quantities of oil cost effectively due to the existence of significant levels of fixed production costs at our plants and the plants of our suppliers 
the commercial success of our nutritional oils will depend  in part  on our ability to manufacture these oils or have them manufactured at large scale on a routine basis and at a commercially acceptable cost 
our success will also be somewhat dependent on our ability to align our production with customer demand  which is inherently uncertain 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  including the food and drug administration s good manufacturing practice gmp requirements 
under the terms of several of our agreements with infant formula customers  those customers may elect to manufacture these oils themselves 
while our customers are not required to disclose to us that they have begun the process  we are currently unaware of any of our customers producing our oils or preparing to produce our oils  and estimate that it would take a customer a minimum of one year to implement a process for making our oils 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  which are based on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and  as such  actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including fixed assets and certain identifiable intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
as of october   these long lived assets had a total net book value of million 
included in these long lived assets is approximately million of production equipment whose use is not currently required based on present customer demand 
undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess impairment 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based on many assumptions for each target market 
such assumptions include market size  penetration levels and future product margins 
while management believes that its projections are reasonable and that no impairment of these assets exists  different assumptions could affect these evaluations and result in material impairment charges against the carrying value of these assets 
impairment of goodwill we assess the possible impairment of goodwill annually  on august  or more frequently when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
events or circumstances that may require an interim impairment assessment include experiencing disruptions to business  unexpected significant declines in 
table of contents operating results  divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
during fiscal  as in prior years  we operated as one reporting unit and therefore compared the carrying amount of our goodwill to our market value 
market value is determined utilizing our market capitalization plus a control premium 
a control premium is representative of premiums paid in the marketplace to acquire a controlling interest in a company 
if our market value exceeds our carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if our carrying amount exceeds our market value  we would then need to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill via a hypothetical allocation of purchase price 
to the extent that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized for such difference 
as a result of its annual impairment test  management concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of august  subsequent to our annual impairment test  we experienced a decline in our market capitalization to an amount below book value 
as a result  we reconsidered our analysis and we noted that applying a control premium at october  similar to the one applied for our annual impairment test resulted in a market value in excess of carrying value 
therefore  we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the goodwill was impaired and we did not perform an interim impairment test as of october  we will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and other industry events 
any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of our reporting unit  it is possible a material change could occur 
that is  if our market capitalization declines  our goodwill could become impaired and a charge to our results of operations may be required 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from three sources product sales  contract manufacturing and collaborations 
we recognize product sales revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  the product is shipped and title and risk of loss are transferred 
a number of our infant formula license contracts include an upfront license fee  a prepayment of product sales and established pricing on future product sales  which also may include discounts based on the achievement of certain volume purchases 
the consideration from these contracts is allocated based on the relative fair values of the separate elements 
revenue is recognized on product sales when goods are shipped and all other conditions for revenue recognition are met 
if volume pricing discounts are deemed to be a separate element  revenue on related product shipments is recognized using the estimated average price to the customer over the term of the discount period  which requires an estimation of total production shipments over that time frame 
amounts billed in excess of the estimated average price are recorded as deferred revenue 
conversely  a receivable is recorded for the excess of the estimated average price over amounts billed 
estimates of average prices are reviewed and  if necessary  adjusted periodically based on updated estimates of product shipments during each contract year 
our historical estimates of product shipments have approximated actual results 
amounts recorded as either deferred revenue or a receivable are settled at the end of each contract year  which generally is december cash received as a prepayment on future product purchases is deferred and recognized as revenue when product is shipped 
revenue from product licenses is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
our terms of sale allow for limited rights of return with such rights based solely on compliance with agreed upon customer product specifications 
we test the product for compliance with customer product specifications prior to shipment 
such returns have not been material 
royalty income is recorded when earned  based on information provided by our customers 

table of contents contract manufacturing revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers and all other conditions for revenue recognition are met 
cash received that is related to future performance under such contracts is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned 
revenue earned from collaboration work may come from stand alone arrangements for certain discrete development work or multiple deliverable arrangements that include such development work followed by larger scale manufacturing efforts 
revenue is recognized based on the nature of the arrangements  with each of the multiple deliverables in a given arrangement having distinct and separate fair values 
fair values are determined via consistent pricing between stand alone arrangements and multiple deliverable arrangements  as well as a competitive bidding process 
collaborations may be performed on a time and materials basis or fixed fee basis 
for time and materials arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are performed and billed 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer 
deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions we provide for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we also recognize deferred tax assets for tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when such amounts are projected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
as of october   our total gross deferred tax asset was million  which will require future taxable income of approximately million for realization 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets including valuation allowances and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws and the changes in such laws 
we have also considered our future operating results  which require assumptions such as future market penetration levels  forecasted revenues and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a change to our valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million as of october  relates to certain state net operating loss and credit carryforwards whose realizability is uncertain 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in material amounts of additional tax expense or benefit in the period of change 
effective november   we began recognizing the benefits of tax positions in the financial statements if such positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority and satisfy the appropriate measurement criteria 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is generally measured and recognized as the tax benefit having the highest likelihood  in our judgment  of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
at october   we had unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately million 
the determination of these unrecognized amounts requires significant judgments and interpretation of complex tax laws 
different judgments or interpretations could result in material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits 
inventory we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market and include appropriate elements of material  labor and indirect costs 
inventories on hand total million as of october and are valued using a weighted average approach that approximates the first in  first out method 
in addition  the restated agreement with dsm also sets minimum ara purchase quantities for martek in calendar years  and as of october   the value of the remaining calendar year and full calendar years and minimum purchase requirements are approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we regularly review inventory quantities 
table of contents on hand and our future inventory purchase commitments and record a reserve for excess  obsolete and off spec inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand and the likelihood of consumption in the normal course of manufacturing operations 
those reserves are based on significant estimates 
our estimates of future product demand or assessments of future consumption may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts and assessments  any significant unanticipated changes  particularly in demand or competition levels  could have a significant impact on the values of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in addition  abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to  among other things  idle facilities  freight handling and waste material expenses are recognized as period charges and expensed as incurred 
the determination of such period costs requires the use of judgment in establishing the level of production that the company considers normal 
a different conclusion as to what constitutes normal production levels could result in material changes to idle capacity expenses recognized 
patent cost capitalization we incur certain external legal and related costs in connection with patent applications 
if a future economic benefit is anticipated from the resulting patent or an alternate future use is available to the company  such costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the patent 
we also capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents when it is believed that the future economic benefit of the patent will be maintained or increased and a successful defense is probable 
capitalized patent defense costs are amortized over the remaining life of the related patent 
our assessment of future economic benefit and or a successful defense of our patents involves considerable management judgment 
a different conclusion could result in material write offs of the carrying value of these assets 
fair value measurements as of november   the company adopted the provisions of guidance codified as financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc for financial instruments 
asc defines fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the asc hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs  or assumptions  used in the determination of fair value and requires assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed as either a level  or fair value instrument 
different from levels and  level instruments are valued using unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
at october   we had level assets of million  which include both auction rate securities and an auction rate securities rights agreement the put agreement 
of this amount  fair value changes in assets totaling million have been recorded through earnings and changes in the remainder have been recorded through other comprehensive income 
some of the unobservable inputs into the discounted cash flow models on which we base our level valuations include  but are not limited to  periodic coupon rates  market required rates of return and the expected term of each security 
changes to the inputs used as of october  would cause fluctuations to the fair value of the affected instruments and such fair value changes could be material 

table of contents results of operations revenues the following table presents revenues by category in thousands year ended october  product sales contract manufacturing and services total revenues product sales decreased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal product sales were comprised of the following in thousands year ended october  infant formula market food and beverage market pregnancy and nursing  nutritional supplements and animal feeds non nutritional products total product sales sales to the infant formula market decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to de stocking of inventory by certain of our major infant formula customers and the impact of declining us births 
these declines offset the growth experienced during fiscal in our international infant formula markets 
sales to the infant formula market increased in fiscal over due to the growth in demand in both the us and international infant formula markets during that period 
launches of new products and the growth of existing products containing life sdha resulted in slightly higher sales to the food and beverage market in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition  sales into the pregnancy and nursing  nutritional supplements and animal feeds markets increased significantly in fiscal due to an overall expansion of martek s customer base in these markets  particularly pregnancy and nursing 
customer base expansion was also experienced in fiscal in the food and beverage  pregnancy and nursing and nutritional supplements markets which led to sales growth in these areas from fiscal to fiscal approximately  and of our product sales in fiscal  and  respectively  were generated by sales to mead johnson nutritionals  abbott nutrition  nestle  pfizer formerly wyeth and danone formerly numico 
although we are not given precise information by our customers as to the countries in which infant formula containing our oils is ultimately sold  we estimate that approximately  and of our sales to infant formula customers for fiscal  and  respectively  relate to sales in the us as of october   we estimate that formula supplemented with our oils had penetrated almost all of the us infant formula market 
although we anticipate that annual product sales will continue to grow  our future sales growth is subject to quarter to quarter fluctuations and is dependent to a significant degree upon the following factors i the expansions of current products containing our nutritional oils by our customers in new and existing markets  ii the launches of new products containing our nutritional oils by current or future customers and the success in the marketplace of such launches  iii the timing and extent of stocking and de stocking of inventory by our customers  iv the levels of inclusion of our oils in infant formula  v the timing and extent of our customers production campaigns and plant maintenance shutdowns  and vi the availability and use by our customers and others of competitive products 

table of contents contract manufacturing and services revenues  totaling approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  relate mainly to fermentation work performed for various third parties at our kingstree  south carolina facility 
the slight increase in fiscal over fiscal was due to the commencement of revenues associated with martek s joint development agreement with bp for work on microbial oils for use as biofuels 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to additional orders from one existing contract manufacturing customer 
during fiscal  while revenues remained at approximately the same level as fiscal  we reduced the scope of our contract manufacturing activities  and we anticipate further limiting our contract manufacturing activities over the course of fiscal in order to focus resources on our higher margin nutritional oils business 
other than the reductions to revenue and associated gross margin  we do not expect that the cessation of contract manufacturing activities will have any material impact on our results of operations 
our collaborative work with bp is expected to continue through at least as a result of the above  total revenues decreased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenues the following table presents our cost of revenues in thousands year ended october  cost of product sales cost of contract manufacturing and services total cost of revenues cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales has improved in each of the last two years with decreases to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decreases were due mainly to dha productivity improvements improvement in both comparative periods and decreases in our overall cost of ara in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal 
cost of contract manufacturing and services was million  million and million in fiscal  and our contract manufacturing and services margins vary between periods primarily due to contract mix and volume

table of contents research and development our research and development costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to continued focus on clinical research and product development 
our research and development costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to additional resources dedicated to  among other things  the development of new food and beverage applications for life sdha 
our research and development efforts continue to focus on i broadening the scientific evidence supporting our products  ii improving manufacturing processes  iii developing food and beverage applications  and iv developing new products and technologies to expand our market offerings 
we expect to continue to experience quarter to quarter fluctuations in research and development expenses primarily due to the timing of outside services  including third party clinical trial services 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative costs decreased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease is due  in part  to close management of spending levels  which led to reductions in areas such as personnel  travel and marketing costs 
the fiscal decrease also resulted from reductions in annual incentive compensation payouts due to the attainment of only a limited number of the pre established operational and financial goals for the year 
our selling  general and administrative costs increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from higher personnel costs driven by continued investment in personnel needed to support our growth as well as an increase over fiscal associated with the variable component of company wide compensation resulting from our improved overall financial performance 
amortization of intangible assets we capitalize patent application and patent defense costs in addition to certain other external costs related to our intellectual property portfolio to the extent that we anticipate a future economic benefit or an alternate future use is available to us from such expenditures 
we amortize these costs over the expected life of the respective assets 
we recorded amortization expense related to our intangible assets of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from the expiration of certain patents and licenses in fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from the amortization associated with a new license arrangement entered into during fiscal see item legal proceedings of part i of this form k for further discussion of certain patent matters 
other operating expenses we incurred other operating expenses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these costs in fiscal  and primarily include production trials and start up costs incurred in the expanded utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to lower interest earned on cash balances 
interest and other income  net  increased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  due primarily to varying levels of cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and variable interest rates earned 

table of contents interest expense interest expense decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal is due to reduced levels of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and the repayment in full during of our former term debt prior to its scheduled maturity 
since october   there have been no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  which results in an effective tax rate of approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million of previously unrecognized research and development tax credits  which served to decrease our effective tax rate in that year by 
during fiscal  it was determined that certain net operating loss carryforwards  whose related deferred tax asset had previously been fully reserved  were more likely than not to be realized 
this determination was made based upon the company s projection of future taxable income which  it was concluded  had less uncertainty due to longer histories and certain recently executed contractual arrangements with its customer base 
this valuation allowance reversal resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately million related to net operating loss carryforwards generated from operations and a decrease to goodwill of approximately million related to net operating loss carryforwards acquired from omegatech in realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
as of october   the total gross value of our deferred tax asset was million  which will require future taxable income of approximately million for realization 
our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million as of october  relates to certain state net operating loss and credit carryforwards whose realizability is uncertain 
should realization of these deferred tax assets become more likely than not  the resulting valuation allowance reversal would be reflected as additional benefit in the period of change 
as of october   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire at various dates between and the timing and manner in which us net operating loss carryforwards may be utilized may be limited if we incur a change in ownership as defined under section of the internal revenue code 
although we have net operating losses available to offset future taxable income  we may be subject to federal alternative minimum taxes 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income was million in fiscal as compared to net income of million in fiscal and net income of million in fiscal

liquidity and capital resources since fiscal  we have financed our operations primarily from the following sources cash generated from operations  cash received from the exercise of stock options  and debt financing 

table of contents our cash flows for the years ended october   and were as follows in thousands year ended october  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities total cash inflows at october   our primary sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents totaling million as well as the million available under our revolving credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents increased million since october   largely due to our net income during that period which contributed to the generation of million of cash from operating activities 
these operating cash flows reflect a reduction of million from fiscal which was caused primarily by decreases in our current liabilities versus the prior year as well as the inventory increases caused by the timing and extent of martek s fiscal ara purchases from dsm 
consistent with prior years  the timing of martek s purchases of ara are largely dependent upon dsm s scheduled production runs 
operating cash flows increased from fiscal to fiscal by million primarily due to earnings levels between periods as well as inventory and current liability fluctuations 
our fiscal investing cash flows reflect certain cash outflows associated with the restated agreement with dsm as payments totaling approximately million were made in fiscal related to the establishment of ara pricing from through and related contractual provisions see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii
