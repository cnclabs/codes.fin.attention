the md a detailed below  is presented in five parts  critical accounting estimates  results of operations for versus and versus  recent accounting developments  liquidity and capital resources  business and financial outlook and risks and uncertainties 
this md a should be read in conjunction with the december  consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require judgment on the part of management and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances 
management continually evaluates the information that forms the basis of its estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates which management believes to be most important to our business 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product or service and when all of the following have occurred a sales agreement is in place  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in the sunopta bioprocess segment  the percentage of completion method is used to account for significant contracts 
consideration given to customers such as value incentives  rebates  early payment discounts and other discounts are recorded as reductions to revenues at the time of sale 
the amounts of revenue and profit recognized each year are based on the ratio of hours incurred to the total expected hours 
costs incurred on long term contracts include labor  material  other direct costs and overheads 
losses  if any  on long term contracts are recognized during the period they are determined 
total expected hours on a project are based on management s estimates during the progression of a project  including meeting specific criteria under the contract  testing during certain phases  and ensuring overall functionality 
we update the total expected hours to be incurred as new information becomes known 
significant differences between actual and the estimated hours to complete a project could result in changes in the amount of revenues recorded and their related costs being realized  which could also impact gross margins in a particular period 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from its customers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to us 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
sunopta inc december  k inventory inventory is our largest current asset 
our inventory consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  valued on a weighted average cost basis  or estimated net realizable value except certain grain inventories that are carried at market value 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimated value of inventory when provisions to record inventory at market are necessary 
in order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date  management evaluates a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory 
the factors include the age of inventory  the amount of inventory held by type  future demand for products and the expected future selling price management expects to realize by selling the inventory 
these estimates made by management are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time  using available information  expected business plans and expected market conditions 
we perform a review of its inventory by reporting unit and product line on a quarterly basis 
in fiscal  we recorded a significant inventory provision to adjust the carrying value of inventory in fruit specialties to market as a result of increased raw material  processing and input prices that resulted in anticipated selling prices being lower than the cost of our inventories 
the total provision required in amounted to  based on management s action plan to reduce its inventory levels in this group 
refer to results of operations in the management discussion and analysis for further information on inventory valuation issues that occurred in note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in inventory reserve 
prepaid and other current assets prepaid and other current assets include amounts paid in cash and recorded as a current asset prior to consumption 
the balance also includes advances to growers required to secure future delivery of product net of provisions 
an allowance against realizing these advances is recorded when it is determined that we will not recover the advances  due to default on scheduled repayment terms  or general economic or market conditions 
advances to growers are typically made at the start of the growing season 
we monitor our advances to growers by monitoring adherence to agreed upon terms as well as evaluating general economic and market conditions  and assessing the status of the crops being grown in order to determine if the collection of the advance is at risk 
management judgment is required to assess whether allowances against growers advances are necessary including assessing the relationships with the growers and expected crop 
at the end of the growing season  management re evaluates any existing advances and provides fully for any advances relating to the previous season 
due to assumptions relating to the quality of the grower and expected crop additional provisions may be necessary compared to initial estimates 
impairment testing of goodwill with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
in  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are no longer amortized  but instead are tested at least annually for impairment 
any impairment loss is recognized in income 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available 
to evaluate goodwill  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists 
sunopta inc december  k we measure the fair value of reporting units using discounted cash flows 
because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted future cash flow includes a terminal value 
the first year or base year in the calculation of the discounted cash flow model is based on actual results in each component  adjusted for unusual and non recurring items 
future years cash flows to perpetuity are forecasted based on projected revenue growth  and management s planned business strategies in future periods that would impact actual cash flows reported in the base year 
examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility  a reduction of working capital at a specific location  and price increases or cost reductions within business units 
the revenue growth and planned business strategies for future periods incorporated into the discounted cash flow model reflect our long term view of the market 
the discount rate is based on the group s targeted weighted average cost of capital  which is not necessarily the same as our weighted average cost of capital 
these assumptions are subject to change and are also impacted by our ability to achieve its forecasts and by economic conditions which may impact future results and result in projections not being attained 
each year we re evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
for the year ended december   we determined that the carrying value of goodwill in the fruit group and part of international sourcing and trading group exceeded its fair value and  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of  to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
for the year ended december   we determined that the carrying value of goodwill in the fruit group exceeded its fair value and  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of  note of the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the critical assumptions used in the annual impairment test 
purchase price allocation business acquisitions are accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
under this method  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired generally requires the most judgment  and include estimates of future profitability  and or customer and supplier based attrition  income tax rates and discount rates 
changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities could impact the amounts assigned to assets  liabilities and goodwill in the purchase price allocation 
future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an asset or goodwill impairment 
further  amortization periods are subjective based on expected useful lives and chosen rates 
note of the consolidated financial statements provide information with respect to businesses acquired in fiscal and  and note outlines annual amortization expense relating to these intangibles 
accrued expenses and other assets we make estimates of future payments and receipts which relate to current and future accounting periods 
these estimates cover items such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses  estimates of taxes and estimates of amounts payable or receivable under legal suits 
in establishing appropriate accruals and receivable balances  management must make judgments regarding the amount of the disbursement or receipts that will ultimately be incurred or received 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid or received could differ for management s estimates 
sunopta inc december  k income taxes we are liable for income taxes in the united states  canada  and other jurisdictions where we operate 
in making an estimate of its income tax liability  we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet 
we also estimate the amount of valuations allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable 
this judgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may differ from forecasts 
management assesses the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied to  the number of years based on management s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances 
if different judgments had been used  our income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
in addition  the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with our assessment 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of our deferred tax assets 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from accrued position 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal  provincial  state and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
stock compensation we maintain several stock option plans under which incentive stock options may be granted to employees and non employee directors 
prior to  we had adopted the fair value measurement provisions of sfas no 
which required the note disclosure of our earnings as if stock compensation was recorded 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  stock based compensation  using the modified perspective transition method which requires that we record stock based compensation expenses within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
at each grant date  management is required to estimate a number of inputs  such as the estimated life of the option and the forfeiture rate used in the black scholes model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non employee directors 
once determined at the grant date  fair value of the stock award is recorded over the vesting period of the options granted

without the movements in foreign exchange  internal growth was 
revenue growth continues to be led by the sunopta food group as revenues increased  mainly due to the acquisition of the organic corporation toc  which contributed incremental revenues of  and strong internal growth from the sunopta grains and foods and distribution groups 
gross margins increased  or  in to  from  as a percentage of revenues  consolidated gross margins decreased 
higher raw material and freight costs beyond what could be passed along to customers  plant inefficiencies from expansion projects and inventory management initiatives  pre opening costs for our modesto facility and the acquisition of toc  which operates at lower margins  have all unfavourably impacted the food group s margin rate 
this was slightly offset by the favourable turnaround in the fruit group s fruit specialties division 
also contributing to the lower gross margin rate are the inventory reserves to mark to market the raw magnesium inventory  and a decline in steel and foundry market which impacted opta minerals in the fourth quarter 
sunopta inc december  k warehouse and distribution w d costs for the year ended december  were  an increase of  compared to the same period in these costs are solely related to the distribution group as warehousing and distribution costs for other groups are considered part of cost of goods sold 
w d costs as a percentage of distribution group revenues decreased to in due to leveraging existing warehouse infrastructure while increasing volume 
for further details see the distribution group analysis included within 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a including intangible asset amortization increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in of this increase   is related to one time professional fees incurred as a result of the financial restatement and investigation process 
the acquisitions of toc  newco as  mcp  the mexican berry operations and neo nutritionals increased sg a by  higher compensation costs associated with increased headcount to support expanded business operations combined with increased variable costs due to the increase in revenue are the main drivers behind the remaining sg a increase of  sg a as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the rate difference is primarily due to the impact of a weaker canadian dollar on canadian denominated costs  in addition to the acquisition of toc which operated with an sg a rate of of revenues 
foreign exchange gains increased to  in compared to a gain of  the increase is mainly due to favourable movements from the canadian dollar and the euro to the u 
s dollar in the second and third quarter of we entered into a number of canadian dollar and euro forward contracts that  due to the volatility of exchange rates in these currencies  were closed prior to reaching their maturity 
gains of this magnitude cannot be expected to recur 
operating income increased by  or  over the twelve months ended december  due to the factors noted above 
further details on revenue  gross margins corporate cost allocations and operating income are provided below by operating group 
other expenses decreased  to  in other expenses in mainly relate to the legal judgment in favour of one of sbi s customers offset by gains from certain insurance proceeds 
in  other expenses mainly related to legal fees and restructuring costs related to the consolidation of warehouses within the distribution group 
based on our annual test for impairment  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill in the fruit group and international sourcing and trading group  excluding toc  exceeded its fair value  and  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of  compared to the twelve months ended december   interest expense increased by  due to increased long term debt and operating lines net of cash on hand 
the increase in debt is primarily related to acquisitions completed over the past twelve months and higher working capital levels throughout the year due to internal growth 
in addition  we experienced increased premiums over libor due to certain financial ratios increasing 
the income tax expense in was  compared to a recovery of  in the expense in the current year  in comparison to a recovery in reflects of higher earnings before income tax and an allowance related to income tax valuation 
minority interest in was  compared to  in  mainly reflecting the minority interest component of opta minerals as the company owned approximately at the end of net losses for the year were  as compared to net income of  a difference of  due in most part to the reasons described in the preceding paragraphs 
basic and diluted loss per share were in compared to earnings per share of for sunopta inc december  k update on previously issued guidance adjusted net earnings for were per diluted common share  which is below previously provided guidance of to per diluted common share 
other than the professional fees  severance and related costs incurred in relation to the internal investigation  our previous guidance did not anticipate the non cash goodwill impairment charges  a non cash income tax valuation allowance  and the previously announced arbitration decision in the sunopta bioprocess group 
accordingly we feel it is appropriate to add back these specific items to arrive at adjusted net earnings 
the shortfall from previously issued guidance of to per diluted common share is primarily due to significant declines in the fourth quarter in certain commodity prices that resulted in the need to record write downs of inventory to its net realizable value  especially in opta minerals inc loss per diluted share adjusted for professional fees  severance and related costs incurred in relation to the internal investigation non cash goodwill impairment charges non cash income tax valuation allowance arbitration decision in sunopta bioprocess group adjusted net earnings per diluted common share adjusted net earnings per diluted common share is not a gaap measure 
we believe adjusted net earnings adjusted for the impact of the professional fees  severance and related costs incurred in relation to the internal investigation  goodwill impairment charges  income tax valuation allowance and the arbitration decision in the sunopta bioprocess group provides useful information to understand the underlying performance of the business and as a result these items have been adjusted

in base currencies  internal growth was 
acquisition revenues resulted primarily from the acquisition of toc within the sunopta international sourcing and trading group where the group contributed incremental revenues of  continued strength in soybean  corn  sunflower and soymilk revenues in the sunopta grains and foods group contributed  of higher food group sales 
these increases were also impacted by generally higher commodity prices 
revenue growth of  within the sunopta distribution group was due to improved sales in grocery and natural health products 
favourable sales of  from the sunopta fruit group was mainly due to the acquisition of the mexican berry operations in in addition to higher volumes of healthy fruit snacks from the new bar forming equipment 
this was offset by  in lower revenues in the sunopta ingredients group due to the weakness in the dairy blending operations and lower contract manufacturing volumes 
gross profit in the food group increased  in to  or of revenues  compared to  or of revenues  in the continued turnaround in the sunopta fruit group contributed  in incremental margins 
higher volumes within the grains and foods and distribution groups improved margins by  improved margins of  was due to the acquisition of toc within the sunopta international sourcing and trading operations 
this was offset by lower margins from the ingredients group of  due to unfavourable volumes and plant efficiencies related to the midwest flooding in the gross profit rate decreased in to of revenues 
excluding toc  which has a lower inherent margin rate  the food group s margin rate was  which is comparable to higher commodity prices  plant inefficiencies and pre opening costs associated with plant expansions in our grains and foods group negatively impacted the overall food group margin percentage 
also unfavourably impacting the food group margin were higher sourcing  freight and storage costs as customer pricing often lagged cost increases and was further compounded by the depreciation in the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
plant throughput suffered as we strategically reduced production to reduce inventory levels 
higher inventory reserves and mark to market adjustments  especially in the fourth quarter  also contributed to the year over year reduction in gross margin rates 
these declines were partially offset by the continued turnaround in the sunopta fruit group  which recorded a gross margin rate of in compared to a margin loss of in segment operating income in the sunopta food group increased by to  in from  in the continued turnaround in the fruit specialties division of the sunopta fruit group improved income by  strong volumes of grains and grains based ingredients in the sunopta grains and foods group increased food group income by  the sunopta international sourcing and trading operations acquisition of toc and the continued strength in the sunopta distribution group due to improved grocery and natural health products improved operating income by a combined  offsetting these improvements are reduced operating income of  in the ingredients group due to higher supply costs beyond what was passed through in increased customer pricing  in addition to plant inefficiencies related to the flooding in the midwestern united states 
the food group s results include the impact of higher corporate cost allocations of  a more comprehensive discussion on group results and corporate cost allocations is included below with the various groups that make up the sunopta food group 
effective january   two divisions previously reported within the sunopta ingredients group were transferred  one to the sunopta grains and foods group and the other to the sunopta distribution group

segment operating income is calculated as segment operating income divided by segment revenues 
sunopta inc december  k toc and organic ingredients were removed from the sunopta fruit group and combined to create a new group called sunopta international sourcing and trading group because this reflects how our chief decision makers review and assess these reporting units 
looking forward  we expect significant improvement in results within the food group led by a continued turnaround in the fruit specialties division of the fruit group 
the fruit specialties division can expect lower storage costs as average inventory balances will be lower in  operating cost reductions as two facilities have been temporarily closed and headcount has been reduced at many locations  including the closure of a regional sales office 
the food group has also realized significant new business  in the grains and foods group for private label aseptic soy milk and in international sourcing and trading business for private label organic orange juice 
both are expected to add to profitability 
the food group is also expected to benefit from customer pricing taken from late in the third quarter up to february of across almost all segments within the food group coupled with reduced costs  especially freight and natural gas 
headcount reduction measures have also occurred in other groups in the food group 
the food group expects product mix movements within its portfolio as consumers and other food manufacturers continue to adapt to the economic downturn 
the food group expects to manage its production and inventory levels carefully to reduce the likelihood of inventory write downs and is carefully monitoring its credit terms to avoid an increase in bad debts 
target operating margins for the food group are

the sunopta grains and foods group contributed  in revenues in compared to  in  a increase 
this increase was attributed entirely to internal growth and a significant rise in commodity prices on soy  corn and sunflower products 
the group realized significant increases in revenues related to higher demand and prices for non gmo and organic grains and grains based food ingredients  including organic oils  sweeteners and dairy products totalling  the group also realized increases of  in aseptic and extended shelf life esl soy and alternate beverage sales due to growth in volumes from existing contracts and the addition of a large contract late in the year with a major food service restaurant operator 
revenue within the sunflower based businesses were  higher than last year due to increased demand for in shell and bakery kernel sunflower products 
the roasted products snack food business had a decrease in revenue of  versus the prior year due to the loss of a significant customer contract 
gross margin in the sunopta grains and foods group increased by  in compared to  however  the gross margin percentage decreased to over the same period 
higher sales volumes  commodity prices and plant efficiencies improved margins by  sunflower margins increased by  due to improved volumes and pricing on bird food products  oil  conoil and chips 
these improvements were offset by lower margins on soymilk and roasted grain products of  due to increased raw material costs and plant inefficiencies related to existing plant expansions 
additionally  the grains and foods group incurred one time pre opening expenses of  relating to its west coast production facility  which is anticipated to become operational during the second fiscal quarter of the overall decline in gross margin rate of in was mainly related to the impacts of higher commodity prices  in addition to the plant inefficiencies from our plant expansions  pre opening expenses and higher inventory reserves 
sunopta inc december  k segment operating income increased by  or  as a result of higher volumes in core businesses  the gross margin items noted above and an increase in foreign exchange gains of  related to forward contracts within the sunflower business for sales realized in euros 
in addition to favourable margins  sg a decreased  this was offset by higher corporate cost allocations of  looking forward  we expect a solid year of performance in with increased revenues and segment income from the sunopta grains and foods group 
we will be expanding our capacity to manufacture aseptic and esl soy and alternate beverages including the addition of the west coast facility and intend on focusing on growing our ip soy bean business  increasing revenues from organic feed and increasing our participation in the specialty oils markets 
our long term expectation for this group is to maintain a segment operating margin of to which assumes we are able to secure consistent quantity and quality grains and sunflower stocks  improve product mix  and control costs

the sunopta ingredients group contributed revenues of  in compared to  in  a decrease 
the decrease is attributable to decreased dairy blending volumes and prices due to inherent declines in the price of raw materials of  lower volumes in contract manufacturing of  and decreased technical processing of starch and other ingredients products of  these were partially offset by increased revenues of oat and soy fiber of  gross margins in the sunopta ingredients group decreased by  and the margin rate decreased from to of revenue 
weaker demand and lower prices for dairy blend products have significantly impacted the group s margin rate 
the ingredients group s margin rate was unfavourably impacted by increases in raw material  energy and transportation costs related to oat and soy fiber products which preceded pricing taken during the year 
inefficiencies resulting from plant shutdowns and subsequent start up following the series of floods that affected the midwestern united states during also led to margin declines

the acquisition of the mexican berry operations in may contributed  in incremental revenues in revenue in the brokerage operations increased by  due mainly to a change in business circumstances during the third quarter of that led to reporting certain revenue on a gross basis  rather than on a net margin basis 
offsetting these increases were reduced sales in the california berry operations and fruit toppings division of  mainly due to lower industrial and private label volumes of organic fruit and fruit purees as the business was repositioned for future profitability partially offset by increased sales due to expanded fruit topping product offerings 
gross margins in the fruit group increased by  in to  or of revenue  compared to a margin loss of of revenue in in  the california berry operations sold through inventory that had an associated reserve of  to reduce its value to the expected net realizable amount 
comparatively  during  a provision to reduce the carrying value of inventory that was being carried at a cost higher than net realizable value resulted in a charge of  as a result of the delay in filing our form k for the year ended december   provisions established to reduce certain inventory to its net realizable value were prepared using the most current pricing knowledge available 
gross margins in were further impacted by period costs that are expensed as incurred 
the reserves established at december  were not intended to cover period costs such as third party storage costs and utility costs which were  higher in compared to to reduce these storage and other handling costs on inventories  during we undertook extensive efforts to sell through the stock of inventory that existed at december  these efforts  combined with improved production planning  resulted in favourable absorption efficiencies of  versus additionally  improved customer pricing in the california berry operations  offset slightly by a decline in volume  improved margins by  compared to sunopta inc december  k gross margin improved  in healthy fruit snacks  brokerage and fruit toppings primarily due to increased volumes partially due to expanded product offerings 
the acquisition of the mexican berry operations incrementally added  to gross margin in compared to the overall improvement in margin rate in reflects close to breakeven margins in the california berry operations as the division spent most of the year selling through a large portion of inventory that was already written down to net realizable value 
segment operating income in the sunopta fruit group increased by  to a loss of  in compared to a loss of  in the same period of in addition to the increase in gross margin of  noted above  bad debt expense decreased by  offsetting these favourable variances was an increase in compensation and other costs of  due to increased headcount to support expanded business development and improved controls  new industrial product programs  severance and various other initiatives to improve internal processes 
the corporate cost allocation increased by  and the acquisition of the mexican berry operation incrementally added  in sg a related expenses 
the remaining increase in operating income versus the same period in is due to increased foreign exchange gains of  which are derived from mexican and canadian operations within the fruit group 
was a year of transition for both fruit specialties and healthy fruit snacks 
looking forward  we anticipate improved margins and a return to profitability in as a result of increased customer pricing  a more favourable sales mix and improved plant efficiencies 
the california berry operations has made substantial headway into working through the inventory that was written down to net realizable value in margins realized on this inventory which was mainly related to bulk industrial and bi products  were minimal and contributed to the operating losses experienced during as they were not sufficient to cover period costs such as storage 
as fruit specialties transitions to a more favourable sales and production mix and healthy fruit snacks continues to expand volumes and efficiency in its bar forming lines  we expect operating results to improve 
long term we expect operating margins from the sunopta fruit group

the fruit topping operation improved revenue by  due to expanded fruit toppings and organic fruit bases sales 
gross margins in the fruit group decreased by  in to a loss of  or of revenue  compared to profit of  or of revenue in the substantial decrease is due to higher inventory and processing costs resulting in lower margins within the california berry operations  and is described in further detail below 
the acquisitions of the mexican operations and hess provided additional margins of  offset by a decline in gross margin within healthy fruit snacks of  this decline was due to plant inefficiencies and other start up related operational issues associated with the commissioning of new bar forming equipment 
specifically  included in cost of goods sold is  related to commissioning costs incurred during trial production on the new equipment line in costs to commission the new equipment line were incurred prior to the equipment attaining commercial viability 
these installations also impaired the ability to price certain customers until production capacity could consistently respond to customer demand 
gross margin contributions from fruit toppings decreased  compared to gross margins declined by  within the california berry operations 
the decline was as a result of an aggressive purchasing strategy which occurred during a time of increasing raw material and input prices 
selling prices were not updated in a timely manner to adequately pass these increased commodity costs on to our customers  which ultimately had a negative impact on gross profit 
margins were further eroded by higher storage costs  increased temporary labor costs and higher overheads  much of which was a direct function of the rise in purchasing volume 
additional operational inefficiencies associated with capital expansion and turnover of key personnel also contributed to the decline in margin 
the increase in carrying value and volume of inventory on hand in relation to a market with abundant supply ultimately resulted in provisions being required to reduce the investment in inventory to net realizable value 
these provisions were concentrated mainly in bulk industrial and bi product inventory

offsetting the sg a cost increases and higher management fee allocations were increased foreign exchange gains of  liquidity and capital resources we obtain our short term financing through a combination of cash generated from operating activities  cash and cash equivalents  and available operating lines of credit 
at december   we have availability under certain lines of credit of approximately  
revolving acquisition lines are also available to sunopta and to opta minerals with availability at december  of up to   and   respectively 
as part of our credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders  we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
as a result of the inventory adjustments in the sunopta fruit group for the year ended december   we were not in compliance with these covenants at december  and march  we received a waiver to these covenants at december  and march  which allowed us to be in compliance  and notification that previously filed covenants for the first  second and third quarters of did not need to be recalculated 
in addition to the waivers above  we amended our credit facilities to adjust certain financial covenant ratio calculations and ratio targets providing revised financial covenants for june  september and december and march compliance with these covenants is dependent on our achieving forecasts because the covenants are calculated based on trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of our companies that are financed with the lending syndicate  compared to the total debt of those companies 
we were in compliance for the periods ended june  september  and december  we currently believe that further waivers will not be required and that these covenants will be met based on achieving forecasts 
failure to meet these or other covenants could result in the acceleration of the debt amounting to  and allow lenders to exercise their security rights and would require the debt to be classified as current  unless additional waivers are granted which are at the discretion of the lender

we are currently in compliance with these covenants after receiving the above noted amendments and waivers 
our operating lines of credit also are up for renewal on june  there is no certainty that these lines of credit will be renewed at the same amounts or the same rates given the current banking environment 
we have the following sources from which we can fund our operating cash requirements o cash and cash equivalents refer to note of the consolidated financial statements

o cash flows generated from operating activities 
o cash flows generated from exercise of options which may be in the money during the year 
o additional long term financing

cash flows compared to net cash and cash equivalents decreased  during increased by  to  as at december  
overall  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of repayments of line of credit facilities  long term debt and current year purchases of property  plant and equipment  offset by cash provided by a reduction in working capital levels from the prior year 
operating activities generated cash of  in  an improvement of  as compared to a use of cash of  in the majority of the improvement in cash provided by operating activities was due to a  reduction in cash used to fund working capital 
of the total decrease in cash used to fund working capital   was the result of a reduction in inventories  consistent with our objective of reducing inventory levels across all operating segments 
specifically  we lowered production volumes and undertook efforts to sell through a large portion of inventory that existed at december  within the fruit specialties division 
additionally  a decrease in accounts receivable  year over year generated  of cash flows  as days sales outstanding dso decreased from days at december  to days at december   due to increased collection efforts 
in addition to the increase in cash flow due to working capital reductions was a  increase to items not affecting cash  due mainly to higher goodwill impairment charges of  an increase in the non cash impact that amortization and changes to deferred tax balances  offset by a decrease in earnings of  investing activities used  of cash in  compared to a use of  in this  improvement in cash flows was due in part to a decrease in cash used to acquire companies of  we completed two acquisitions in  versus four in purchases of property  plant and equipment decreased by  in compared to as a result of a curtailment of capital spending to baseline maintenance levels  as well as the completion of the bar forming capital project in our healthy fruit snacks operation in early in addition  purchase of patents  trademarks and other intangible assets decreased by  as  incurred to acquire a tradename in was not incurred in the company generated cash of  the majority of which related to insurance proceeds of  in the grains and foods group related to fires that occurred in late and early financing activities used cash of  in  compared to  of cash provided in in  we generated cash of  net of costs as a result of an equity offering in february  and  in cash was raised in june as a result of the preference shares issued by sunopta bioprocess 
no such private or public offerings took place during additionally  in  we borrowed  on our line of credit facilities to fund working capital increases mainly in the fruit specialties division and the grains and foods groups

sunopta inc december  k operating activities used cash of  in  compared to being a source of cash of  in a decrease in earnings of  was a contributing factor to the use of cash in compared to  as well as an increase in cash used in working capital 
with respect to working capital  the largest use of cash in compared to was for inventory 
the california berry operations pursued an aggressive purchasing strategy during to increase inventory levels as part of a growth strategy 
however  there was an abundant supply of inventory in the market in the last half of which resulted in an increased amount of inventory on hand at december  in addition to the inventory at california berry operations  the sunopta grains and foods group held approximately  of inventory at december  compared to approximately  at december  the increase in commodity prices throughout  as well as quantities on hand to service the increase in sales in over also contributed to usage of cash for inventory 
the other significant use of cash from to was in accounts receivable 
over the same period  consolidated sales increased by  or approximately  while total accounts receivable increased by  or approximately 
the use of cash was disproportionate to the increase in accounts receivable due to the decrease in days sales outstanding from days at december  to days at december   which reflected improved collection efforts 
partially offsetting the usage of cash for inventory and accounts receivable was a source of cash of  due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase in payables was less than the increase in inventory  as the crops purchased in the fourth quarter have short payment terms  and increased inventory levels at year end 
cash used in investing activities in was  compared to  in similar to  the primary uses of cash were to fund acquisitions  in compared to  in  and the purchase of property  plant and equipment  in compared to  in 
we acquired four business in compared to six in  the details of which are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
purchases of property  plant and equipment were higher than in  primarily in the fruit group and the distribution group 
the increase in the fruit group was the result of bar forming equipment within our healthy fruit snack business  in order to produce the healthy fruit snacks 
increases in the distribution group were the result of the construction of a warehousing facility in western canada  which merged three former distribution facilities under a single roof 
the remaining use of cash in included  for patents  trademarks and other intangible assets  of which  was for the herbon trade name  and  relating to advances to a supplier to assist with and secure product from the harvest season 
cash provided from financing activities in was  compared to  in the  increase over was the result of an equity offering of  common shares that occurred in february which generated  and private placement of preferred shares by sunopta bioprocess inc which contributed  of cash

sunopta inc december  k management believes that consumer demand for high quality natural and organic food has grown rapidly over the past decade as global awareness of the benefits of healthy eating continues to proliferate 
the global market for organic foods is currently estimated by management to be in excess of billion with historical growth rates between and depending on product line and country 
while growth rates are expected to slow during the current economic downturn the long term trends for growth remain in place 
while a large number of companies compete within specific segments of the market  we believe there are relatively few companies as well positioned as sunopta to take advantage of this rapidly growing market 
we believe that our vertically integrated seed to table business model built over the past nine years has positioned sunopta as a global leader in the natural and organic foods and natural health products markets 
for we expect to realize revenue and unit growth compared to  resulting from new product offerings  new and expanding customer relationships and expanded processing capabilities including our new soy processing and packaging operation in modesto  california which is expected to be operational late in the second quarter of the incremental revenues are expected to be offset somewhat by reduced canadian and european revenues resulting from the decline in these currencies as compared to the us dollar and a decline in certain commodity prices which are ultimately reflected in selling prices 
we believe that customers will continue to focus on health conscious natural  organic and specialty foods and natural health products during these turbulent economic times and feels sunopta is well positioned to meet the needs of these growing markets 
we expect that net earnings for will improve versus as a result of improved volumes  pricing and product mix  plus the impact of capacity expansion  cost reduction and rationalization initiatives  many of which have now been implemented  fixed cost leverage and the avoidance of certain professional fees and severance costs incurred in which are not expected to reoccur in our primary focus for remains the improvement of operating margins and returns on assets employed 
as a direct result of the current uncertain and rapidly changing world wide macroeconomic conditions  we have decided to take a cautious and responsible approach with regards to providing guidance  and in doing so  will not provide specific revenue and net earnings guidance at this time 
recent events are expected to delay  but not cease  our acquisition based growth strategy 
increased focus on margin improvement  improved internal controls and centralization of key services were key initiatives in and continue in management will continue to be heavily focused on executing working capital reductions  which is expected to increase available cash resources and alleviate some of the interest burden we incur on its existing debt facilities 
in  management added key experienced operational personnel in both the sunopta fruit group and at the corporate level to help drive these initiatives 
our overall strategy remains intact and the goal of profitable growth through an effective balance of internal growth and acquisitions in support of its vertically integrated seed to table strategy has not changed 
we continue to look for ways to improve the strategic synergies across our food group operations  vertically integrating wherever possible 
initiatives to improve the productivity of the operations include product rationalization  plant and warehouse rationalization programs  continued training and development of employees  consolidated procurement  supply chain and internal services programs and consolidated information and accounting systems to provide better analysis and timely decision making 
a more fulsome discussion of key strategies is included in item of this report 
maintaining liquidity and having available sources of cash will be imperative to continue our growth 
at december  we had  in cash  of which  may only be used within sunopta bioprocess and  within opta minerals inc we also had approximately  in unused bank lines for a total of  in cash and borrowings available 
sunopta  including opta minerals  also has unused revolving acquisition lines totaling approximately  our remaining cash and unused lines plus cash generated from operations are sufficient to finance capital maintenance estimated at  to  annual debt service of  and payment of the remaining current portion of long term liabilities of  additional sources of cash could be obtained through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing  a private or public offering  or the issuance of shares in relation to an acquisition or through a divestiture 
off balance sheet arrangements there are currently no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition 
sunopta inc december  k contractual obligations the table a below sets out our obligation under long term debt  operating and capital leases including interest costs  commitments to purchase grains  commodity and foreign exchange derivative contracts and long term liabilities  at december  thereafter total long term debt capital leases grain purchase commitments operating leases interest on long term debt b commodity foreign exchange contracts long term liabilities interest rate swap total a this table does not include certain contingent consideration related to acquisitions that may become payable if predetermined profit targets are achieved 
also  in the event that a qualified initial public offering does not occur by june   the preferred shares issued in conjunction with the sunopta bioprocess private placement would represent a liability to bioprocess inc of  at that time 
b interest is calculated based on scheduled repayments over the periods as indicated  using existing interest rates at december  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and limit risk 
to achieve this objective  we may invest excess cash in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
as at december  all of sunopta s excess funds were held in cash and cash equivalents with a maturity less than days 
debt in both fixed rate and floating rate interest carry different types of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt may have their fair market value adversely affected by a decline in interest rates 
in general  longer term debts are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter term securities 
floating rate term debt gives less predictability to cash flows as interest rates change 
as at december   the weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate term debt was and   of our outstanding term debt is at fixed interest rates 
at december   variable rate term debt of   carried a weighted average interest rate of 
we look at various factors to determine the percentage of debt to hold at fixed rates  including the interest rate spread between variable and fixed swap rates  our view on interest rate trends  the percent of offset to variable rate debt through holding variable rate investments and our ability to manage with interest rate volatility and uncertainty 
for every increase decrease in interest rates our after tax earnings would increase decrease by approximately  
opta minerals entered into a cash flow hedge in at inception  the fair value of the cash flow hedge was determined to be a loss of  using mark to market valuations which required an immediate expense of the ineffective portion 
the cash flow hedge entered into exchanged a notional amount of cdn  us  from a floating rate to a fixed rate of from august to august the fair value of the hedging derivative is estimated based on the standard swap valuation methodology 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a loss of  resulting in a   loss for the period  net of tax 
sunopta inc december  k foreign currency risk all us subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency and the us dollar is also our reporting currency 
the functional currency of all operations located in canada is the canadian dollar except for sunopta bioprocess and opta minerals  where the functional currency is the us dollar 
the functional currency of all operations located in europe is the euro except for opta minerals where the functional currency is the us dollar 
for these operations  all transaction gains or losses in relation to the us dollar are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income while gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
the functional currency of the corporate head office is the us dollar 
for the corporate office transaction gains or losses as well as translation gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are recorded within foreign exchange on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of sunopta and its canadian and european subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
during  the canadian dollar depreciated significantly against the us dollar with closing rates moving from cdn at december  to cdn at december  for each us dollar 
during  the euro depreciated against the us dollar with closing rates moving from at december  to at december  for each euro 
during  we had an increase of cdn   in net canadian assets and an increase of  in net euro based assets due to the acquisition of toc on april  a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates in favour of against the canadian dollar or euro with all other variables held constant would result in an increase decrease in the fair value of our net assets by   for a canadian dollar exchange movement and  nil for a euro exchange movement 
us based food group operations have limited exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
the canadian based subsidiaries have significant transaction exposure as their sales are predominantly in canadian dollars while a substantial portion of their purchases are in u 
s dollars 
the european operations are also exposed to various currencies as they purchase product from a wide variety of countries in several currencies and primarily sell into the european market 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
open forward foreign exchange contracts were marked to market at december  resulting in a loss of  nil  which is included in foreign exchange on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
in  we began taking a more active role in an attempt to reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts 
the contracts entered into are primarily canadian dollars and us dollars as well as us dollars and euros 
the net effect of all exchange based transactions including realized foreign exchange contracts  unrealized open contracts and all other foreign exchange transactions including the translation gains and losses related to our corporate net monetary assets are recorded in foreign exchange on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of   commodity risk the food group enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to our assessment of its exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose us to risk in the event that a counter party to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
we manage risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved producers 
sunopta inc december  k we have a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the grain as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market as they do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
at december  we owned   bushels of corn with a weighted average price of and   bushels of soy beans with a weighted average price of 
at december   we had a net long position on soy beans of   and a net long short position on corn of   bushels 
an increase decrease in the commodity prices of either soy and corn of would result in an increase decrease in carrying value of these commodities by  
there are no futures contracts in the other sunopta food group segments  opta minerals  sunopta bioprocess or related to corporate office activities
