item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our acquisition strategy requires access to new capital 
tightened capital markets or increased competition for investment opportunities could impair our ability to grow through acquisitions 
we continuously consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions 
any limitations on our access to capital will impair our ability to execute this strategy 
if the cost of such capital becomes too expensive  our ability to develop or acquire strategic and accretive assets will be limited 
we may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms  if at all 
the primary factors that influence our initial cost of equity include market conditions  fees we pay to underwriters and other offering costs  which include amounts we pay for legal and accounting services 
the primary factors influencing our cost of borrowing include interest rates  credit spreads  covenants  underwriting or loan origination fees and similar charges we pay to lenders 
current weak economic conditions and the volatility and disruption in the weak financial markets have increased the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets substantially while diminishing the availability of funds from those markets 
also  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to our current debt and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
these factors may impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
in addition  we typically experience competitive bidding for the types of assets we contemplate purchasing 
the weak economic conditions and competition for asset purchases could limit our ability to fully execute our growth strategy 
our inability to execute our growth strategy could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain or pay higher distributions in the future 

table of contents we may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances  hydrocarbons or wastes into the environment 
our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
for more information on our operations  see item business our systems for additional information on our operations 
these laws include  for example  the federal clean air act and comparable state laws that impose obligations related to air emissions  the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the handling  storage  treatment or disposal of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla also known as superfund  and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which our hazardous substances have been transported for disposal and the federal water pollution control act the clean water act and comparable state laws that regulate discharges of wastewater from our facilities to state and federal waters 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or newly adopted laws or regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations 
certain environmental laws  including cercla and analogous state laws  impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or hydrocarbons have been disposed or otherwise released 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances  hydrocarbons or waste products into the environment 
there is inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to our handling of natural gas and other petroleum products  air emissions and water discharges related to our operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
for example  an accidental release from one of our facilities could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury  natural resource and property damages and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
moreover  the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our operational or compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
in particular  we may incur expenditures in order to attain or maintain compliance with legal requirements governing emissions of air pollutants from our facilities 
we may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance

a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal  state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets  which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 
the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by ferc as a natural gas company under the nga 
we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company 
however  the distinction between ferc regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial  on going litigation  so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc  the courts or congress 
while our natural gas gathering operations are generally exempt from ferc regulation under the nga  our gas gathering operations may be subject to certain ferc reporting and posting requirements in a given year 
ferc has recently issued a final rule as amended by orders on rehearing  order requiring certain participants in the natural gas market  including intrastate pipelines  natural gas gatherers  natural gas marketers and natural gas processors  that engage in a minimum level of natural gas sales or purchases to submit annual reports regarding those transactions to ferc 
in addition  ferc has issued a final rule order requiring major non interstate pipelines  defined as certain non interstate pipelines delivering  on an annual basis  more than an average of million mmbtus of gas over the previous three calendar years  to post daily certain information regarding the pipeline s capacity and scheduled flows for each receipt and delivery point that has design capacity equal to or greater than  mmbtu per day 

table of contents other ferc regulations may indirectly impact our businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses 
ferc s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities  including  for example  its policies on open access transportation  gas quality  ratemaking  capacity release and market center promotion  may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas market 
in recent years  ferc has pursued pro competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines 
however  we cannot assure you that ferc will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to transportation capacity 
for more information regarding the regulation of targa s operations  see item business regulation of operations 
should we fail to comply with all applicable ferc administered statutes  rules  regulations and orders  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 
under the ep act  ferc has civil penalty authority under the nga to impose penalties for current violations of up to million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation 
while our systems have not been regulated by ferc as a natural gas companies under the nga  ferc has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non ferc jurisdictional facilities to ferc annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time 
failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject targa to civil penalty liability

unexpected volume changes due to production variability or to gathering  plant or pipeline system disruptions may increase our exposure to commodity price movements 
targa sells our processed natural gas to third parties and other targa affiliates at our plant tailgates or at pipeline pooling points 
targa also manages the saou and lou systems natural gas sales to third parties under contracts that remain in the name of the saou and lou systems 
sales made to natural gas marketers and end users may be interrupted by disruptions to volumes anywhere along the system 
targa will attempt to balance sales with volumes supplied from our processing operations  but unexpected volume variations due to production variability or to gathering  plant or pipeline system disruptions may expose us to volume imbalances which  in conjunction with movements in commodity prices  could materially impact our income from operations and cash flow 
we may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity programs and related repairs 
pursuant to the pipeline safety improvement act of  as reauthorized and amended by the pipeline inspections  protection  enforcement and safety act of  dot  through the phmsa  has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transmission pipelines located where a leak or rupture could do the most harm in high consequence areas  including high population areas  areas that are sources of drinking water  ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release and commercially navigable waterways  unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area 
the regulations require operators of covered pipelines to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity  identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area  improve data collection  integration and analysis  repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary  and implement preventive and mitigating actions 

table of contents in addition  states have adopted regulations similar to existing us dot regulations for intrastate gathering and transmission lines 
we currently estimate that we will incur an aggregate cost of approximately million between and to implement pipeline integrity management program testing along certain segments of our natural gas and ngl pipelines 
this estimate does not include the costs  if any  of any repair  remediation  preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program  which costs could be substantial 
at this time  we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with this regulation  as the cost will vary significantly depending on the number and extent of any repairs found to be necessary as a result of the pipeline integrity testing 
following the initial round of testing and repairs  we will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity or our pipelines 
the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operations of our pipelines 
our construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and is subject to regulatory  environmental  political  legal and economic risks  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
one of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new midstream assets 
the construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets  involve numerous regulatory  environmental  political and legal uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital 
if we undertake these projects  they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost or at all 
moreover  our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for instance  if we expand a new pipeline  the construction may occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until the project is completed 
moreover  we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize 
since we are not engaged in the exploration for and development of natural gas and oil reserves  we do not possess reserve expertise and we often do not have access to third party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing facilities in such area 
to the extent we rely on estimates of future production in our decision to construct additions to our systems  such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production 
as a result  new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the construction of additions to our existing gathering and transportation assets may require us to obtain new rights of way prior to constructing new pipelines 
we may be unable to obtain such rights of way to connect new natural gas supplies to our existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities 
additionally  it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights of way or to renew existing rights of way 
if the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights of way increases  our cash flows could be adversely affected 
if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or efficiently and effectively integrate the acquired assets with our asset base  our future growth will be limited 
our ability to grow depends  in part  on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in cash generated from operations per unit 
if we are unable to make these accretive acquisitions either because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them  unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or outbid by competitors  then our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including  among other things inaccurate assumptions about volumes  revenues and costs  including synergies  an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire  the assumption of unknown liabilities  limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller  inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt  the diversion of management s and employees attention from other business concerns  
table of contents unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas  and customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses 
if these risks materialize  the acquired assets may inhibit our growth or fail to deliver expected benefits 
our acquisition strategy is based  in part  on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of energy assets by industry participants 
a material decrease in such divestitures would limit our opportunities for future acquisitions and could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders 
we do not have any officers or employees and rely solely on officers of our general partner and employees of targa 
none of the officers of our general partner are employees of our general partner 
we have entered into an omnibus agreement with targa  pursuant to which targa operates our assets and performs other administrative services for us such as accounting  legal  regulatory  corporate development  finance  land and engineering 
affiliates of targa conduct businesses and activities of their own in which we have no economic interest  including businesses and activities relating to targa 
as a result  there could be material competition for the time and effort of the officers and employees who provide services to our general partner and targa 
if the officers of our general partner and the employees of targa do not devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of our business  our financial results may suffer and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be reduced 
if our general partner fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls  then we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our common units 
targa resources gp llc  our general partner  has sole responsibility for conducting our business and for managing our operations 
effective internal controls are necessary for our general partner  on our behalf  to provide reliable financial reports  prevent fraud and operate us successfully as a public company 
if our general partner s efforts to develop and maintain its internal controls are not successful  it is unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or it is unable to assist us in complying with our obligations under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations 
ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units 
the amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our common units and subordinated units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability 
consequently  even if we are profitable  we may not be able to make cash distributions to holders of our common units and subordinated units 
you should be aware that the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow and not solely on profitability  which will be affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net earnings for financial accounting purposes 
terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks  have resulted in increased costs to our business 
continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations 
the long term impact of terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september  and the threat of future terrorist attacks on our industry in general and on us in particular  is not known at this time 
however  resulting regulatory requirements and or related business decisions associated with security are likely to increase our costs 
increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business 
uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of crude oil supplies and markets for our products and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of or indirect casualties of  an act of terror 

table of contents changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
moreover  the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital 
risks inherent in an investment in us cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and the establishment of financial reserves 
because distributions on the common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate  distributions may fluctuate based on our performance 
the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control and the control of the general partner 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits 
in order to make cash distributions at our current distribution rate of per common unit and subordinated unit per complete quarter or per unit per year  we will require available cash of approximately million per quarter or million per year  based on common units and subordinated units outstanding as of december  we may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to enable us to make cash distributions at our current distribution rate under our cash distribution policy 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the fees we charge and the margins we realize for our services  the prices of  levels of production of and demand for  natural gas and ngls  the volume of natural gas we gather  treat  compress  process  transport and sell and the volume of ngls we process or fractionate and sell  the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices  cash settlements of hedging positions  the level of competition from other midstream energy companies  the level of our operating and maintenance and general and administrative costs  and prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the level of capital expenditures we make  our ability to make borrowings under our credit facility to pay distributions  the cost of acquisitions  our debt service requirements and other liabilities  fluctuations in our working capital needs  
table of contents general and administrative expenses  including expenses we incur as a result of being a public company  restrictions on distributions contained in our debt agreements  and the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner for the proper conduct of our business 
targa controls our general partner  which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations 
targa has conflicts of interest with us and may favor its own interests to your detriment 
targa owns and controls our general partner 
some of our general partner s directors and some of its executive officers  are directors or officers of targa 
therefore  conflicts of interest may arise between targa  including our general partner  on the one hand and us and our unitholders  on the other hand 
in resolving these conflicts of interest  our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders 
these conflicts include  among others  the following situations neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires targa to pursue a business strategy that favors us 
targa s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interests of the owners of targa  which may be contrary to our interests  our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us  such as targa or its owners  including warburg pincus  in resolving conflicts of interest  and targa is not limited in its ability to compete with us and is under no obligation to offer assets to us 
the credit and business risk profile of our general partner and its owners could adversely affect our credit ratings and profile 
the credit and business risk profiles of the general partner and its owners may be factors in credit evaluations of a master limited partnership 
this is because the general partner can exercise significant influence over the business activities of the partnership  including its cash distribution and acquisition strategy and business risk profile 
another factor that may be considered is the financial condition of the general partner and its owners  including the degree of their financial leverage and their dependence on cash flow from the partnership to service their indebtedness 
targa  the owner of our general partner  has significant indebtedness outstanding and is partially dependent on the cash distributions from their indirect general partner and limited partner equity interests in us to service such indebtedness 
any distributions by us to such entities will be made only after satisfying our then current obligations to our creditors 
our credit ratings and business risk profile could be adversely affected if the ratings and risk profiles of the entities that control our general partner were viewed as substantially lower or more risky than ours 
our partnership agreement limits our general partner s fiduciary duties to holders of our units and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to its owner  targa 
our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty laws 
for example  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity  as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner 
this entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting  us  our affiliates or any limited partner  provides that our general partner does not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith  meaning it believed the decision was in the best interests of our partnership  
table of contents generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner acting in good faith and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or must be fair and reasonable to us  as determined by our general partner in good faith and that  in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable  our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved  including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us  provides that our general partner and its officers and directors are not liable for monetary damages to us  our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or  in the case of a criminal matter  acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal  and provides that in resolving conflicts of interest  it is presumed that in making its decision the general partner acted in good faith and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or us  the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption 
targa is not limited in its ability to compete with us  which could limit our ability to acquire additional assets or businesses 
neither our partnership agreement nor the omnibus agreement between us and targa prohibits targa from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us 
in addition  targa may acquire  construct or dispose of additional midstream or other assets in the future  without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct any of those assets 
targa is a large  established participant in the midstream energy business and has significantly greater resources and experience than we have  which factors may make it more difficult for us to compete with targa with respect to commercial activities as well as for acquisition candidates 
as a result  competition from targa could adversely impact our results of operations and cash available for distribution 
cost reimbursements due our general partner and its affiliates for services provided  which will be determined by our general partner  will be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement we entered into with targa and targa resources gp llc  our general partner  targa receives reimbursement for the payment of operating expenses related to our operations and for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit 
payments for these services are substantial and reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders 
see item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
in addition  under delaware partnership law  our general partner has unlimited liability for our obligations  such as our debts and environmental liabilities  except for our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner 
to the extent our general partner incurs obligations on our behalf  we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner 
if we are unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify our general partner  our general partner may take actions to cause us to make payments on these obligations and liabilities 
any such payments could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders 
holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and  therefore  limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 
unitholders will not elect our general partner or our general partner s board of directors and have no right to elect our general partner or our general partner s board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis 
the board of directors of our general partner is chosen by targa 
furthermore  if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner  they have little ability to remove our general partner 
as a result of these limitations  the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price 

table of contents removal of our general partner without its consent will dilute and adversely affect our common unitholders 
if our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and units held by our general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal  all remaining subordinated units will automatically convert into common units and any existing arrearages on our common units will be extinguished 
a removal of our general partner under these circumstances would adversely affect our common units by prematurely eliminating their distribution and liquidation preference over our subordinated units  which would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and performance tests 
cause is narrowly defined to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final  non appealable judgment finding the general partner liable for actual fraud or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner 
cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business  so the removal of the general partner because of the unitholder s dissatisfaction with our general partner s performance in managing our partnership will most likely result in the termination of the subordination period and conversion of all subordinated units to common units 
we may issue additional units without your approval  which would dilute your existing ownership interests 
our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders 
the issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease  because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units  the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase  the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished  and the market price of the common units may decline 
affiliates of our general partner may sell common units in the public markets  which sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units 
management of our general partner and targa beneficially hold  common units and  subordinated units 
all of the subordinated units will convert into common units at the end of the subordination period and may convert earlier 
the sale of these units in the public markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop 
our general partner may elect to cause us to issue class b units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our general partner s incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of our general partner or holders of our common units 
this ability may result in lower distributions to holders of our common units in certain situations 
our general partner has the right  at a time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters  to reset the initial cash target distribution levels at higher levels based on the distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election 
following a reset election by our general partner  the minimum quarterly distribution amount will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution amount per common unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election such amount is referred to as the reset minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution amount 

table of contents in connection with resetting these target distribution levels  our general partner will be entitled to receive class b units 
the class b units will be entitled to the same cash distributions per unit as our common units and will be convertible into an equal number of common units 
the number of class b units to be issued will be equal to that number of common units whose aggregate quarterly cash distributions equaled the average of the distributions to our general partner on the incentive distribution rights in the prior two quarters 
we anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion  however  it is possible that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing or may be expected to experience  declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued our class b units  which are entitled to receive cash distributions from us on the same priority as our common units  rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels 
as a result  a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued new class b units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels related to our general partner s incentive distribution rights 
increases in interest rates could adversely impact our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions  for expansion capital expenditures or for other purposes 
as with other yield oriented securities  our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield 
the distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield oriented securities for investment decision making purposes 
therefore  changes in interest rates  either positive or negative  may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions  for expansion capital expenditures or for other purposes 
our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning or more of our common units 
unitholders voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision providing that any units held by a person that owns or more of any class of units then outstanding  other than our general partner  its affiliates  their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner  cannot vote on any matter 
our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management 
control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent 
our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders 
furthermore  our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the owners of our general partner from transferring all or a portion of their respective ownership interest in our general partner to a third party 
the new owners of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own choices and thereby influence the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers 
our general partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your units at an undesirable time or price 
if at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than of the common units  our general partner will have the right  but not the obligation  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then current market price 
as a result  you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment 
you may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units 
at the end of the subordination period  assuming no additional issuances of common units  our general partner and its affiliates will own approximately of our aggregate outstanding common units 

table of contents your liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business 
a general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership  except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner 
our partnership is organized under delaware law and we conduct business in louisiana and texas 
the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business 
you could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if you were a general partner if a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state s partnership statute  or your right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace the general partner  to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business 
unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them 
under certain circumstances  unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them 
under section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act  we may not make a distribution to you if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution  limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount 
substituted limited partners are liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the partnership agreement 
liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
tax risks to common unitholders our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service or irs  were to treat us as a corporation or if we were to become subject to a material amount of entity level taxation for state tax purposes  then our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
in order to maintain our status as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes  or more of our gross income in each tax year must be qualifying income under section of the internal revenue code 
we have not requested and do not plan to request  a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have requested a ruling from the irs with respect to the qualifying nature of the income earned as a result of a purchase of our debt at a discount upon which  if granted  we may rely with respect to such income 
there can be no assurance that the irs will provide such a favorable ruling 
however  any income earned as a result of a purchase or our debt at a discount plus any other non qualifying income we earned in is less than of our total gross income 
although we do not believe based upon our current operations that we are treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  a change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates 
distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to you 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced 
therefore  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to the unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units 

table of contents current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
at the federal level  members of congress have considered substantive changes to the existing us tax laws that would have affected certain publicly traded partnerships 
although the legislation considered would not have appeared to affect our tax treatment  we are unable to predict whether any such change or other proposals will ultimately be enacted 
moreover  any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively 
any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units 
at the state level  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise and other forms of taxation 
for example  we are required to pay texas franchise tax at a maximum effective rate of of our gross income apportioned to texas in the prior year 
imposition of any such tax on us by any other state will reduce the cash available for distribution to you 
our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations 
if the irs were to challenge this method or new treasury regulations were issued  we may be required to change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
if the irs contests the federal income tax positions we take  the market for our common units may be adversely affected and the cost of any contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution 
you may be required to pay taxes on your share of our income even if you do not receive any cash distributions from us 
because our unitholders are treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute  you may be required to pay any federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on your share of our taxable income even if you receive no cash distributions from us 
you may not receive cash distributions from us equal to your share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income 

table of contents tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected 
if you sell your common units  you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those common units 
prior distributions to you in excess of the total net taxable income you were allocated for a common unit  which decreased your tax basis in that common unit  will  in effect  become taxable income to you if the common unit is sold at a price greater than your tax basis in that common unit  even if the price you receive is less than your original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be ordinary income due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized includes a unitholder s share of our non recourse liabilities  if you sell your units  you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale 
tax exempt entities and non united states persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as individual retirement accounts known as iras  other retirement plans and non united states persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non united states persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate and non united states persons will be required to file us federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
if you are a tax exempt entity or a non united states person  you should consult your tax advisor before investing in our common units 
we treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons  we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations and may result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns 
a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units 
if so  he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units  he may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units 

table of contents we have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of our common units 
when we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions  we will determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  under our valuation methods  subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their internal revenue code section b adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our valuation methods or our allocation of the section b adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve month period 
for purposes of determining whether the threshold has been met  multiple sales of the same interest are counted only once 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders  which would result in us filing two tax returns and our unitholders could receive two schedules k for one fiscal year and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination 
our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  but instead  we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes 
if treated as a new partnership  we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine in a timely manner that a termination occurred 
you may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where you do not live as a result of investing in our common units 
in addition to federal income taxes  you may be subject to return filing requirements and other taxes  including state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property  now or in the future  even if you do not live in any of those jurisdictions 
further  you may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we own assets and conduct business in the states of texas and louisiana 
currently  texas does not impose a personal income tax on individuals 
as we make acquisitions or expand our business  we may own assets or do business in states that impose a personal income tax

the following table sets forth the high and low sales prices of the common units  as reported by nasdaq  as well as the amount of cash distributions declared for the period february  through december  distribution distribution per common per subordinated quarter ended high low unit unit december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  as of february   there were approximately unitholders of record of our common units 
this number does not include unitholders whose units are held in trust by other entities 
the actual number of unitholders is greater than the number of holders of record 
we have also issued  subordinated units  for which there is no established public trading market 
the subordinated units are held by affiliates of targa resources gp llc  our general partner 
our general partner and its affiliates will receive a quarterly distribution on these units only after sufficient funds have been paid to the common units 
there is no established trading market for the  general partner units held by our general partner 
distributions of available cash general 
our partnership agreement requires that  within days after the end of each quarter  we distribute all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the applicable record date  as determined by our general partner 
definition of available cash 
the term available cash  for any quarter  means all cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of available cash for that quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner to provide for the proper conduct of our business  comply with applicable law  any of our debt instruments or other agreements  or provide funds for distribution to our unitholders and to our general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters 

table of contents minimum quarterly distribution 
we intend to make cash distributions to the holders of common units and subordinated units on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to at least the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit or per unit on an annualized basis  to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
however  there is no guarantee that we will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on the units in any quarter 
even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or revoked  the amount of distributions paid under our policy and the decision to make any distribution is determined by our general partner  taking into consideration the terms of our partnership agreement 
the board of directors of our general partner has broad discretion to establish cash reserves that it determines are necessary or appropriate to properly conduct our business 
these can include cash reserves for future capital and maintenance expenditures  reserves to stabilize distributions of cash to our unitholders  reserves to reduce debt or  as necessary  reserves to comply with the term of any of our agreements or obligations 
we will be prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if it would cause an event of default or an event of default exists  under our credit agreement or indenture 
general partner interest 
our general partner is currently entitled to of all quarterly distributions that we make prior to our liquidation 
this general partner interest is represented by  general partner units 
our general partner has the right  but not the obligation  to contribute a proportional amount of capital to us to maintain its current general partner interest 
the general partner s interest in these distributions will be reduced if we issue additional units in the future and our general partner does not contribute a proportional amount of capital to us to maintain its general partner interest 
incentive distribution rights 
our general partner also currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive up to a maximum of of the cash we distribute in excess of per unit per quarter 
the maximum distribution of includes distributions paid to our general partner on its general partner interest and assumes that our general partner maintains its general partner interest at 
the maximum distribution of does not include any distributions that our general partner may receive on limited partner units that it owns 
recent sales of unregistered units none repurchase of equity by targa resources partners lp on october   the board of directors of our general partner approved a program for us to repurchase up to million in value of our common units from time to time through december  in open market transactions  including block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions 
the unit repurchase program authorizes us to make repurchases on a discretionary basis as determined by our management subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  available liquidity and other appropriate factors as determined by such officers 
the unit repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be modified or suspended at any time and could be terminated prior to completion 
repurchased common units will be cancelled and current payments on our incentive distribution rights will decrease 
there have been no repurchases of our common units under this program

table of contents the economic substance behind management s use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make distributions to our investors 
the generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net cash provided by operating activities and net income 
our non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net cash provided by operating activities and gaap net income 
adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

table of contents includes non cash charges related to commodity hedges of million  million and million for  and distributable cash flow 
distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and others to compare basic cash flows generated by us prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the board of directors of our general partner to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this metric  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
distributable cash flow is also an important non gaap financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and limited liability companies because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit s yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder 
the economic substance behind our use of distributable cash flow is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash flow sufficient to make distributions to our investors

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on february   targa contributed its ownership interests in the north texas system to us 
on october   we acquired targa s ownership interests in the saou system and the lou system 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas  we accounted for these transactions as transfers of net assets between entities under common control 
for combinations of entities under common control  the purchase cost provisions as they relate to purchase business combinations involving unrelated entities of sfas explicitly do not apply  instead the method of accounting prescribed by sfas for such transfers is similar to the pooling of interests method of accounting 
under this method  the carrying amount of net assets recognized in the balance sheets of each combining entity are carried forward to the balance sheet of the combined entity and no other assets or liabilities are recognized as a result of the combination that is  no recognition is made for a purchase premium or discount representing any difference between the cash consideration paid and the book value of the net assets acquired 
in connection with our ipo  the north texas system was presented as our predecessor entity 
as a result of our october acquisition of the saou and lou systems  the predecessor entity for us is now considered to be the net assets of the saou and lou systems as these were the first assets acquired by targa on april  therefore  subsequent to the contribution of the north texas system from targa on february   we recognized the assets and liabilities of the north texas system contributed to us at their carrying amounts historical cost in the accounts of the saou and lou systems the predecessor entity at the date of transfer 
the accounting treatment for combinations of entities under common control is consistent with the concept of poolings as combinations of common shareholder or unitholder interests 
in addition to requiring that assets and liabilities be carried forward at historical costs  sfas also prescribes that for transfers of net assets between entities under common control  all income statements presented be combined as of the date of common control 
accordingly  our historical results include the historical results of the saou and lou systems acquired by targa effective april  for  and  and the historical results of the north texas system acquired by targa effective november  subsequent to october  the following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our historical financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed by targa to own  operate  acquire and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary midstream energy assets 
we are engaged in the business of gathering  compressing  treating  processing and selling natural gas and fractionating and selling ngls and ngl products 
we currently operate in the fort worth basin in north texas  the permian basin in west texas and in southwest louisiana 
we are owned by our limited partners and by our general partner  targa resources gp llc  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of targa 
our limited partner common units are publicly traded on the nasdaq stock market llc under the symbol ngls 
factors that significantly affect our results our results of operations are substantially impacted by changes in commodity prices as well as increases and decreases in the volume of natural gas that we gather  which we refer to as throughput volume 
throughput volumes and capacity utilization rates generally are driven by wellhead production  our competitive position on a regional basis and more broadly by prices and demand for natural gas and ngls 
contract mix 
our processing contract arrangements can have a significant impact on our profitability 
we generate revenue based on the contractual arrangements we have with our producer customers 
these arrangements can be in many forms which vary in the amount of commodity price risk they carry 
substantially all of our revenues are generated under percent of proceeds arrangements pursuant to which we receive a portion of the natural gas and or ngls as payment for services 
below is a table summarizing our average contract mix for  including the potential impacts of changes in commodity prices on operating margins 
table of contents contract type percent of throughput impact of commodity prices percent of proceeds decreases in natural gas and or ngl prices generate decreases in operating margin 
wellhead purchases keep whole increases in natural gas prices relative to ngl prices generate decreases in operating margin 
decreases in ngl prices relative to natural gas prices generate decreases in operating margin 
hybrid in periods of favorable processing economics  similar to percent of proceeds or wellhead purchases keep whole in some circumstances  if economically advantageous to the processor 
in periods of unfavorable processing economics  similar to fee based 
fee based no direct impact from commodity price movements 
actual contract terms are based upon a variety of factors  including natural gas quality  geographic location and the competitive commodity and pricing environment at the time the contract is executed and customer requirements 
our gathering and processing contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of producer preferences  competition and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added  our expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common as well as other market factors 
we prefer to enter into contracts with less commodity price sensitivity  including fee based and percent of proceeds arrangements 
we attempt to mitigate the price risk associated with our contract mix through hedging activities which can materially impact our results of operations

in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas  ngls and condensate equity volumes for the years through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
with these arrangements  we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements with respect to our forecasted volumes for this period

general and administrative expenses 
prior to the contribution of the assets of the north texas system to us and the acquisition of the assets from the saou and lou systems by us from targa  general and administrative expenses were allocated from targa to the north texas  saou and lou systems in accordance with the general and administrative expenses allocation policies of targa 
on february   we entered into an omnibus agreement with targa  pursuant to which our allocated general and administrative expenses related to the north texas system were capped at million per year for three years  subject to adjustment 
on october   we amended and restated our omnibus agreement with targa the omnibus agreement 
the omnibus agreement governs certain relationships between targa and us  including targa s obligation to provide certain general and administrative services to us  our obligation to reimburse targa and its affiliates for the provision of general and administrative services a subject to a cap of million relating solely to the north texas system in the first year  with increases in the subsequent two years based on a formula specified in the omnibus agreement and b fully allocated as to the saou and lou systems according to targa s previously established allocation practices  our obligation to reimburse targa and its affiliates for direct expenses incurred on our behalf  and 
table of contents targa s obligation to indemnify us for certain liabilities and our obligation to indemnify targa for certain liabilities 
allocated general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for  and for a more complete description of this agreement  see item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence omnibus agreement 
in addition to these allocated general and administrative expenses  we incur incremental general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a separate publicly held limited partnership 
these direct  incremental general and administrative expenses  which were approximately million and million during and  including one time expenses associated with our equity offerings  financing arrangements and acquisitions were not subject to the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
these costs include costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to unitholders  tax return and schedule k preparation and distribution  independent auditor fees  registrar and transfer agent fees and independent director compensation 
these incremental general and administrative expenditures are not reflected in the historical financial statements of the north texas  saou and lou systems 
the historical financial statements of the saou and lou systems and the north texas system include certain items that will not impact our future results of operations and liquidity including the items described below affiliate indebtedness and borrowings 
affiliate indebtedness prior to our acquisition of the saou and lou systems and the contribution of the north texas system  consisted of borrowings incurred by targa and allocated to us for financial reporting purposes 
prior to targa s acquisition of dynegy s interest in dynegy midstream services  limited partnership the dms acquisition  which included the north texas system  the predecessor business was financed through borrowings by targa and reflected allocated indebtedness on its balance sheet and allocated interest expense on its income statement 
a substantial portion of the dms acquisition was also financed through borrowings by targa 
following the october  dms acquisition  a significant portion of targa s acquisition borrowings were allocated to the north texas system  resulting in approximately million of allocated indebtedness and corresponding levels of interest expense 
this indebtedness was incurred by targa in connection with the dms acquisition and the entity holding the north texas system provided a guarantee of this indebtedness 
this indebtedness was also secured by a collateral interest in both the equity of the entity holding the north texas system as well as its assets 
in connection with our ipo  this guarantee was terminated  the collateral interest was released and the allocated indebtedness was retired 
on february   we borrowed approximately million under our credit facility 
the proceeds from this borrowing  together with approximately million of net proceeds from our ipo including  common units sold pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional common units  were used to repay approximately million of affiliate indebtedness and the remaining balance of this indebtedness was retired and treated as a capital contribution to us 
on october   we completed our acquisition of the saou and lou systems concurrently with the sale of  common units representing limited partnership interests in us for gross proceeds of million approximately million after underwriting discount and structuring fees 
the net proceeds from the sale of the  units were used to pay approximately million in expenses associated with the sale of the common units and million to targa for certain hedge transactions associated with the saou and lou systems 
we used the net proceeds after offering expenses and the hedge transactions of million along with net borrowings of million to pay approximately million of the acquisition costs of the saou and lou systems 
the allocated indebtedness from targa related to the saou and lou systems was million 
targa debt was guaranteed by the entities that own the saou and lou systems and was secured by a collateral interest in both the equity interests of those entities as well as their underlying assets 
in conjunction with our acquisition of the saou and lou systems  this guarantee was terminated  the collateral interest was released and the allocated indebtedness was retired 

table of contents working capital adjustments 
prior to our ipo and the contribution of the north texas system in february and the acquisition of the saou and lou systems in october  all intercompany transactions  including commodity sales and expense reimbursements  were not cash settled with the predecessor business respective parent  but were recorded as an adjustment to parent equity on the balance sheet 
the primary intercompany transactions between the respective parent and the predecessor business are natural gas and ngl sales  the provision of operations and maintenance activities and the provision of general and administrative services 
accordingly  the working capital of the predecessor business does not reflect any affiliate accounts receivable for intercompany commodity sales or affiliate accounts payable for the personnel and services provided or paid for by the applicable parent on behalf of the predecessor business 
distributions to our unitholders 
we intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner at least at the minimum quarterly distribution rate of per common unit per quarter per common unit on an annualized basis 
due to our cash distribution policy  we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations 
as a result  we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources  including other debt and common unit issuances  to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures  as well as our working capital needs 
historically  we have relied on internally generated cash flows for these purposes 
due to the timing of our ipo  a pro rated distribution for the first quarter of of per common and subordinated unit was paid 
the following table shows the distributions we declared for the period february  through december  distributions paid distributions common subordinated general partner per limited date declared date paid units units incentive total partner unit in thousands  except per unit amounts october  november  july  august  april  may  january  february  october  november  july  august  april  may  on january   we declared a cash distribution of per unit on our outstanding common and subordinated units 
the distribution was paid on february  to unitholders of record on february   for the period october  through december  the total distribution paid was approximately million  with approximately million paid to our common unitholders and million and million paid to our general partner for its general partner and incentive distribution interests 
general trends and outlook we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends 
our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our expected results 
natural gas supply and outlook 
fluctuations in energy prices can affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new natural gas reserves 
generally  drilling and production activity will increase as natural gas prices increase and decrease as natural gas prices decrease 
the recent substantial decline in natural gas prices has led many exploration and production companies to reduce planned capital expenditures for drilling and production activities during which could lead to a decrease in the level of natural gas production in our areas of operation 

table of contents commodity prices 
our operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas  ngl and condensate prices  primarily as a result of our percent of proceeds contracts 
our processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which are beyond our control and have been volatile 
due to the recent volatility  we are uncertain of what pricing and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate will be throughout the current weak economic conditions have negatively affected the pricing and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which has caused a reduction in the profitability of our processing operations 
in a declining commodity price environment  without taking into account our hedges  we will realize a reduction in cash flows under our percent of proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines 
we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements by entering into hedging arrangements 
for additional information regarding our hedging activities  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
volatile capital markets 
we are dependent on our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets in order to fund acquisitions and expansion expenditures 
global financial markets have been and are expected to continue to be  extremely volatile and disrupted and the current weak economic conditions have recently caused a significant decline in commodity prices 
as a result  we may be unable to raise equity or debt capital on satisfactory terms or at all  which may negatively impact the timing and extent to which we execute growth plans 
prolonged periods of low commodity prices or volatile capital markets may impact our ability or willingness to enter into new hedges  fund organic growth  connect to new supplies of natural gas  execute acquisitions or implement expansion capital expenditures 
our operations our results of operations are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas gathered  compressed  treated  processed  moved and sold through our gathering  processing and pipeline systems  the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas sold  and the level of natural gas and ngl prices 
we generate our revenues and our operating margins principally under percent of proceeds contractual arrangements 
under these arrangements  we generally gather natural gas from producers at the wellhead or central delivery points  move the wellhead natural gas through our gathering system  treat and process the natural gas and then sell the resulting residue natural gas and ngls at published index market prices 
we remit to the producers either an agreed upon percentage of recovered volumes or the actual proceeds that we receive from our sales of the residue natural gas and ngls or an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on index related prices for the natural gas and ngls 
under these types of arrangements  our revenues correlate directly with the price of natural gas and ngls 
during  our percent of proceeds activities accounted for approximately of our natural gas throughput volumes 
the balance of our throughput volumes are processed under wellhead purchase contracts  keep whole contracts  fee based contracts and hybrid contractual arrangements 
we sell the majority of our processed natural gas  ngls and high pressure condensate to targa at market based rates pursuant to natural gas  ngl and condensate purchase agreements 
low pressure condensate is sold to third parties 
see item certain relationships and related transactions and director independence 
how we evaluate our operations our profitability is a function of the difference between the revenues we receive from our operations  including revenues from the natural gas  ngls and condensate we sell and the costs associated with conducting our operations  including the costs of wellhead natural gas that we purchase as well as operating and general and administrative costs 
because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs  increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability 
our contract portfolio  the prevailing pricing environment for natural gas and ngls and the natural gas and ngl throughput on our system are important factors in determining our profitability 
our profitability is also affected by the ngl content in gathered wellhead natural gas  demand for our products and changes in our customer mix 
our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include the following throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption  operating margin  operating expenses  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 

table of contents throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption 
our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of natural gas supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from natural gas wells that are connected to our systems 
this is achieved by connecting new wells  through additional volumes at existing central delivery points  as well as by capturing supplies currently gathered by third parties 
in addition  we seek to increase operating margins by limiting volume losses and reducing fuel consumption by increasing compression efficiency 
with our gathering systems extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities  we monitor the volumes of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points along our gathering systems  the volume of natural gas received at our processing plant inlets and the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas recovered by our processing plants 
this information is tracked through our processing plants to determine customer settlements and helps us increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption 
as part of monitoring the efficiency of our operations  we measure the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on our gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of our processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss 
we also track the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the ngls and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plants to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of the facilities 
these volume  recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of our operational efficiency analysis 
operating margin 
we review performance based on the non generally accepted accounting principle non gaap financial measure of operating margin 
we define operating margin as total operating revenues  which consist of natural gas and ngl sales plus service fee revenues  less product purchases  which consist primarily of producer payments and other natural gas purchases and operating expense 
natural gas and ngl sales revenue includes settlement gains and losses on commodity hedges 
our operating margin is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by our contract mix and hedging program  which are described in more detail below 
we view our operating margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
we review our operating margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to operating margin is net income 
our non gaap financial measure of operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income 
operating margin is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
you should not consider operating margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because operating margin excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing its utility 
we compensate for the limitations of operating margin as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measure  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into our decision making processes 
in millions reconciliation of net income to operating margin net income add depreciation and amortization expense deferred income tax expense allocated interest expense  net interest expense  net gain on extinguishment of debt gain loss related to derivatives general and administrative and other expense operating margin includes non cash charges related to commodity hedges of million  million and million for  and 
table of contents we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
operating margin provides useful information to investors because it is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements  including such investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
see item selected consolidated financial and operating data non gaap financial measures 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of a specific asset 
direct labor  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance  utilities and contract services compose the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses generally remain relatively stable independent of the volumes through our systems but fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period 
adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is another non gaap financial measure that is used by us 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash income or loss related to derivative instruments 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
the economic substance behind our use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make distributions to our investors 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net cash provided by operating activities and net income 
our non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net cash provided by operating activities and gaap net income 
adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and others to compare basic cash flows generated by us prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the board of directors of our general partner to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this metric  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
distributable cash flow is also an important non gaap financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and limited liability companies because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit s yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder 
the economic substance behind our use of distributable cash flow is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash flow sufficient to make distributions to our investors 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income 
our non gaap measure of distributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income 
distributable cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
our primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenues include sales of natural gas  ngls and condensate  and natural gas processing  from which we generate revenues through the compression  gathering  treating and processing of natural gas 
we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists  if applicable  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for processing services  we receive either fees or a percentage of commodities as payment for these services  depending on the type of contract 
under percent of proceeds contracts  we receive either an agreed upon percentage of the actual proceeds that we receive from our sales of the residue natural gas and ngls or an agreed upon percentage based on index related prices for the natural gas and ngls 
percent of value and percent of liquids contracts are variations on this arrangement 
under keep whole contracts  we keep the ngls extracted and return the processed natural gas or value of the natural gas to the producer 
natural gas or ngls that we receive for services or purchases for resale are in turn sold and recognized in accordance with the criteria outlined above 
under fee based contracts  we receive a fee based on throughput volumes 
we generally report revenues gross in the consolidated statements of operations 
except for fee based contracts  we act as the principal in the transactions where we receive commodities  take title to the natural gas and ngl and incur the risks and rewards of ownership 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
estimates and judgments are based on information available at the time such estimates and judgments are made 
adjustments made with respect to the use of these estimates and judgments often relate to information not previously available 
uncertainties with respect to such estimates and judgments are inherent in the preparation of financial statements 
estimates and judgments are used in  among other things  estimating unbilled revenues and operating and general and administrative costs developing fair value assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates  analyzing tangible and intangible assets for possible impairment  estimating the useful lives of assets and determining amounts to accrue for contingencies  guarantees and indemnifications 
actual results could differ materially from estimated amounts 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated service lives of our functional asset groups are as follows asset group range of years gas gathering systems and processing systems to other property and equipment to 
table of contents expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
expenditures to refurbish assets that extend the useful lives or prevent environmental contamination are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
upon disposition or retirement of property  plant and equipment  any gain or loss is charged to operations 
our determination of the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions  including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by our assets  normal wear and tear of the facilities the extent and frequency of maintenance programs 
from time to time  we utilize consultants and other experts to assist us in assessing the remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins we serve 
we may capitalize certain costs directly related to the construction of assets  including internal labor costs  interest and engineering costs 
upon disposition or retirement of property  plant and equipment  any gain or loss is charged to operations 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment when events or circumstances such as economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors indicate we may not recover the carrying amount of the assets 
we continually monitor our businesses and the market and business environments to identify indicators that may suggest an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate an asset for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset with the asset s expected future undiscounted cash flows 
these cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing  demand  competition  operating cost and other factors 
we recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable 
the determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding the probability of a range of outcomes and the rates of interest used in the present value calculations 
any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of recoverability of our property  plant and equipment and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
price risk management hedging 
all derivative instruments not qualifying for the normal purchases and normal sales exception are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if a derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting and is designated as a hedge  the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income oci  a component of partners capital and reclassified to earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs 
cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as a hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the contract and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a hedge instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in oci related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain deferred until the forecasted transaction occurs 
if it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are reclassified to earnings immediately 
our policy is to formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and the manner in which the hedging instrument s effectiveness will be assessed 
at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
hedge effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis 
any ineffective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified to earnings in the current period 

table of contents estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets are used to compute depreciation expense  future asset retirement obligations and in impairment testing 
estimated useful lives are based  among other things  on the assumption that we provide an appropriate level of maintenance capital expenditures while the assets are still in operation 
without these continued capital expenditures  the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly 
estimated lives could be impacted by such factors as future energy prices  environmental regulations  various legal factors and competition 
if the useful lives of these assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation expense may increase  liabilities for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in carrying values of tangible and intangible assets may result 
accounting pronouncements recently adopted in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the fasb partially deferred the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
we adopted sfas with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are recognized on a recurring basis on january  although the adoption of sfas did not materially impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow  we are now required to provide additional disclosures as part of our financial statements 
sfas establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
for further discussion and disclosure of sfas requirements  see note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
our adoption of sfas on january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas  derivative instruments and hedging activities and its related interpretations and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  early adoption is encouraged 
our adoption of sfas as of december  did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the additional disclosures required by sfas are included in note to consolidated financial statements  which begins on page f accounting pronouncements recently issued in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  application of the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  to master limited partnerships 
eitf improves the comparability of earnings per unit calculations for master limited partnerships mlps with incentive distribution rights idrs in accordance with statement and its related interpretations 
under eitf  when an mlp s current period earnings are in excess of cash distributions and the idrs are a separate limited partner interest  undistributed earnings should be allocated to the general partner gp  limited partners lps and idr holder utilizing the contractual terms of the partnership agreement 
the distribution formula for available cash specified in the partnership agreement contractually mandates the way in which earnings are distributed 

table of contents additionally  eitf requires an mlp to reflect its contractual obligation to make distributions as of the end of the current reporting period 
therefore  an mlp would reduce increase income loss from continuing operations or net income or loss for the current reporting period by the amount of available cash that has been or will be distributed to the gp  lps and idr holder for that current reporting period 
if distributions to the idr holder are contractually limited to available cash as defined in the partnership agreement  then the specified threshold for the current reporting period would be the holder s share of available cash that has been or will be distributed to the idr holder for that current reporting period 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is not permitted 
our adoption of eitf will not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are currently evaluating the effect this pronouncement will have on our present computation of earnings per unit

see liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations 
liquidity and capital resources our ability to finance our operations  including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions  to meet our indebtedness obligations  to refinance our indebtedness  to meet our collateral requirements  or to pay our distributions depends on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including commodity prices  particularly for natural gas and ngls  operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures 
see item a 
risk factors 
our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations  a credit facility with both uncommitted and committed availability and access to both the debt and equity capital markets 
the credit markets are undergoing significant volatility 
many financial institutions have liquidity concerns  prompting government intervention to mitigate pressure on the credit markets 
our exposure to the current credit crisis includes our credit facility  cash investments and counterparty performance risks 
continued volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets 
in order to increase our cash position in the face of the credit and capital market disruptions  on october   we requested a million funding under our credit facility 
lehman bank  a lender under our credit facility  defaulted on its portion of this borrowing request resulting in actual funding of million 
as a result of the default by lehman bank  we believe the availability under our credit facility has been effectively reduced by approximately million 
current market conditions also elevate the concern over counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit 
we have all of our commodity derivatives with major financial institutions 
should any of these financial counterparties not perform  we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
we sell a significant portion of our natural gas  ngls and condensate to targa and a variety of other purchasers 
non performance by a trade creditor could result in losses 
crude oil and natural gas prices are also volatile and have declined significantly during the later half of in a continuing effort to reduce the volatility of our cash flows  we have periodically entered into commodity contracts for a portion of our estimated equity volumes through see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
the current market conditions may also impact our ability to enter into future commodity derivative contracts 
in the event of a global recession  commodity prices may stay depressed or fall further thereby causing a prolonged downturn  which could reduce our operating margins and cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had liquidity of million  including million of cash and million of additional borrowing capacity available under our credit facility 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity and conditions in the capital markets 
additionally  we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of the other twenty three lenders under our credit facility 
to date  other than the lehman bank default  we have experienced no disruptions in our ability to access funds committed under our credit facility 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruptions in the credit environment 
see item a 
risk factors in this annual report 
historically  our cash generated from operations has been sufficient to finance our operating expenditures and fund most of our maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  with remaining amounts being distributed to targa during its period of ownership and to our unitholders since our ipo 

table of contents we believe that cash generated from operations along with availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements and our minimum quarterly cash distributions for at least the next year 
we intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner in an amount at least equal to the minimum quarterly distribution rate of per common unit per quarter per common unit on an annualized basis 
due to our cash distribution policy  we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations 
as a result  we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources  including other debt and common unit issuances  to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures 
historically  we have relied on internally generated cash flows for these purposes 
see factors that significantly affect our results distributions to our unitholders for a table that shows the distributions we declared subsequent to the fourth quarter of and distributions declared and paid in and working capital 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
our working capital requirements are primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
these changes are impacted by changes in the prices of commodities that we buy and sell 
in general  our working capital requirements increase in periods of rising commodity prices and decrease in periods of declining commodity prices 
however  our working capital needs do not necessarily change at the same rate as commodity prices because both accounts receivable and accounts payable are impacted by the same commodity prices 
in addition  the timing of payments received by our customers or paid to our suppliers can also cause fluctuations in working capital because we settle with most of our larger suppliers and customers on a monthly basis and often near the end of the month 
we expect that our future working capital requirements will be impacted by these same factors 
prior to our ipo and the contribution of the north texas system in february and the acquisition of the saou and lou systems in october  all intercompany transactions  including commodity sales and expense reimbursements  were not cash settled with targa  but were recorded as an adjustment to parent equity on the balance sheet 
the primary transactions between targa and us are natural gas and ngl sales  the provision of operations and maintenance activities and the provision of general and administrative services 
as a result of this accounting treatment  our working capital did not reflect any affiliate accounts receivable for intercompany commodity sales or any affiliate accounts payable for the personnel and services provided by or paid for by our parent prior to the acquisition of the north texas system and the subsequent acquisition of the saou and lou systems 
as of december   we had a positive working capital balance of million 
cash flow 
net cash provided by or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for  and were as follows year ended december  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for decreased by million or compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in working capital balances and an million payment to terminate certain out of the money commodity derivatives  partially offset by a million increase in net income 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million or  for compared to this increase is attributable to an increase in our net income  increased non cash charges and increases in working capital balances 

table of contents investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for increased million or compared to the increase is primarily from increased expenditures related to gathering system expansion projects begun in the third quarter of net cash used in investing activities for increased million or  compared to  primarily due to the completion of gathering system expansion projects and higher major maintenance expenditures 
the increase of million in expansion projects and major maintenance expenditures resulted from the increased size of our gathering systems and the effect of higher utilization of our field compression facilities 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for decreased by million  or compared to cash flows from financing activities during included activity related to our ipo and our acquisition from targa of the saou and lou systems 
during  net borrowings of million were offset by a million payment to repurchase approximately million of our senior notes and a million increase in distributions to our unitholders 
the net cash used in financing activities for increased by million compared to this increase primarily reflects the proceeds from our equity offerings  borrowings under our credit facility and deemed parent contributions prior to the contribution or transfer of assets to us  partially offset by payments of debt  offering costs  debt issuance costs related to our credit facility  distributions to our equity holders and payments to targa for assets transferred under common control 
capital requirements 
the midstream energy business can be capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations 
a significant portion of the cost of constructing new gathering lines to connect to our gathering system is generally paid for by the natural gas producer 
however  we expect to incur significant expenditures throughout related to the expansion of our natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either i maintenance expenditures or ii expansion expenditures 
maintenance expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets including the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life  the addition of new sources of natural gas supply to our systems to replace natural gas production declines and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
expansion expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  add capabilities  reduce costs or enhance revenues 
year ended december  in millions capital expenditures expansion maintenance we estimate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in  of which approximately million will be for maintenance 
given our objective of growth through acquisitions  expansions of existing assets and other internal growth projects  we anticipate that over time we will invest significant amounts of capital to grow and acquire assets 
expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly based on investment opportunities 
description of senior notes 
on june   we entered into a purchase agreement to issue and sell  in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes due the notes 
on june   in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into an indenture the indenture governing the terms of the notes 
the notes will mature on july  and interest is payable on the notes semi annually in arrears on each january and july the notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries 

table of contents the indenture restricts our ability to make distributions to unitholders if we are in default or an event of default as defined in the indenture exists 
it also restricts our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to i incur additional debt or enter into sale and leaseback transactions  ii pay certain distributions on or repurchase  equity interests only if such distributions do not meet specified conditions  iii make certain investments  iv incur liens  v enter into transactions with affiliates  vi merge or consolidate with another company  and vii transfer and sell assets 
these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications 
if at any time when the notes are rated investment grade by both moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s ratings services and no default as defined in the indenture has occurred and is continuing  many of such covenants will terminate and we and our subsidiaries will cease to be subject to such covenants

following is a summary of our contractual cash obligations over the next several fiscal years  as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions debt obligations interest on debt obligations capacity payments right of way asset retirement obligation represents million outstanding on the senior notes due july  and million outstanding under our million senior secured credit facility 
as of december   we had availability under our credit facility of million  after giving effect to outstanding borrowings of million  million of issued letters of credit and the lehman bank default of approximately million 
represents interest expense on our debt  based on interest rates as of december  consists of payments for firm natural gas pipeline capacity 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are our exposure to changes in commodity prices  particularly to the prices of natural gas and ngls  changes in interest rates  as well as nonperformance by our customers 
we do not use risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
commodity price risk 
a majority of our revenues are derived from percent of proceeds contracts under which we receive a portion of the natural gas and or ngls or equity volumes  as payment for services 
the prices of natural gas and ngls are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
we monitor these risks and enter into hedging transactions designed to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our business 
cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged 
the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in our operating cash flow despite fluctuations in commodity prices 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  as of december   we have hedged the commodity price associated with a significant portion of our expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes for the years through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
the percentages of our expected equity volumes that are hedged decrease over time 
with swaps  we typically receive an agreed fixed price for a specified notional quantity of natural gas or ngl and we pay the hedge counterparty a floating price for that same quantity based upon published index prices 
since we receive from our customers substantially the same floating index price from the sale of the underlying physical commodity  these transactions are designed to effectively lock in the agreed fixed price in advance for the volumes hedged 
in order to avoid having a greater volume hedged than our actual equity volumes  we typically limit our use of swaps to hedge the prices of less than our expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes 
we utilize purchased puts or floors to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk 
we intend to continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into similar hedge transactions using swaps  collars  purchased puts or floors or other hedge instruments as market conditions permit 
we have tailored our hedges to generally match the ngl product composition and the ngl and natural gas delivery points to those of our physical equity volumes 
our ngl hedges cover baskets of ethane  propane  normal butane  iso butane and natural gasoline based upon our expected equity ngl composition 
we believe this strategy avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as proxy hedges of ngl prices 
additionally  our ngl hedges are based on published index prices for delivery at mont belvieu and our natural gas hedges are based on published index prices for delivery at waha and mid continent  which closely approximate our actual ngl and natural gas delivery points 
we hedge a portion of our condensate sales using crude oil hedges that are based on the nymex futures contracts for west texas intermediate light  sweet crude 
our commodity price hedging transactions are typically documented pursuant to a standard international swap dealers association isda form with customized credit and legal terms 
our principal counterparties or  if applicable  their guarantors have investment grade credit ratings 
our payment obligations in connection with substantially all of these hedging transactions and any additional credit exposure due to a rise in natural gas and ngl prices relative to the fixed prices set forth in the hedges  are secured by a first priority lien in the collateral securing our senior secured indebtedness that ranks equal in right of payment with liens granted in favor of our senior secured lenders 
as long as this first priority lien is in effect  we expect to have no obligation to post cash  letters of credit or other additional collateral to secure these hedges at any time even if our counterparty s exposure to our credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices or because there has been a change in our creditworthiness 
a purchased put or floor transaction does not create credit exposure to us for our counterparties 
during  and  we entered into hedging arrangements for a portion of our forecasted equity volumes 
floor volumes and floor pricing are based solely on purchased puts or floors 
during  and  our operating revenues were adjusted by net hedge losses of million  million and million 

table of contents as of december   our commodity hedges were as follows natural gas avg

our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
if prices rise above the prices at which we have hedged  we will receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our variable rate debt under our credit facility 
to the extent that interest rates increase  our interest expense for our revolving debt will also increase 
as of december   there were borrowings of approximately million outstanding under our million credit facility 
as of december  we had the following open interest rate swaps notional amount expiration date fixed rate amount fair value in thousands january  million january  million we have designated all interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses relating to the interest rate swaps are recorded in oci until the interest expense on the related debt is recognized in earnings 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in the underlying interest rate  after taking into account our interest rate swaps  would increase our annual interest expense by million 
credit risk 
we are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers 
we operate under the targa credit policy and closely monitor the creditworthiness of customers to whom we grant credit and establish credit limits in accordance with this credit policy 
in addition to third party contracts  we have entered into several agreements with targa 
for example  we are party to natural gas  ngl and condensate purchase agreements pursuant to which targa purchases the majority of our natural gas  ngls and high pressure condensate 
in addition  we are also a party to an omnibus agreement with targa which addresses  among other things  the provision of general and administrative and operating services to us 
any material nonperformance under the omnibus and purchase agreements by targa could materially and adversely impact our ability to operate and make distributions to our unitholders 
as of december   affiliates of goldman sachs  merrill lynch and barclays bank accounted for  and of our counterparty credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments 
goldman sachs  merrill lynch and barclays bank are major financial institutions  each possessing investment grade credit ratings  based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by standard poor s ratings services  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc
