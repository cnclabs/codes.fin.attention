table of contents part i item business we are a leading us producer of zinc and zinc based products with production and or recycling operations at six facilities in five states 
we also own and operate on our premises a megawatt coal fired power plant that provides us with a cost competitive source of electricity and allows us to sell approximately one fifth of its capacity 
our products are used in a wide variety of applications  including in the galvanizing of fabricated steel products and as components in rubber tires  alkaline batteries  paint  chemicals and pharmaceuticals 
we believe that we are the largest refiner of zinc oxide and prime western pw zinc metal  a grade of zinc containing a minimum of zinc  in north america 
we believe we are also the largest north american recycler of electric arc furnace eaf dust  a hazardous waste produced by the steel mini mill manufacturing process 
we  together with our predecessors  have been operating in the zinc industry for more than years 
we believe we operate as a single business segment 
while we vary our raw material inputs  or feedstocks  based on cost and availability  we generally produce our zinc products using recycled zinc  including zinc recovered from our four eaf dust recycling operations located in four states 
we believe that our ability to convert recycled zinc into finished products results in lower feed costs than for smelters that rely primarily on zinc concentrates 
our four eaf dust recycling facilities also generate service fee revenue from steel mini mills by providing a convenient and safe means for recycling their eaf dust 
during  we sold approximately million pounds of zinc products  generally priced at amounts based on premiums to zinc prices on the london metals exchange lme 
for the year ended december   we generated sales and net income of million and million  respectively 
competitive strengths leading market positions and strategically located recycling facilities we believe that we are the largest refiner of zinc oxide and pw zinc metal in north america  based on volume 
we also believe that we are the largest north american recycler of eaf dust and that we currently recycle more than half of all eaf dust generated in the united states 
in addition  our four company owned eaf dust recycling facilities are strategically located near major eaf operators  reducing transportation costs and enhancing our ability to compete effectively with other means of eaf dust disposal 
we believe that the location of our facilities  together with our competitive cost position  extensive zinc distribution network and proprietary market knowledge  will enable us to maintain our leading market positions and continue to capture market share in zinc products and zinc recycling 
strong relationships with diverse customer base we believe that our product quality  reputation for on time delivery and competitive pricing enable us to maintain strong relationships with a broad base of customers in each of our end markets 
for example  we are the leading supplier of zinc metal to the after fabrication hot dip segment of the north american galvanizing industry 
we also sell zinc oxide to over producers of tire and rubber products  chemicals  paints  plastics and pharmaceuticals 
we have supplied zinc oxide to nine of our current ten largest zinc oxide customers for over ten years  and we believe that we are the sole or primary supplier of zinc to most of our customers 
in addition  the us environmental protection agency epa has designated our recycling process as a best demonstrated available technology in the area of high temperature metals recovery related to the processing of eaf dust 
we are the largest recycler of eaf dust in the us  and we now recycle eaf dust for seven of north america s ten largest eaf operators based on production volume 
we are working to expand our recycling capacity further in order to better service these and other customers 
low cost feedstock sources we believe that we are the only zinc smelter in north america with the proven ability to refine zinc metal and zinc oxide using recycled zinc feedstocks 
our use of large amounts of recycled feedstock reduces our 
table of contents exposure to increases in lme zinc prices and increases our operating margins during periods of high lme zinc prices 
in addition  our eaf dust recycling operations provide us with a reliable  cost effective source of recycled zinc without relying on third party sellers 
proven  proprietary technology with flexible processes since our recycling process converts eaf dust into saleable products  our customers generally face less exposure to environmental liabilities from eaf dust  which the epa classifies as a listed hazardous waste  than if they disposed of their eaf dust in landfills 
in addition  we believe our zinc smelter and refinery in monaca  pennsylvania is unique in its ability to refine zinc using almost any form of zinc bearing feedstock 
this flexibility allows us to modify our feedstock mix based on cost and availability  as well as to use recycled zinc feedstock  whether purchased from third parties at a discount to the lme zinc price or generated by our eaf dust recycling operations 
strong  experienced management team our seven member senior management team collectively has over years of experience in zinc and metal related industries 
james m 
hensler  our chief executive officer  joined us in early and has since established a culture of continuous improvement in safety and operational excellence  which has led to significant cost reductions and productivity improvements 
business strategy continue to focus on production efficiencies and operating cost reductions we have reduced our manufacturing costs by increasing our usage of low cost feedstock  streamlining our organizational structure and implementing six sigma a business process improvement methodology initiatives  and we intend to continue to focus on these and similar initiatives in the future 
as part of our six sigma initiatives  we made a series of operating improvements at certain facilities 
for example  at our calumet plant we have reduced the amount of non zinc materials fed to our smelter  thereby reducing operating costs by approximately million on an annual basis without significant capital expenditures 
at our monaca facility we implemented the use of larger coke in our furnaces in resulting in savings in excess of million 
we also improved the performance of the monaca facility s furnace preheaters by increasing the preheat temperature of the charge to our electrothermic furnaces resulting in savings in excess of million in in  we converted our power plant to the burning of powder river basin coal prb coal  avoiding an increase in operating costs of approximately million per year with a one time investment of approximately million 
we have recently entered into a prb coal supply agreement through finally  in response to a recent significant decrease in demand for zinc metals resulting from the current economic downturn  we have taken aggressive steps to reduce our operating costs  including the temporary idling of our smallest  highest cost recycling facility in beaumont  texas  reductions in the price paid for purchased feedstock as a percentage of the lme price  a reduction of our salaried and temporary workforce and a cost saving revision to our construction strategy for our new south carolina facility 
please see our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a further discussion of the economic downturn and the accompanying decrease in demand 
expand eaf dust recycling capacity we believe that there are significant opportunities for us to recycle more eaf dust 
we estimate that in approximately one third of the eaf dust generated per year was deposited in landfills in the united states  including by existing customers 
in addition  several new eaf steel plant projects are either under construction or were recently announced  further increasing eaf dust generation in the united states 
due to productivity  capital and operating cost efficiencies relative to integrated steel mills  the mini mill share of the us steel market has doubled in the last ten years and is expected to account for over of us steel produced by  according to the steel manufacturers association 
we believe that steel mini mill operators increasingly will rely on recyclers rather than landfills to manage this increased output 
in order to meet this expected growth  we placed a new kiln with an annual eaf dust recycling capacity of  tons into production in early january we are also 
table of contents building an additional kiln facility that would further increase our recycling capacity near one of our current customer s facilities  a major us steel mini mill producer 
in addition to generating additional service fees  we expect that our new kilns will provide us with additional low cost recycled zinc that we can use in our own smelting process or that we can sell as feed to other zinc smelters 
the completion date of the project could be as early as the first quarter of but may be influenced by market prevailing conditions 
expand production capacity for existing zinc products we expect to increase our levels of zinc smelter production output on an annual basis from approximately  tons in to  tons 
for the period from the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of we made progress toward that goal as we increased our production output to an annual rate of approximately  tons 
we deferred our efforts to further increase production output as market conditions began to deteriorate in the fourth quarter of but expect to resume those efforts as market conditions improve 
we also expanded our capacity to produce zinc oxide by converting existing refining capacity at our monaca facility 
our additional production capacity allowed us to increase our service to the zinc oxide market 
continue to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations we sourced approximately of our zinc feedstock in from our eaf dust recycling operations  which feedstock is not impacted by changes in lme zinc prices 
we will continue to evaluate our zinc price hedging alternatives considering the costs and benefits in light of the commodity price environment  hedging transaction costs and the extent to which we are able to increase the percentage of zinc we acquire from our recycling operations 
we hedged approximately of our expected production of zinc in and through the purchase of put options whereby we would receive a minimum price per pound for the quantity hedged 
we paid a total of million for the options and received million in cash as the options settled 
in october  we sold the put options for million resulting in a million gain 
we replaced the options with similar options having a strike price of per pound for a cost of million 
the remainder of our zinc feedstock costs are derived primarily from zinc secondaries which use lme based pricing  and therefore are somewhat naturally hedged against changes in the lme price 
we have also entered into forward contracts for the purchase of coal for a fixed price through we believe that locking in a price for coal  which comprised approximately of our energy costs in  will stabilize our production costs and reduce the risk of coal supply interruptions 
pursue new markets  applications and acquisition opportunities we intend to continue to leverage our technical expertise  culture of innovation and close customer relationships in order to identify and pursue new markets and applications for our products 
for example  we are currently testing new  higher margin applications for iron rich material  a co product of eaf dust recycling  such as its potential uses as a low cost feed for iron and steel production  its use as a passive water treatment medium at coal mining sites that have acidic mine drainage and as a daily cover or base material for municipal landfills to reduce ground water contamination 
we are also evaluating new markets for our zinc powder  and we expect that our expanded eaf dust recycling capacity will allow us to enter new markets for the sale of crude zinc oxide czo to other zinc smelters in the us and internationally 
we also intend to continue to identify and explore strategic acquisition opportunities 
our history we  together with the previous owners of our assets  have been operating in the zinc industry for more than years 
horsehead industries  inc hii was formed as a result of several purchases of assets and entities that substantially form our existing company 
in  record low zinc prices  production inefficiencies  high operational costs and legacy environmental costs associated with prior owners operators of our facilities caused hii to file for chapter bankruptcy protection 
an affiliate of sun capital partners  inc together with its affiliates  sun capital purchased substantially all of the operating assets and assumed limited liabilities of hii in december pursuant to a sale order under section of the us bankruptcy code 
sun capital assisted us in hiring our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer in  and since that time we have implemented significant 
table of contents operational improvements as well as experienced significantly improved industry conditions 
in addition  since we have performed maintenance at our production facilities that was deferred by our predecessor due to its financial difficulties 
we expect to continue to perform additional maintenance at these facilities for the foreseeable future 
as a result of certain transactions in  sun capital and its affiliates no longer own any of our outstanding common stock 
on november   we completed the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
on april   we completed the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we used the net proceeds of the offerings primarily to repurchase shares and redeem warrants held by our pre november stockholders including sun capital 
on august   we completed the public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share less discounts and commissions of as part of an underwritten public offering 
we used a portion of the net proceeds to retire substantially all debt and used the remaining net proceeds of the public offering to fund capital expansion and improvements and for general corporate purposes 
on august   the sec declared effective a registration statement that registered for resale up to  shares of our common stock issued in our and private placements 
operations our recycling facilities recycle eaf dust into czo  and zinc calcine  which we then use as raw material feedstocks in the production of zinc metal and value added zinc products 
our recycling and production operations form a complete zinc recycling loop  from recycled zinc to finished zinc products 
we are the only zinc producer in the us that uses recycled materials for substantially all of its zinc feedstocks 
recycling we operate four hazardous waste recycling facilities for the recovery of zinc from eaf dust and are building a fifth 
our recycling process has been designated by the epa as a best demonstrated available technology for the processing of eaf dust 
our recycling facilities are strategically located near sources of eaf dust production 
these facilities recover zinc from eaf dust generated primarily by steel mini mill manufacturers during the melting of steel scrap  as well as from other waste material 
we extract zinc from eaf dust  and recycle the other components of eaf dust into non hazardous materials  using our proprietary waelz kiln process at our palmerton  rockwood  and calumet facilities  and our flame reactor technology at our beaumont facility 
our waelz kiln recycling process blends  conditions and adds carbon to eaf dust  feeding it then into the kiln itself  a refractory lined tube that is approximately feet in length and feet in diameter 
during the passage through the kiln  the material is heated under reducing conditions at temperatures exceeding  degrees celsius  thereby volatilizing the nonferrous metals  including zinc 
the resulting volatized gas stream is oxidized and collected as czo  which has a zinc content of between and 
our flame reactor recycling process heats feedstock to a temperature high enough approximately  degrees celsius to convert nonferrous metals into 
table of contents czo 
in addition  both processes produce iron rich material that we sell for use as an aggregate in asphalt and as an iron source in cement 
the majority of the czo generated by both processes is shipped to our palmerton facility  where it is further refined in a process  called calcining  whereby we heat the material to drive off impurities 
through this rotary kiln process  which is fired with natural gas  the zinc content is further upgraded to approximately and collected as zinc calcine in granular form for shipment to our monaca facility or sale to other zinc refineries around the world 
the metal concentrate product from the calcining process is shipped for final metals recovery to our state of the art hydrometallurgical processing facility in bartlesville 
we have added technology at our smelting facility to allow us to ship an increasing amount of czo directly as a feed to our monaca  pennsylvania  facility 
in order to expand our eaf dust recycling capacity  we brought an  ton per year kiln online at our rockwood  tennessee facility in january at a cost of approximately million 
this new kiln provides approximately  tons of additional zinc that we use either directly in our own smelting process or sell as feed to other zinc smelters 
we are currently building a new kiln facility with capacity of approximately  tons per year in south carolina that could be completed as early as the first quarter of or as market conditions improve 
production our  tons per year capacity electrothermic zinc smelter and refinery in monaca produces zinc metal and value added zinc products eg  zinc oxide using a wide range of feedstocks  including zinc generated by our recycling operations  zinc secondary material from galvanizers and other users of zinc 
this uniquely flexible electrothermic smelter and refinery in monaca provides a substantial competitive advantage both in raw material costs where it is able to use a wide range of zinc bearing feedstocks and in finished products where  together with our refining operations  it can produce a wide range of zinc metal and value added zinc products 
our monaca smelter is the only smelter in north america that is able to use this wide range of feedstocks  including recycled feedstocks  to produce our zinc products 
our unique ability to vary our feedstock blend lowers our overall raw materials costs without corresponding reductions in product quality  as compared to other zinc smelters and refiners  which generally can accept only a narrow slate of specific mined zinc concentrates  together with only small amounts of recycled materials 
we also own and operate at our monaca facility a megawatt coal fired power plant that provides us with a cost competitive source of electricity and allows us to sell approximately one fifth of its capacity 
the monaca facility operates on a hours per day  days per year basis to maximize efficiency and output 
eaf sourced calcine and other purchased secondary zinc materials are processed through a sintering operation which is a method for making solid material from particles by heating the particles to below their melting point until they adhere to each other 
the sintering process converts this combined zinc feedstock into a uniform  hard  porous material suitable for the electrothermic furnaces 
monaca s seven electrothermic furnaces are the key to monaca s production flexibility 
sintered feedstock and metallic zinc secondary materials are mixed with metallurgical coke and fed directly into the top of the furnaces 
metallic zinc vapor is drawn from the furnaces into a vacuum condenser  which is then tapped to produce molten zinc metal 
this metal is then either cast as slab zinc metal  or conveyed directly to the zinc refinery in liquid form 
this integrated facility reduces costs by eliminating the need to cast and then remelt the zinc to refinery feed 
at the refinery  the molten zinc is directly fed through distillation columns to produce an ultra high purity zinc vapor that is condensed into thermally refined sshg zinc metal or processed through a combustion chamber into zinc oxide 
the condensed metal is either sold or sent for further conversion into zinc powder 
we believe that our thermally produced sshg zinc metal is among the purest and highest quality sshg zinc metal sold in north america 
our zinc oxide is processed and separately refined through the largest north american  and highly automated  zinc oxide screening  coating and packing facility to create one of our grades of zinc oxide with iso certification 
our product development lab  located at the monaca site  is designed for production of specially engineered zinc oxide products for unique  high tech applications 
one such product is an extremely fine particle size micronized zinc oxide that may be used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications 

table of contents the flow of operations chart below describes our operations  beginning with the input of raw materials  continuing through the production processes and identifying finished products and end uses for each such raw material 
flow chart products and services we offer a wide variety of zinc products and services 
in  we sold approximately  tons of zinc products 
the following are our primary zinc products zinc metal our primary zinc metal product is pw zinc metal  which we sell to the hot dip galvanizing and brass industries 
we also produce sshg zinc metal  which is used as feed for the manufacture of high purity zinc powder and zinc alloys 
sshg zinc metal is an ultra pure grade of zinc exceeding the american society for testing and materials standard for special high grade zinc 
our zinc metal is recognized within the galvanizing industry for its consistent quality and appearance 
we are the leading supplier of zinc metal to the after fabrication hot dip segment of the north american galvanizing industry approximately customers  who use our zinc metal to provide a protective coating to a myriad of fabricated products  from pipe and guard rails to  heat exchangers and telecommunications towers 
we also sell pw zinc metal for use in the production of brass  a zinc copper alloy 
we believe that our operational standards and proximity to customers allow us to deliver higher quality metal than many of our competitors  as lengthy transit times and poor skimming techniques can often result in surface oxidation 
to accommodate various customer handling needs  our zinc metal is sold in numerous forms  from pound slabs to  pound ingots 
zinc oxide we sell over different grades of zinc oxide with differing particle sizes  shapes  coatings and purity levels 
zinc oxide is an important ingredient in the production of tire and rubber products  chemicals  ceramics  plastics  paints  lubricating oils and pharmaceuticals 
the various end uses for zinc oxide are tire and rubber applications zinc oxide aids in the vulcanization process  acts as a strengthening and reinforcing agent  provides uv protection  and enhances thermal and electrical properties 
there is approximately a half pound of zinc oxide in a typical automobile tire 

table of contents chemical applications in motor oil  zinc oxide is used to reduce oxidation  inhibit corrosion and extend the wear of automotive engines 
in plastics  zinc oxide is an effective uv stabilizer for polypropylene and polyethylene 
ceramics ceramics containing zinc oxide are used in electronic components 
for example  in ceramic varistors surge protectors  zinc oxide allows for high temperature stability  resistance to electrical load  current shock and humidity 
other applications in paints  zinc oxide provides mold and mildew protection  functions as a white pigment and provides uv protection and chalking resistance 
in pharmaceutical applications  zinc oxide operates as a sunscreen  a vitamin supplement and a medicinal ointment 
eaf dust recycling we created the market for eaf dust recycling with the development of our recycling technology in the early s  which has since been designated by the epa as the best demonstrated available technology for processing of eaf dust  a hazardous waste generated by steel mini mills 
to date  we have recycled over million tons of eaf dust equivalent to million tons of zinc  representing the dust generated in the production of over million tons of steel 
since eaf dust is sold or converted into saleable products  the steel mini mills exposure to environmental liabilities related to eaf dust is reduced 
in the first nine months of  we recycled eaf dust at an annual rate of approximately  tons 
the softening market conditions in the fourth quarter resulted in our actual eaf dust recycling for to be approximately  tons 
the installation of a new waelz kiln in rockwood in early january increased our recycling capacity by  net tons  or 
we currently are constructing a new kiln facility in south carolina  adding additional eaf dust processing capacity that could be brought online as early as the first quarter or later as market conditions warrant 
czo sales given the strong demand for zinc bearing feed materials and attractive pricing  we began selling czo generated in our waelz kilns to other zinc smelters in we plan to expand sales of this product during periods of generation in excess of our smelter requirements 
zinc powder and copper based powders our zinc powder is sold for use in a variety of chemical  metallurgical and battery applications as well as for use in corrosion resistant coating applications 
zinc powder is manufactured by the atomization of molten zinc  and is coarser than zinc dust 
we manufacture three basic lines of powders special zinc powders these are used in general chemical and metallurgical applications and in friction applications such as brake linings for automobiles 
battery grade zinc powders these are used in most types of alkaline batteries as well as mercuric oxide  silver oxide and zinc air batteries 
copper based powders these include brass  bronze and nickel silver powders 
these products are used in a variety of applications including brazing  infiltrating and powdered metallurgical hardware such as lock bodies  valves and gears 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing staff consists of the following a sales and marketing group comprised of sales professionals whose goal is to develop and maintain excellent customer relationships and provide key market analysis  
table of contents a customer service department responsible for processing zinc orders  scheduling product shipments and answering customer inquiries  and a technical service staff highly trained to assist zinc customers with specification development  new applications  process improvements and on site troubleshooting assistance when needed 
our process engineering group provides additional technical help to our eaf clients with monthly eaf analytical information and assistance with any problems encountered on eaf dust chemistry  transportation and environmental matters 
in addition to our sales and marketing organization  our quality assurance department provides extensive laboratory services critical to maintaining in plant process control and to providing customer support by certifying compliance to hundreds of unique product specifications 
we are iso certified 
our laboratory also offers sales and technical services support by assisting in new product developments and troubleshooting various application and processing issues both in plant and with specific customers 
we also rely on a network of distributors with warehouses throughout north america who assist us with supporting smaller customers 
customers most of the zinc metal we produce is purchased by galvanizers and brass producers 
we are the leading supplier of zinc metal to the after fabrication hot dip segment of the north american galvanizing industry 
we sell zinc metal to a broad group of approximately hot dip galvanizers 
in many cases  these customers are also suppliers of secondary materials including zinc remnants of steel galvanizing processes to us 
we also sell a smaller portion of our metal product to brass manufacturers 
we sell zinc oxide to over different customers under contract as well as on a spot basis  principally to manufacturers of tire and rubber products  lubricating oils  chemicals  paints  ceramics  plastics and pharmaceuticals 
our sshg zinc metal product is used in the manufacturing of zinc powder for the alkaline battery industry 
we typically enter into multi year service contracts with steel mini mills to recycle their eaf dust 
we provide our eaf dust recycling services to over steel producing facilities 
raw material in  approximately of the raw material used in the monaca facility was sourced through our eaf dust recycling operations 
the remaining of the raw material was comprised of zinc secondaries  which are principally zinc containing remnants of steel galvanizing processes  including top drosses  bottom drosses and skimmings that we purchase primarily from several of our metal customers 
the prices of zinc secondaries vary according to the amount of recoverable zinc contained and provide us with a diverse portfolio of low cost inputs from which to choose 
in addition to the dross and skims from the galvanizing industry  we purchase other types of zinc bearing residues from the zinc  brass and alloying industries 
many of these materials are acquired from our own customers 
in addition  we also have long standing relationships with zinc scrap brokers in north america  europe and south america 
these brokers in some cases act as an agent for us and are favorably located to supply us with reliable and cost effective zinc scrap 
power plant and fuels we rely on a combination of purchased and internally generated electricity for our operations 
we generate substantially all of our electricity requirements for monaca at our on site power plant  using prb coal as our principal input 
sales of excess power capacity from this power plant have also historically provided a reliable source of revenue 
in addition to the electricity used by our monaca facility  we use a combination of coke and natural gas in our smelting and refining processes 
our recycling facilities use a combination of coke  electricity and natural gas 
in  we purchased the majority of our energy under supply contracts  although we also engage in spot purchases 
we purchase all of our coal requirements pursuant to a supply agreement that carries fixed prices through 
table of contents intellectual property we possess proprietary technical expertise and know how related to eaf dust recycling and zinc production  particularly zinc production using recycled feedstocks 
our proprietary know how includes production methods for zinc oxide and micro fine zinc oxides and widely varying customer specifications 
as a major supplier of zinc metal and other zinc based products to industrial and commercial markets  we emphasize developing intellectual property and protecting our rights in our processes 
however  the scope of protection afforded by intellectual property rights  including ours  is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual issues 
also  there can be no assurance that intellectual property rights will not be infringed or designed around by others 
in addition  we may not elect to pursue an infringer due to the high costs and uncertainties associated with litigation 
further  there can be no assurance that courts will ultimately hold issued intellectual property rights to be valid and enforceable 
competition we believe that we are a unique business  having no direct competitor that recycles similar secondary materials into zinc products in north america 
our primary competitors in the zinc oxide segment include us zinc corporation us zinc  a wholly owned subsidiary of votorantim metals  ltda  and considar metal marketing inc considar  a marketing and distribution joint venture between hudbay minerals inc and traxys  a trading company sold by umicore group and corus steel to a private investment firm in us zinc  located in the middle southern states of the us  is also a zinc recycler 
us zinc is our primary competitor but lacks our integrated processing and smelting capabilities 
considar s product is sourced through the canadian operations of hudson bay mining and smelting co 
approximately of the zinc metal consumed in the us is imported 
therefore  we enjoy a domestic freight and reliability advantage over foreign competitors with respect to us customers 
xstrata plc which acquired falconbridge in  teck cominco limited and penoles are the primary zinc metal producers in the north american market 
the vast majority of the metal produced by these companies is used by continuous galvanizers in the coating of steel sheet products 
in addition  these producers have mining and smelting operations while we only engage in smelting 
we primarily produce pw zinc metal for use by hot dip galvanizers 
we compete for eaf dust management contracts primarily with companies that dispose of eaf dust in landfills eg  envirosafe and american ecology as well as with a mexico based recycler zinc nacional 
we are the largest of only two proven domestic recyclers of eaf dust 
steel dust recycling  the other domestic recycler  commenced operations during the second quarter of we expect to see new entrants to once again explore opportunities in this area when zinc prices are attractive 
our proven reliability and customer service have helped us maintain long standing customer relationships 
many of our eaf dust customers have been under contract with us since our predecessor began recycling eaf dust in the s 
zincox resources plc recently acquired big river zinc corporation with the stated intention of producing zinc metal from recycled eaf dust sourced from the us envirosafe and turkey  with initial estimated smelting output from eaf dust of  tons in they announced the groundbreaking for their recycling plant in ohio in june  however  no construction activity was evident on that site at year end 
in addition  the heritage group has built an eaf dust processing facility in arkansas and is expected to begin operations in governmental regulation and environmental issues our facilities and operations are subject to various federal  state and local governmental laws and regulations with respect to the protection of the environment  including regulations relating to air and water quality  solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal 
these laws include the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or superfund  rcra  the clean air act  the clean water act  and their state equivalents 
we are also subject to various other laws and regulations  including those administered by the department of labor  the ferc  the surface transportation board  and the department of transportation 
we believe that we are in material compliance with the applicable laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations governing our ongoing operations and that we have obtained or timely applied for all material permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our business 

table of contents hii s process modifications resulted in operations fully utilizing recycled feedstocks 
the use of recycled zinc feedstocks preserves natural resources  precluding the need for mining and land reclamation  and thereby operating consistent with the principles of sustainable development 
our recycling services avoid the potential environmental impacts that are associated with the landfilling of hazardous wastes 
eaf dust itself is a hazardous waste created during melting of steel scrap in electric arc furnaces by the steel mini mill industry 
our recycling process has been designated by the epa as best demonstrated available technology for the recycling of eaf dust 
we operate a hydrometallurgical metals recovery facility in bartlesville  processing a metal concentrate produced at our palmerton calcining operation 
the concentrate is separated into metal bearing fractions at bartlesville and sold to smelters 
the recovered zinc from this operation is returned to monaca 
the cadmium containing fraction is landfilled as a hazardous waste 
brines containing chlorides  fluorides  sodium and potassium are disposed in a fully permitted on site underground injection system at bartlesville 
we hold rcra permits at our palmerton  rockwood and bartlesville locations 
we have irrevocable letters of credit in place to satisfy rcra financial assurance requirements with respect to closure and post closure care at our palmerton facility and similar state level requirements for the landfill at our monaca facility 
similar financial assurance mechanisms are not required with respect to our rockwood location 
bartlesville was formerly a primary zinc processing facility operated by us and our predecessor 
the former facilities were closed under a rcra agreement with the state of oklahoma  which was completed in those facilities are currently in post closure care 
financial assurance at bartlesville is met by the three parties responsible for post closure care meeting the financial assurance test in the oklahoma regulations 
our palmerton property is part of a cercla site that was added to the national priorities list in when the palmerton assets were purchased out of bankruptcy in december  we acquired only those assets  including real property  needed to support the ongoing recycling and powders businesses at that location  resulting in our holding approximately acres of the approximately  acres owned by hii 
the successor in interest to previous owners has contractually assumed responsibility for historic site contamination and associated remediation  and has indemnified us against any liabilities related to the property  including natural resource damage 
exceptions to this indemnity include our obligations under the consent decree described below  non superfund rcra obligations and environmental liabilities resulting from our ongoing operations 
we inherited certain of hii s environmental liabilities related to our palmerton operations related to a consent decree between hii  the epa and the padep 
our obligations pursuant to this consent decree include construction of a storage building for calcine kiln feed materials and the removal of lead concentrate from three buildings 
these obligations are currently being managed to the satisfaction of the regulatory agencies and are reserved for on our balance sheet 
approximately of the lead concentrate was removed from the facilities in and the remainder was removed in we have npdes permits at our palmerton  monaca and bartlesville locations 
we also may incur costs related to future compliance with mact air emission regulations relating to industrial boilers as well as future mact regulations relating to the non ferrous secondary metals production category

risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking information contained in this annual report on form k 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which we have made forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that we do not currently consider to be significant that may adversely affect our business  performance or financial condition in the future 
the metals industry is highly cyclical 
fluctuations in the availability of zinc metal and in levels of customer demand have historically been severe  and future changes and or fluctuations could cause us to experience lower sales volumes  which would negatively impact our profit margins 
the metals industry is highly cyclical 
the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product  but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions  levels of industry capacity and availability of usable raw materials 
the overall levels of demand for our zinc metal and zinc based products reflect fluctuations in levels of end user demand  which depend in large part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and regional economic conditions in our markets 
for example  many of the principal consumers of zinc metal and zinc related products operate in industries  such as transportation  construction or general manufacturing  that themselves are heavily dependent on general economic conditions  including the availability of affordable energy sources  employment levels  interest rates  consumer confidence and housing demand 
these cyclical shifts in our customers industries tend to result in significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for our products and services 
as a result  in periods of recession  such as the one we are currently experiencing  or low economic growth  metals companies  including ours  have generally tended to under perform compared to other industries 
we generally have high fixed costs  so changes in industry demand that impact our production volume also can significantly impact our profit margins and our overall financial condition 
economic downturns in the national and international economies or a prolonged recession in our principal industry segments have had a negative impact on our operations and on those of our predecessor both recently and in the past  and a continuation or further deterioration of current economic conditions could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
current or future credit and financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in several ways 
as widely reported  financial markets in the united states  europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months  including  among other things  extreme volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets may delay or prevent our customers from securing funding adequate to honor their existing contracts with us or to enter into new contracts to purchase our products and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products 
our customers may also seek to delay deliveries of our products under existing contracts  which may postpone our ability to recognize revenue on contracts in our order backlog 
our business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity  including the levels of purchasing and investment in general 
strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies may adversely affect our results or may adversely affect our domestic customers ability to export their product 
we may also face increased risk that the counterparty to a hedging transaction that we enter or have entered into may default on its obligation to pay or deliver under the forward contract 
our cash balance is concentrated in one major us bank and our cash equivalents are guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
if the guarantees are not satisfied on a timely basis our liquidity will be adversely affected 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries  and any resulting effects or changes  including those 
table of contents described above  may have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in the prices of zinc metal and zinc related products will have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we derive most of our revenue from the sale of zinc and zinc based products 
changes in the market price of zinc impact the selling prices of our products  and therefore our profitability is significantly affected by decreased zinc prices 
market prices of zinc are dependent upon supply and demand and a variety of factors over which we have little or no control  including us and world economic conditions  availability and relative pricing of metal substitutes  labor costs  energy prices  environmental laws and regulations  weather  and import and export restrictions 
declines in the price of zinc have had a negative impact on our operations both recently and in the past  and further or future declines could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
in  record low zinc prices  together with high operational and legacy environmental costs and inefficiencies  caused our predecessor  hii  to file for chapter bankruptcy protection 
market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our products  and the price for any one or more of our products may fall below our production costs  requiring us to either incur short term losses and or idle or permanently shut down production capacity 
market prices for zinc may decrease even further  and therefore our operating results may be significantly harmed 
some of our products and services are vulnerable to long term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials  which would significantly reduce our sales 
our zinc products compete with other materials in many of their applications 
for example  our zinc is used by steel fabricators in the hot dip galvanizing process  in which steel is coated with zinc in order to protect it from corrosion 
steel fabricators also can use paint  which we do not sell  for corrosion protection 
demand for our zinc as a galvanizing material may shift depending on how customers view the respective merits of hot dip galvanizing and paint 
in addition  some of our customers may reduce or eliminate their usage of pw grade zinc metal because it contains a small amount of lead  and may switch to other grades of zinc metal that we do not produce 
in addition  in periods of high zinc prices  consumers of zinc may have additional incentives to invest in the development of technologically viable substitutes for zinc and zinc based products 
similarly  customers may develop ways to manufacture their products by using less zinc based material than they do currently 
if one or more of our customers successfully identify alternative products that can be substituted for our zinc products  or find ways to reduce their zinc consumption  our sales to those and other customers would likely decline 
demand for our eaf dust recycling operations may decline to the extent that steel mini mill producers identify less expensive or more convenient alternatives for the disposal of their eaf dust or if the epa were to no longer classify eaf dust as a listed hazardous waste 
we may in the future face increased competition from other eaf dust recyclers  including new entrants in the eaf dust recycling market  or from landfills implementing more effective disposal techniques 
furthermore  our current recycling customers may seek to capitalize on the value of the eaf dust produced by their operations  and may seek to recycle their dust themselves  or reduce the price they pay to us for the dust they deliver to us 
any of these developments would have an adverse effect on our financial results 

table of contents we may be unable to compete effectively against manufacturers of zinc products in one or more of our markets  which would limit our market share and or reduce our sales and our operating profit margins 
we face intense competition from regional  national and global companies in each of the markets we serve  where we face also the potential for future entrants and competitors 
we compete on the basis of product quality  on time delivery performance and price  with price representing a more important factor for our larger customers and for sales of standard zinc products than for smaller customers and customers to whom we sell value added zinc based products 
our competitors include other independent zinc producers as well as vertically integrated zinc companies that mine and produce zinc 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  we estimate that our products comprised only approximately of total zinc consumption in the us in  and several of our competitors have greater market share than we do 
our competitors may also foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do  sell products at a lower cost than we can and or adapt more quickly to new technologies or industry and customer requirements 
we operate in a global marketplace  and zinc metal imports now represent approximately of us zinc metal consumption 
in the future  foreign zinc metal producers may develop new ways of packaging and transporting zinc metal that could mitigate the freight cost and other shipping limitations that we believe currently limit their ability to more fully penetrate the us zinc market 
if our customers in any of the end user markets we serve were to shift their production outside the us and canada  then those customers would likely source zinc overseas  and  as a result  our net sales and results of operations would be adversely affected 
if we cannot compete other than by reducing prices  we may lose market share and suffer reduced profit margins 
if our competitors lower their prices  it could inhibit our ability to compete for customers with higher value added sales and could lead to a reduction in our sales volumes and profit 
if our product mix changed as a result of competitive pricing  it could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
if we fail to implement our business strategy  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  factors such as increased competition  legal and regulatory developments  general economic conditions or increased operating costs could prevent us from increasing our capacity  implementing further productivity improvements or continuing to enhance our business and product mix 
an important part of our strategy is to grow our business by expanding our capacity to produce zinc oxide and increase the volume of eaf dust that we process 
we converted an existing refining column at our monaca facility and have constructed and placed into service in early january  a new kiln at our rockwood  tennessee facility 
we have also initiated additional capacity expansion projects 
we may need additional financing to implement our expansion strategy and we may not have access to the funding required for the expansion on acceptable terms 
our construction costs may also increase to levels that would make our facilities unprofitable to operate 
our planned capacity expansions may also suffer significant delays or cost overruns as a result of a variety of factors  such as shortages of workers or materials  transportation constraints  adverse weather  unforeseen difficulties or labor issues  any of which could prevent us from completing our expansion plans as currently expected 
our expansion plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences  such as the diversion of management s attention from our existing operations 
in addition  even if we can implement our strategy  expansion in the zinc oxide market  increased sales to various industries  including the alkaline battery industry  and projected increases in eaf dust recycling may not materialize to the extent we expect  or at all  resulting in unutilized capacity 
any failure to successfully implement our business strategy  including for any of the above reasons  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may  in addition  decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time 
work stoppages and other labor matters could interrupt our production or increase our costs  either of which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of december   we had  employees   or  of whom were covered by union contracts 
six of the eight collective bargaining agreements to which we are a party are scheduled to expire in the 
table of contents remaining two agreements are scheduled to expire in we may be unable to resolve any of these contract negotiations without work stoppages or significant increases in costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and operating results 
we may be unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees and their unions  and we may encounter strikes  further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees which may interfere with our production or increase our costs  either of which would negatively impact our operating results 
equipment or power failures  delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales and or negatively impact our net income 
an interruption in production or service capabilities at any of our six production facilities as a result of equipment or power failure or other reasons could limit our ability to deliver products to our customers  reducing our net sales and net income and potentially damaging relationships with our customers 
any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations  damage to our reputation and or permanent loss of customers 
any such production stoppage or delay could also require us to make unplanned capital expenditures 
furthermore  because many of our customers are  to varying degrees  dependent on deliveries from our facilities  customers that have to reschedule their own production due to our missed deliveries could pursue financial claims against us 
our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires  explosions  adverse weather conditions or other events 
we have experienced  and may experience in the future  periods of reduced production as a result of repairs that are necessary to our kiln  smelting and refinery operations 
if any of these events occur in the future  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our insurance policies may not cover all of our losses and we could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from  among other things  physical damage  business interruptions and product liability 
fluctuations in the cost or availability of electricity  coke  coal and or natural gas would lead to higher manufacturing costs  thereby reducing our margins and limiting our cash flows from operations 
energy is one of our most significant costs  comprising approximately million of our production costs in our processes rely on electricity  coke and natural gas in order to operate  our freight operations depend heavily on the availability of diesel fuel  and our monaca power plant uses coal to generate electricity for our operations in that facility 
energy prices  particularly for electricity  natural gas  coal  coke and diesel fuel  have been volatile in recent years and currently exceed historical averages 
these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in electricity  natural gas and coke costs would have reduced our income from operations by approximately million for fiscal in addition  in the event of an interruption in the supply of coal to our power plant at our monaca facility  that facility would be required to purchase electricity  which may not be available  and would be subject to the same risks related to an increase in electricity costs 
in addition  at most of our facilities we do not maintain sources of secondary power  and therefore any prolonged interruptions in the supply of energy to our facilities could result in lengthy production shutdowns  increased costs associated with restarting production and waste of production in progress 
we have experienced rolling power outages in the past  and any future outages would reduce our production capacity  reducing our net sales and potentially impacting our ability to deliver products to our customers 
if we were to lose order volumes from any of our major customers  our sales could decline significantly and our cash flows may be reduced 
in  our ten largest customers were responsible for of our consolidated sales 
a loss of order volumes from  or a loss of industry share by  any major customer could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations by lowering sales volumes  increasing costs and lowering profitability 
in addition  several of our customers have become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and have defaulted on their obligations to us in recent years 
we may be required to record significant additional reserves for accounts receivable from customers which may have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents in addition  approximately by volume of our zinc product shipments in were to customers who do not have long term contractual arrangements with us 
these customers purchase products and services from us on a spot basis and may choose not to continue to purchase our products and services 
the loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a negative impact on our sales volume and business 
our operations are subject to numerous federal and state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our employees  and changes in health and safety regulation could result in significant costs  which would reduce our margins and adversely affect our cash flow from operations 
we are subject to the requirements of the osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we are also subject to federal and state laws regarding operational safety 
costs and liabilities related to worker safety may be incurred and any violation of health and safety laws or regulations could impose substantial costs on us 
possible future developments  including stricter safety laws for workers or others  regulations and enforcement policies and claims for personal injury or property damages resulting from our operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities that could reduce the amount of cash that we would otherwise have to distribute or use to service our indebtedness or further enhance our business 
litigation related to worker safety may result in significant liabilities and limit our profitability 
we may be involved in claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injuries predominantly suffered because of or occupational exposure to substances at our facilities 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
if these claims and lawsuits  individually or in the aggregate  were finally resolved against us  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to stringent environmental regulation  which may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities that could materially harm our operating results 
our business is subject to a wide variety of environmental regulations and our operations expose us to a wide variety of potential environmental liabilities 
for example  we recycle eaf dust  which is listed and regulated as a hazardous waste under the epa s solid waste resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
our failure to properly process and handle eaf dust could result in significant liability for us  including  among other things  costs for health related claims or for removal or treatment of hazardous substances 
in addition  as part of the asset purchase out of bankruptcy  we inherited several environmental issues of our predecessor at our palmerton facility cited in a epa and pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep consent decree 
we have established a reserve in the amount of million  as of december   to cover the cost of construction of a storage building for calcine kiln feed materials at our palmerton facility and closures related to rcra at our bartlesville  oklahoma facility 
we also may incur costs related to future compliance with maximum achievable control technology mact air emission regulations relating to industrial boilers as well as future mact regulations relating to the non ferrous secondary metals production category  and these costs may be material 
in addition  pennsylvania has adopted regulations with respect to mercury emission regulations that are more stringent than federal mact regulations in this area  and such regulations may result in additional ongoing compliance expenditures 
our total cost of environmental compliance at any time depends on a variety of regulatory  technical and factual issues  some of which cannot be anticipated 
additional environmental issues could arise  or laws and regulations could be passed and promulgated  resulting in additional costs  which our reserves may not cover and which could materially harm our operating results 
our hedging strategies may fail to protect us from changes in the prices for natural gas  coal and zinc  which could reduce our gross margin and cash flow 
we pursue various hedging strategies  including entering into forward purchase contracts and put options  in order to reduce our exposure to losses from adverse changes in the prices for natural gas  coal and zinc 
our hedging 
table of contents activities vary in scope based upon the level and volatility of natural gas  coal and zinc prices and other changing market conditions 
our hedging activity may fail to protect or could harm our operating results because  among other things hedging can be expensive  particularly during periods of volatile prices  available hedges may not correspond directly with the risks that we are seeking to protect ourselves against  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the risk that we are seeking to protect ourselves against  and the counterparty to a hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay or deliver under the forward contract 
we depend on the service of key individuals  the loss of whom could materially harm our business 
our success will depend  in part  on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees  none of whom are covered by key person insurance policies 
these individuals possess sales  marketing  engineering  manufacturing  financial and administrative skills that are critical to the operation of our business 
if we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted 
moreover  the market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to succeed members of our management team or other key employees  should the need arise 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property  particularly our proprietary technology related to the recycling of eaf dust and the smelting of recycled zinc  and our market share and results of operations could be harmed 
we rely upon proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our competitors could gain knowledge of our know how or trade secrets  either directly or through one or more of our employees or other third parties 
if one or more of our competitors can use or independently develop such know how or trade secrets  our market share  sales volumes and profit margins could be adversely affected 
we depend on third parties for transportation services  and their failure to deliver raw material to us or finished products to our customers could increase our costs and harm our reputation and operating results 
we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture  as well as the delivery of eaf dust to our recycling plants and other raw materials  including recycled zinc  to our monaca production facility 
in particular  a substantial portion of the raw materials we use is transported by railroad  which is highly regulated 
if any of our third party transportation providers were to fail to deliver our products in a timely manner  we may be unable to sell those products at full value  or at all 
similarly  if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner  we may be unable to meet customer demand 
in addition  if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us  we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could disrupt our operations  harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
the market price for shares of our common stock has declined substantially in recent months and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
the market for common stock has recently been subject to significant disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of these securities  which may or may not have corresponded to the business or financial success of the particular company 
the market price for shares of our common stock has declined substantially in recent months and could decline further if our future operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of market analysts and investors or current economic or market conditions persist or worsen

provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation and by laws could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party and may prevent attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions in our amended certificate of incorporation and by laws and of delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management and board of directors 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change of control or change our management and board of directors 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and limit the return  if any  you are able to achieve on your investment in us

our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied in any forward looking statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described in risk factors 
overview our history we are a leading us producer of zinc and zinc based products 
our products are used in a wide variety of applications  including in the galvanizing of fabricated steel products and as components in rubber tires  alkaline batteries  paint  chemicals and pharmaceuticals 
we believe that we are the largest refiner of zinc oxide and pw zinc metal in north america 
we believe we are also the largest north american recycler of eaf dust  a hazardous waste produced by the steel mini mill manufacturing process 
we  together with our predecessors  have been operating in the zinc industry for more than years 
while we vary our raw material inputs  or feedstocks  based on cost and availability  we generally produce our zinc products using nearly recycled zinc  including zinc recovered from our eaf dust recycling operations 
we believe that our ability to convert recycled zinc into finished products results in lower feed costs than for smelters that rely primarily on zinc concentrates 
our four eaf dust recycling facilities also generate service fee revenue from steel mini mills by providing a convenient and safe means for recycling their eaf dust 
economic conditions and outlook economic conditions began to significantly deteriorate in the fourth quarter of across a broad spectrum of the economy and continued to weaken in early we expect the economy to remain weak in the near term 
our results reflect the negative impact this has had on the markets we serve  in particular the tire and rubber market  the hot dipped galvanizing market and the eaf dust recycling market 
factors affecting our operating results market price for zinc 
since we generate the substantial majority of our net sales from the sale of zinc and zinc based products  our operating results depend heavily on the prevailing market price for zinc 
our principal raw materials are zinc extracted from recycled eaf dust and other zinc bearing secondary materials purchased feedstock or purchased feed that we purchase from third parties 
costs to acquire and recycle eaf dust  which  during  comprised approximately of our raw materials  were not impacted directly by fluctuations in the market price of zinc on the lme 
the price of our finished products is impacted directly by changes in the market price of zinc  which can result in rapid and significant changes in our monthly revenues 
zinc prices experienced a period of general decline between and  primarily due to increased exports from china and declines in global zinc consumption 
during  however  zinc prices began to recover  primarily due to increases in global zinc demand  including in china  and to declines in global production due to closed or permanently idled zinc mining and smelting capacity 
zinc prices rose throughout and to a historical high of per pound on december  and fell steadily to per pound on december  zinc prices averaged per pound in january and per pound in february we pay a percentage of the lme average zinc price for our purchased feedstock 
in the second half of  we began to aggressively pursue cost reduction initiatives as a result of the decrease in the price of zinc on the lme 
one such initiative was to reduce the price we pay for our purchased feedstock expressed as a percentage of the lme zinc price 
we were successful reducing the price we pay  but were not able to acquire the same volume of 
table of contents purchased feeds that we could at higher prices 
the reduction in availability of purchased feed along with a decrease in demand in our end markets led us to move from a six furnace operation to a five furnace operation at our monaca smelter 
in  the lme average zinc price fell approximately from the fourth quarter of significantly reduced construction activity and sharply reduced demand for automobiles  particularly in the fourth quarter of  brought on by the global recession caused demand for zinc products to fall faster than production cuts and announced mine closures 
we expect that average lme zinc prices will remain at or near their current levels during due to continued economic weakness 
to mitigate the effects of any decrease in the lme average zinc price  we hedged approximately of our expected zinc production in and through the purchase of put options whereby we would receive a minimum price per pound for the quantity hedged 
we paid a total of million for the options and received million in cash as the options settled 
in october  we sold the put options for million resulting in a million gain 
we replaced the options with similar options having a strike price of per pound for a cost of million to mitigate the effects of any further decrease in the lme average zinc price 
we have not purchased any put options for for a further discussion see results from operating activities in the liquidity and capital resources section 
demand for zinc based products 
we generate revenue from the sale of zinc metal  zinc oxide  zinc and copper based powders  as well as from the collection and recycling of eaf dust 
for the periods of through mid year  north american consumption of pw zinc metal the grade of zinc metal in which we specialize and zinc oxide the value added zinc based product from which we generate the most net sales on an historical basis had increased 
because of the need to perform additional maintenance on key equipment that was deferred due to our predecessor s financial difficulties  we had not been able to produce at capacity to take full advantage of this consumption increase 
production of zinc at our monaca facility declined  primarily due to this delayed maintenance on equipment  from approximately  tons in to approximately  tons per year in and and approximately  in to meet demand  we purchased and resold metal to our customers during that period 
we began to reduce these purchases in and further in for the period from the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of  we produced at a per annum rate of  tons 
demand for our products and services decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of due to the severe economic slowdown and is expected to remain at decreased levels in the near term 
weekly steel production declined approximately during the fourth quarter of thereby reducing the amount of eaf dust generated 
in response  we suspended our recycling operations during the december holiday period and resumed them at a reduced level in early january during the first quarter of  we expect to operate our recycling operations below capacity 
additionally  we suspended operations at our smallest  highest cost recycling facility located in beaumont  texas 
we expect to resume operations at beaumont and return to a six furnace operation at our monaca facility when market conditions improve 
production for was reduced to  tons due to the reduced demand for our products 
the table below illustrates historical sales volumes and revenues for each of the zinc products and eaf dust volumes revenue ton tons  in thousands in us dollars product zinc products eaf dust cost of sales excluding depreciation 
our cost of producing zinc products consists principally of purchased feedstock  energy  maintenance and labor costs 
in  approximately of our operating costs were feedstock related reflecting  in part  our efforts to increase the use of eaf dust based feedstock as well as the decline in the lme average zinc price during the year 
the remaining were conversion related 
other components of cost of sales include transportation costs  as well as other manufacturing expenses 
the main factors that influence our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales are fluctuations in zinc prices  production and shipment volumes  efficiencies  
table of contents energy costs  our ability to implement cost control measures aimed at improving productivity and our efforts to reduce our conversion costs 
a majority of our purchased feedstock is priced at a discount to the lme 
we value our inventories using the weighted average actual cost method 
under this method  the cost of our purchased feedstock generally takes three to four months to flow through our cost of sales 
in an environment of rapidly declining lme average zinc prices our inventory cost can exceed the market value of our finished goods 
a significant lower of cost or market lcm adjustment can result 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded an lcm adjustment of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all sales and marketing expenditures  as well as administrative overhead costs  such as salary and benefit costs for sales personnel and administrative staff  expenses related to the use and maintenance of administrative offices  other administrative expenses  including expenses relating to logistics and information systems and legal and accounting expense  and other selling expenses  including travel costs 
salary and benefit costs historically have comprised the largest single component of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales historically have been impacted by changes in salary and benefit costs  as well as by changes in sales revenues 
trends affecting our business our operating results are and will be influenced by a variety of factors  including lme price of zinc  changes in cost of energy and fuels  gain and loss of customers  pricing pressures from competitors  including new entrants into the eaf dust recycling market  decline in use of zinc products  expansion into new products and expansion of our capacity  each of which requires us to incur costs prior to generating revenues  expenditures required to comply with environmental and other operational regulations  access to credit by customers  and our operational efficiency improvement programs 
we have experienced fluctuations in our sales and operating profits in recent years due to fluctuations in zinc and energy prices 
historically  zinc prices have been extremely volatile  and we expect that volatility to continue 
for example  the lme price of zinc rose from per pound on december  to per pound on december  and has since fallen to as low as per pound on december  changes in zinc pricing have impacted our revenues  since the prices of the products we sell are based primarily on lme zinc prices 
changes in zinc pricing have also impacted our costs of production  since the prices of some of our feedstocks are based on lme zinc prices 
therefore  since a large portion of our sales and a portion of our costs are affected by the lme zinc price  we expect that changing zinc prices will continue to impact our operations and financial results in the future and any significant drop in zinc prices will negatively impact our results of operations 
we employ various hedging instruments to hedge the selling prices of a portion of our expected production 
energy is one of our most significant costs 
our processes rely on electricity  coke and natural gas in order to operate 
our freight operations depend heavily on the availability of diesel fuel  and our monaca power plant uses coal to generate electricity for our operations in that facility 
energy prices  particularly for electricity  natural gas  coal  coke and diesel fuel  have been volatile in recent years and have exceeded historical averages during these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility 
the historically high zinc prices of the past two years have also made it attractive for new competitors to enter the eaf dust recycling market to compete for dust generated by existing eaf producers as well as anticipated new 
table of contents eaf capacity 
the entry of new competitors could have an adverse impact on our price realization and market share from eaf dust recycling 
for example  during the second quarter steel dust recycling started up its waelz kiln facility located in alabama and the heritage group has built an eaf dust processing facility in arkansas with plans to begin operations in in addition  zincox announced the groundbreaking for its dust recycling plant in ohio in june  since  our management has been focused on opportunities to improve our results of operations by improving operational efficiencies 
we have reduced our manufacturing costs by increasing our usage of low cost feedstock  reducing our energy consumption  streamlining our organizational structure and implementing six sigma based process improvement initiatives 
we intend to continue to focus on these and similar initiatives in the future 
we believe that our ability to capitalize on these and other efficiency improvements will help us to improve our margins 
our management is also focused on increasing our eaf dust recycling capabilities  in order to capture opportunities created by the expansion in the eaf dust recycling market that we anticipate when current economic conditions improve 
we increased our eaf dust recycling capacity by in early and have expansion projects currently underway to further increase that capacity by 
these projects could be completed and brought online as early as the first quarter of or later depending on market conditions 
we increased our zinc oxide production capacity by in early our zinc products compete with other materials in many of their applications  and in some cases our customers may shift to new processes or products 
for example  our zinc is used by steel fabricators in the hot dip galvanizing process  in which steel is coated with zinc in order to protect it from corrosion 
demand for our zinc as a galvanizing material may shift depending on how customers view the respective merits of hot dip galvanizing and paint 
our ability to anticipate shifts in product usage and to produce new products to meet our current and future customers needs will significantly impact our operating results 
we also face intense competition from regional  national and global providers of zinc based products  and the growth of any of those competitors could reduce our market share and negatively impact our operating results 
finally  our business is subject to a wide variety of environmental and other regulations and our operations expose us to a wide variety of potential liabilities 
our total cost of environmental compliance at any time depends on a variety of regulatory  technical and factual issues  some of which cannot be anticipated 
changes in regulations and or our failure to comply with existing regulations can result in significant capital expenditure requirements or penalties 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note b to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
certain of these accounting polices are described below 
inventories inventories  which consist primarily of zinc bearing materials  zinc products and supplies and spare parts  are valued at the lower of cost or market using a moving average cost method 
raw materials are purchased  as well as produced from the processing of eaf dust 
supplies and spare parts inventory used in the production process are purchased 
work in process and finished goods inventories are valued based on the costs of raw materials plus applicable conversion costs  including depreciation and overhead costs relating to associated process facilities 
zinc is traded as a commodity on the lme and  accordingly  product inventories are subject to price fluctuations 
when reviewing inventory for the lower of cost or market  we consider the forward zinc prices as quoted on the lme as of the reporting date in determining our estimate of net realizable value to determine if an adjustment is required 
our product revenues are based on the current or prior months lme average zinc price 
our valuations have been reliable in the past because the lme average zinc price upon which our product revenue is based has been reasonably correlated with the forward lme zinc prices that we use to make the lower of cost or market adjustments 

table of contents financial instruments the following methods are used to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  notes payable due within one year  accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
we enter into certain financial swap and financial option instruments that are carried at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
we measure fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
we recognize changes in fair value within the consolidated statements of income as they occur see note o to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we do not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless we have an existing asset or obligation or anticipate a future activity that is likely to occur and will result in exposing us to market risk 
we use various strategies to manage our market risk  including the use of derivative instruments to limit  offset or reduce such risk 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage well defined commodity price risks from our primary business activity 
the fair values of derivative instruments are based upon our analysis of valuations provided by third party counter parties with whom we have entered into substantially identical derivative contracts 
we compare the valuations to ensure that there is an acceptable level of consistency among them 
the valuations utilize forward pricing of the underlying commodity and are therefore subject to fluctuation based on the movements of the commodity markets 
our estimates reflect the general downward trend of the commodity markets in fiscal we are exposed to credit loss in cases where counter parties with which we have entered into derivative transactions are unable to pay us when they owe us funds as a result of agreements with them 
to minimize the risk of such losses  we use highly rated counter parties that meet certain requirements 
we currently do not anticipate that any of our counter parties will default on their obligations to us 
additionally  in october of we sold put options we purchased for at a cost of million primarily to reduce our exposure to credit risk with the counter parties to these options 
we received cash of million on the sale resulting in a pre tax gain of million in  of which million was recognized in the first nine months and million was recognized in the fourth quarter 
we subsequently replaced these options with similar options for having a lower strike price for the same quantity of tons for a cost of approximately million 
impairment we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
at december   our market value as indicated by the closing price of our common stock was million 
our net book value was million 
we further examined our assets and found no events that would suggest a potential impairment 
we have no goodwill or intangible assets 
in the event we would determine the carrying amounts would not be recovered  an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value 
fair value would be measured in accordance with sfas recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
the enhanced disclosures address how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas and its related interpretations  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  adoption of sfas will not impact our operations 
we are currently evaluating its effect on future disclosures

consequently  changes in the lme average zinc price are not fully realized until subsequent periods 
the lme average zinc prices for the most recent eight fiscal quarters and the average lme zinc prices for the year to date as of the end of each quarter are listed in the table below average lme zinc fiscal quarter ended fiscal quarter ended price march june september december march june september december quarter year to date year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the net decrease was attributable to a million decrease in price realization and a million decrease in co product and miscellaneous sales 
partially offsetting our decreases in net sales was a million net increase in sales volume reflecting increases in shipments of metal and powders and in eaf dust receipts and a decrease in shipments of zinc oxide 
additionally  our hedging activity increased our net sales by million 
the average premium to the lme on zinc products sold for fiscal versus fiscal declined for zinc metal but improved for zinc oxide 
zinc product shipments for fiscal were  tons  or  on a zinc contained basis  compared to  tons  or  tons on a zinc contained basis for fiscal the average sales price realization for zinc products on a zinc contained basis  excluding the effects from the settlement of our put options and the non cash mark to market adjustments of our open hedge positions  was per pound for fiscal compared to per pound for fiscal the decrease in fiscal reflected the per pound  or  decline  in the average lme zinc price from fiscal the decline was particularly sharp in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when it declined per pound  or of the total change from fiscal the decline reflected the general economic slowdown that began in december and that continued through fiscal 
table of contents our hedging positions partially mitigated the fluctuations in our revenues caused by the changing lme zinc prices 
for fiscal  our revenues were increased by favorable non cash mark to market adjustments of million on our hedge positions 
in october of  our revenues were further increased by a million gain on the sale of our zinc put options 
we received million in cash from the sale 
finally  our revenues were increased for option hedge positions that settled during the year for million in excess of their previously recorded market values 
we received million in cash payments at settlement 
for fiscal  our revenues were decreased by an unfavorable non cash mark to market adjustment of million on our hedge positions 
we made million in cash payments at settlement 
net sales of zinc metal decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in price realization reflecting the decline in the lme average zinc price in fiscal from fiscal partially offsetting the decrease in price realization was a million increase in shipment volume 
the sales volume increase was driven by an increase in tons shipped to our customers in the brass and battery manufacturing related businesses as well as the strong hot dipped galvanizing market through the third quarter of fiscal shipments slowed significantly in the fourth quarter as the hot dipped galvanizing and brass markets softened due to weakened demand for our customers products and services 
net sales of zinc oxide decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease was attributable to a million decrease in price realization due primarily to lower average lme zinc prices in fiscal versus fiscal partially offset by the lag effect of pricing a majority of our zinc oxide shipments on prior months average lme zinc prices 
the average lme zinc price was per pound for fiscal compared to per pound for fiscal we realized a premium to the lme on sales of zinc oxide in both fiscal and  reflecting the lag effect and the movements of the average lme zinc prices from the immediately preceding quarters 
a million decrease in shipment volume further reduced our net sales for fiscal the volume decrease was mainly caused by decreased shipments to our largest tire customers reflecting the general slowdown in the market  particularly in the fourth quarter 
net sales of zinc and copper based powder decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal this decrease was attributable to decreases in both shipment volumes and price realization 
revenues from eaf dust recycling increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal increased volume led to an increase in revenues of million 
the increased volume primarily reflected increased steel production by our eaf customers through the third quarter of fiscal steel production declined significantly in the fourth quarter reflecting the general economic slowdown 
eaf dust revenues for fiscal were based on  tons versus  tons for fiscal a decrease in price realization reduced revenues by million 
cost of sales excluding depreciation 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the change in percentage reflected the net effect of changes in the average lme zinc prices on our net sales and cost of sales 
changes in the average lme zinc price are restricted to the purchased feed component of our cost of sales  therefore any changes in the average lme zinc price have a smaller effect on our cost of sales than on our net sales 
excluding the effect the hedges had on our net sales  cost of sales would have been and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the cost of zinc material and other products sold decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of a net million decrease in the cost of produced metal  oxide and powders shipped in fiscal compared to fiscal  a million decrease in cost of brokered metal shipped and a million decrease in the shipment volume of zinc oxide 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in shipment volume of produced metal and a million increase in our recycling and other costs 
the million cost decrease was driven primarily by a million decrease in purchased feed costs partially offset by a million increase in conversion costs 
in fiscal  we reduced the number of purchased feed tons consumed by 
we also reduced the percentage of purchased feed used in our feed mix to in fiscal from in fiscal our smelter recovery in 
table of contents fiscal improved to from for fiscal we consumed less feedstock in fiscal than fiscal partly in response to our efforts to reduce our usage of purchased feed and partly due to our reduced production level resulting from the reduced demand for our products 
our purchased feed costs were further reduced by the decline in the lme average zinc price compared to fiscal the increase in our conversion costs reflected a million increase in our energy costs  of which million related to an increase in the cost of coke 
our cost of sales also included a million lcm adjustment relating to a write down of inventory values during the fourth quarter  and costs totaling million relating to the start up of the new kiln placed in service in january at our rockwood  tennessee facility and an unplanned outage at the power plant located at our monaca  pennsylvania facility 
the cost of eaf dust services increased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase was the result of a million increase in the cost of the services provided reflecting primarily an increase in fuel and transportation costs and a million increase in volume of eaf dust received 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase reflected the increase in assets placed in service during fiscal  most notably the kiln expansion project at our rockwood  tennessee facility which was completed and placed into service in january selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase reflected primarily increased legal and audit expenses and other costs associated with our public company status  namely activities associated with our sarbanes oxley implementation  directors fees and public company filing fees not incurred for the full year of fiscal and an increase in bad debt expense 
non cash compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the decrease was attributable primarily to lower debt levels in substantially all of our debt was repaid in the second and third quarters of fiscal in conjunction with a private placement of our common stock in april and the initial public offering of our common stock in august interest and other income decreased million for fiscal the decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in interest earned on excess cash during fiscal and a million loss on disposal of miscellaneous assets in fiscal income tax provision 
our income tax provision was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal our effective tax rates were for fiscal and for fiscal net income 
for the reasons stated above  our net income decreased to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the net increase was attributable to increases in price realization of million and co product and miscellaneous sales of million partially offset by a sales volume decrease of million 
the remaining million increase related to the mark to market adjustments on various hedging instruments we employed to hedge the selling prices of a portion of our expected production 
net sales for fiscal and fiscal were reduced by mark to market adjustments of million and million  respectively 
the average sales price realization for zinc products on a zinc contained basis was per pound for fiscal versus per pound for fiscal the increase in price realization was due to a higher premium to the lme on zinc products sold and the lag effect of record high lme average zinc prices in the fourth quarter of fiscal being partially realized in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  the year to date lme average zinc prices for the first three quarters of fiscal were higher than full year fiscal as illustrated in the table above 

table of contents the lme average zinc price declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal to bring the year to date average to per pound for fiscal versus per pound for fiscal zinc product shipments decreased  tons  or  to  tons  or  tons on a zinc contained basis  for fiscal compared to  tons  or  tons on a zinc contained basis  for fiscal the decrease reflected primarily a decrease in shipments of zinc metal partially offset by an increase in shipments of zinc oxide 
the decrease in shipments of zinc metal reflected decreases in both brokered metal and zinc metal produced of  tons and  tons  respectively 
net sales of zinc metal decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales volume of million partially offset by an increase in price realization of million 
the reduced sales volume primarily reflected reduced shipment levels of brokered metal and an increase in the quantity of produced metal further processed into zinc oxide 
the increase in price realization reflected the higher lme average zinc price during most of fiscal as mentioned above and a higher average premium to the lme on zinc products sold 
net sales of zinc oxide increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in price realization of million and a shipment volume increase of million 
the increase in price realization reflected the lag effect of record high lme average zinc prices in the fourth quarter of fiscal being partially realized in the first quarter of fiscal as well as the year to date lme average zinc prices for the first three quarters of fiscal exceeding the full year fiscal average 
the increased shipment volume reflected the settlement of a fourth quarter work stoppage at the operations of our largest oxide customer 
consumption in returned to pre work stoppage levels 
net sales of zinc and copper based powder increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in price realization of million partially offset by a decrease in sales volume of million 
revenues from eaf dust recycling decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal decreased volume led to a decrease in revenues of million 
the decreased volume primarily reflected reduced steel production by our eaf customers 
eaf dust revenues for fiscal were based on  tons versus  tons for fiscal a decrease in price realization reduced revenues by million 
cost of sales excluding depreciation 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales was for fiscal versus for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a cost increase of million partially offset by a shipment volume decrease of million 
the volume decrease was caused by decreases of million and million in brokered metal and produced metal shipments  respectively  a decrease of million in zinc and copper based powder shipments partially offset by a million increase in oxide shipments 
the cost increase of million was primarily attributable to a million increase in conversion costs and a million increase in purchased feed costs at our monaca smelter partially offset by a million decrease in recycling and other costs 
the largest components of the conversion cost increase were a million increase in labor and maintenance costs  a million increase in utilities and a net million increase in supplies  fuels  additives and other costs 
the increase in labor and maintenance costs included million in signing bonuses related to the collective bargaining unit agreements negotiated in at our palmerton  calumet and monaca facilities 
the purchased feed cost increase reflected the higher average lme zinc price for the majority of as well as a increase in the percentage of the average lme zinc price we paid for our purchased feeds 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the quantity of purchased feeds used in fiscal depreciation 
depreciation expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in property  plant and equipment in fiscal capital expenditures were million in fiscal

although the lme average price of zinc during fiscal declined from the average level for the month of december  it was at historically high levels during the first nine months of fiscal and contributed to our positive cash flow from operations for the period

the cost reduction in both the raw material and finished inventories also reflected a million lcm adjustment

inflation inflation can affect us in two principal ways 
first  a significant portion of our debt is tied to prevailing short term interest rates that may change due to changes in inflation rates  translating into changes in our interest expense 
second  inflation can impact material purchases  energy  labor and other costs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations in recent years 
however  if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  either as described above or otherwise  we may not be ably to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
seasonality due in large part to the diverse end markets into which we sell our products and services  our sales are generally not impacted by seasonality with the exception of a slight reduction in demand in the fourth quarter of the year as some customers reduce production during the period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates and the prices of zinc  lead  natural gas and coal 
we have historically used derivative instruments  such as swaps  put options and forward purchase contracts to manage the effect of these changes 
when we use forward contract hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to rising energy prices  we are limited in our ability to take advantage of future reductions in energy prices  because the hedging instruments require us to exercise the hedging instrument at the settlement date regardless of the market price at the time 
we have also used put options to reduce our exposure 
table of contents to future declines in zinc prices 
we have entered into arrangements hedging a portion of our exposure to future changes in the prices of zinc and lead for and our risk management policy seeks to meet our overall goal of managing our exposure to market price risk  particularly risks related to changing zinc prices 
all derivative contracts are held for purposes other than trading and are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility of expected cash flow and cover underlying exposures 
we are exposed to losses in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the derivative contracts discussed below  as well as any similar contracts we may enter into in future periods 
counter parties are evaluated for creditworthiness and risk assessment both prior to our initiating contract activities and on an ongoing basis 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our senior secured credit facilities  which provide for borrowings of up to million at december   all of which bears interest at variable rates 
assuming that our senior secured credit facilities are fully drawn and holding other variables constant and excluding the impact of any hedging arrangements  each one percentage point change in interest rates would be expected to have an impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million 
we may enter into interest rate swaps  involving the exchange of a portion of our floating rate interest obligations for fixed rate interest obligations  to reduce interest rate volatility 
however  we cannot assure you that any interest rate swaps we implement will be effective 
commodity price risk our business consists principally of the sale of zinc metal and other zinc based products 
as a result  our results of operations are subject to risk of fluctuations in the market price of zinc 
while our finished products are generally priced based on a spread to the price of zinc on the lme  our revenues are impacted significantly by changes in the market price of zinc 
changes in zinc prices will also impact our ability to generate revenue from our eaf recycling operations as well as our ability to procure raw materials 
in addition  we consume substantial amounts of energy in our zinc production and eaf dust recycling operations  and therefore our cost of sales is vulnerable to changes in prevailing energy prices  particularly natural gas  coke and coal 
in december  we purchased put options for for a financial hedge for approximately  tons of zinc   tons monthly  or approximately of our anticipated sales volume 
the cost of these options was approximately million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated financial statements for the options settled on a monthly basis  and in each settlement we were entitled to receive the amount  if any  by which the option strike price  set at per pound for the duration of  exceeds the average lme price for zinc during the preceding month 
similar put options for  tons   tons monthly were purchased during the first four months of for each of the months of with a per pound strike price  for a cost of approximately million 
in october of  we sold the put options we purchased for primarily to reduce our exposure to credit risk with the counter parties to these options 
we received cash of million on the sale resulting in a pre tax gain of million in  of which million was recognized in the first nine months and million was recognized in the fourth quarter 
the gain is recorded as an increase in our net sales 
we subsequently replaced these options with similar options for having a lower strike price for the same quantity of tons for a cost of approximately million 
the options are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we were party to a contract for the purchase and delivery of the coal requirements for the power plant in monaca through each year  we enter into contracts for the forward purchase of natural gas to cover the majority of natural gas requirements in order to reduce our exposure to the volatility of natural gas prices
