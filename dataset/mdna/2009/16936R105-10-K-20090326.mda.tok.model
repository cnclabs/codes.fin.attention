this is a normal capital circulation and the company believes that it will not have a material adverse effect on future cash flows 
second  cash outflow caused by increased notes receivable was about  mainly due to the company having sufficient working capital  thus having less notes receivable discounted during this period 
since the notes receivable were based on bank credit standing  they may turn into cash any time the company elects

foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  and fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
the company conducts virtually all of its business in china and  accordingly  the sale of its products is settled primarily in rmb 
as a result  devaluation or currency fluctuation of the rmb against the us would adversely affect the company s financial performance when measured in us dollars 
in july  the chinese government adjusted its exchange rate policy from fixed rate to floating rate 
during july to july  the exchange rate between rmb and us dollars experienced a big fluctuation  for rmb to us and rmb to us  respectively 
since august  the exchange rate has maintained stable  and was approximately at rmb to us 
there can be no assurance that the exchange rate will remain stable 
the renminbi could devalue against the us dollar 
the company s financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by changes in the value of certain currencies other than the renminbi in which the company s earnings and obligations are denominated 
in particular  a devaluation of the renminbi is likely to increase the portion of the company s cash flow required to satisfy the company s foreign currency denominated obligations
