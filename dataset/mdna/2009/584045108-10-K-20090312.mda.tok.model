the non gaap adjusted ebitda margin declined due to the impact of an increased mix of revenue from our revenue cycle management segment which generally exhibits lower non gaap adjusted ebitda margins as compared to our spend management segment 
segment structure and revenue streams we deliver our solutions through two business segments  revenue cycle management and spend management 
management s primary metrics to measure segment financial performance are net revenue  non gaap gross fees and segment adjusted ebitda 
all of our revenues are from external customers and inter segment revenues have been eliminated 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements herein for discussion on segment adjusted ebitda and certain items of our segment results of operations and financial position 
revenue cycle management our revenue cycle management segment provides a comprehensive suite of software and services spanning the revenue cycle workflow of hospitals  health systems and other ancillary healthcare providers from patient admission  estimation of patient ability to pay  charge capture  case management  contract management and health information management through claims processing and accounts receivable management 
our workflow solutions  together with our data management and business intelligence tools  increase revenue capture and cash collections  reduce accounts receivable balances and improve regulatory compliance 
our revenue cycle management segment revenue consists of the following components  which are also discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements subscription and implementation fees 
we earn fixed subscription fees on a monthly or annual basis on multi year contracts for customer access to our saas based solutions 
we also charge our customers upfront fees for implementation services 
implementation fees are earned over the subscription period or estimated customer relationship period  whichever is longer 
transaction fees 
for certain revenue cycle management solutions  we earn fees that vary based on the volume of customer transactions or enrolled members 
software related fees 
we earn license  consulting  maintenance and other software related service fees for our business intelligence  decision support and other software products 
we have certain revenue cycle management contracts that are sold in multiple element arrangements and include software products 
we have considered rule of regulation s x for these types of multiple element arrangements that include software products and determined the amount is below the threshold that would require separate disclosure on our statement of operations 

table of contents service fees 
for certain revenue cycle management solutions  we earn fees based on a percentage of cash remittances collected 
spend management our spend management segment provides a suite of technology enabled services that help our customers manage their non labor expense categories 
our solutions lower supply and medical device pricing and utilization by managing the procurement process through our group purchasing organization s portfolio of contracts  our consulting services and business intelligence tools 
our spend management segment revenue consists of the following components administrative fees and revenue share obligations 
we earn administrative fees from manufacturers  distributors and other vendors of products and services with whom we have contracts under which our group purchasing organization customers may purchase products and services 
administrative fees represent a percentage  which we refer to as our administrative fee ratio  typically ranging from to of the purchases made by our group purchasing organization customers through contracts with our vendors 
our group purchasing organization customers make purchases and receive shipments  directly from the vendors 
generally on a monthly or quarterly basis  vendors provide us with a report describing the purchases made by our customers through our group purchasing organization vendor contracts  including associated administrative fees 
we recognize revenue upon the receipt of these reports from vendors 
some customer contracts require that a portion of our administrative fees are contingent upon achieving certain financial improvements  such as lower supply costs  which we refer to as performance targets 
contingent administrative fees are not recognized as revenue until the customer confirms achievement of those contractual performance targets 
prior to customer confirmation that a performance target has been achieved  we record contingent administrative fees as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet 
often  recognition of this revenue occurs in periods subsequent to the recognition of the associated costs 
should we fail to meet a performance target  we may be contractually obligated to refund some or all of the contingent fees 
additionally  in certain cases  we are contractually obligated to pay a portion of the administrative fees to our hospital and health system customers 
typically this amount  or revenue share obligation  is calculated as a percentage of administrative fees earned on a particular customer s purchases from our vendors 
our total net revenue on our consolidated statements of operations is shown net of the revenue share obligation 
other service fees 
the following items are included as other service fees in our consolidated statement of operations consulting fees 
we consult with our customers regarding the costs and utilization of medical devices and implantable physician preference items  or ppi  and the efficiency and quality of their key clinical service lines 
our consulting projects are typically fixed fee projects with a duration of three to nine months  and the related revenues are earned as services rendered 
subscription fees 
we also offer technology enabled services that provide spend management analytics and data services to improve operational efficiency  reduce supply costs  and increase transparency across spend management processes 
we earn fixed subscription fees on a monthly basis for these company hosted saas based solutions 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses as follows cost of revenue 
cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct labor costs incurred to generate our revenue 
direct labor costs consist primarily of salaries  benefits  and other direct costs and share based compensation expenses related to personnel who provide services to implement our solutions for our customers 
as the majority of our services are provided internally  our costs to provide these services 
table of contents are primarily labor driven 
a less significant portion of our cost of revenue derives from third party products and services  and client reimbursed out of pocket costs 
cost of revenue does not include allocated amounts for rent  depreciation or amortization  but does include the amortization for the cost of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
as a result of the accuro acquisition and related process integration  there may be some reclassifications primarily between cost of revenue and operating expense classifications resulting from the implementation of our accounting policies that could affect period over period comparability 
product development expenses 
product development expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  and share based compensation expense of the technology professionals who develop  support and maintain our software related products and services 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to marketing programs including trade shows and brand messaging  personnel related expenses for sales and marketing employees including salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense  certain meeting costs and travel related expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for administrative employees including salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense and travel related expenses  occupancy and other indirect costs  insurance costs  professional fees  and other general overhead expenses 
depreciation 
depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of software  including capitalized costs of software developed for internal use 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles includes the amortization of all identified intangible assets with the exception of software  primarily resulting from acquisitions 
key considerations certain significant items or events must be considered to better understand differences in our results of operations from period to period 
we believe that the following items or events have had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods discussed below or may have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods revenue cycle management acquisitions the results of operations of acquired businesses the revenue cycle management acquisitions are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
since january   material acquisitions include for details regarding these acquisitions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements accuro  acquired on june   provides saas based revenue cycle management products and services to a broad range of healthcare providers 
md x  acquired on july   provides revenue cycle products and services for hospitals and health systems 
xactimed  acquired on may   provides saas based revenue cycle products and services that focus on claims management  remittance management  and denial management 
purchase accounting deferred revenue and cost adjustment 
upon acquiring accuro  xactimed and avega  we made certain purchase accounting adjustments to reduce the acquired deferred revenue and deferred cost to the fair value of outstanding services and products to be provided post acquisition 
on june   we reduced the acquired deferred revenue and deferred cost from accuro by million and million  respectively 
on may   we reduced the acquired deferred revenue from xactimed by 
table of contents million 
on january   we reduced the acquired deferred revenue from avega by million 
these changes only impacted our revenue cycle management segment 
in process research and development  or ipr d 
upon acquiring xactimed and avega  we made certain purchase accounting adjustments to write off acquired ipr d 
during the fiscal years ended december  and  we incurred charges of million and million  respectively  related to the xactimed and avega acquisitions to impair the value of acquired intangibles associated with software development costs for products that were not yet available for general release and had no alternative future use at the time of acquisition 
both charges only impacted our revenue cycle management segment 
share based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the prospective method 
our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and  reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
the impact from the adoption of sfas no 
r to our consolidated results of operations  was million  million and million of share based compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in accordance with the prospective method  our consolidated statements of operations for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
credit facility amendment in may  in connection with the completion of the accuro acquisition  we entered into the third amendment to our existing credit agreement 
the amendment increased our term loan facility by million and the commitments to loan amounts under our revolving credit facility from million to million 
the amendment also increased the applicable margins on the rate of interest we pay under our credit agreement 
upon closing this amendment  we received million of proceeds less debt issuance costs under our increased term loan facility  and we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility 
the proceeds of the million in increased borrowings and existing cash on hand were used to fund the cash portion of the accuro acquisition purchase price 
in september  a subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings inc that had extended commitments of million under our revolving credit facility filed for bankruptcy 
this lender has not funded its ratable share of borrowing requests since this filing and we do not expect that this lender will fund its pro rata share of any future borrowing requests 
accordingly  until such time as these commitments are assigned to a substitute lender  the effective commitments outstanding under the revolver have declined by million to million 
termination of interest rate swaps in june  we terminated two floating to fixed rate libor based interest rate swaps that were originally set to terminate july in consideration of the early terminations  we paid to the swap counterparty  and incurred an expense of  million for the fiscal year ended december  accordingly  the swaps are no longer recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  impairment of assets during  certain of our assets were deemed to be impaired as they no longer provided future economic benefit 
such assets primarily included certain acquired trade names  developed technology  and internally developed software 
hence  we recorded non cash impairment charges totaling million during the fiscal year ended december  initial public offering on december   we closed on our initial public offering of common stock 
as a result of the offering  we issued  shares of common stock for proceeds of million net of underwriting fees of million and other offering costs of million

revenue cycle management revenue 
revenue cycle management revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the following acquisitions 
million of the increase resulted from service revenue attributable to accuro  which we acquired on june  the operating results of accuro were included in our fiscal year ended december  from the date of acquisition and were not included in the comparable prior period 
million and million of the increase resulted from service revenue attributable to the acquisitions of xactimed and md x  respectively  which were included in our full fiscal year ended december  compared to only approximately seven and half months and six months  respectively  of operating results in the fiscal year ended december  revenue cycle management non gaap acquisition affected net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue cycle management non gaap acquisition affected net revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  given the significant impact of the revenue cycle management acquisitions on our revenue cycle management segment  we believe acquisition affected measures are useful for the comparison of our year over year net revenue growth

non acquisition related products and services 
the increase in net revenue from non acquisition related products and services was approximately million or 
this increase was comprised of million  or  in our software related subscription fees which was primarily driven by the continued market demand for our rcm compliance services 
partially offsetting the increase in our software related subscription fees was an approximate million decrease in revenue from our decision support software and services 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a million revenue loss due to a scheduled and planned step down in software support and maintenance fees from a large decision support customer 
we believe that the delay in the release of the fourth version of our decision support software limited the growth of revenue from our decision support software and services during and the fourth version was released in october and we expect that modest sales growth will occur for our decision support software in 
table of contents spend management net revenue 
spend management net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the revenue increase was primarily the result of an increase in administrative fees of million  or  partially offset by a million increase in revenue share obligations  and an increase in other service fees of million 
administrative fees 
administrative fee revenue increased by million  or  as compared to the prior period  primarily due to higher purchasing volumes by existing customers under our group purchasing organization contracts with our manufacturer and distributor vendors which totaled million 
also contributing to the above increase  we experienced a net million increase in contingent revenue recognized upon confirmation from certain customers that the respective performance targets had been achieved during the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  we may have fluctuations in our administrative fee revenue in future quarters as the timing of vendor reporting and contingent revenue may not result in discernable trends 
revenue share obligation 
revenue share obligation increased million  or  as compared to the prior period 
we analyze the impact that our revenue share obligation has on our results of operations by analyzing the revenue share ratio 
the revenue share ratio for the fiscal year ended december  was  which was relatively consistent with the revenue share ratio of for the fiscal year ended december  we may experience fluctuations in our revenue share ratio on account of changes in revenue mix and from the timing of vendor reporting 
other service fees 
the million of growth  or  in other service fees consisted of million in higher revenues from our supply chain consulting and million from our data analysis subscription services 
the consulting growth was mainly due to more consulting hours and an increased number of consulting engagements from new and existing customers  including a new engagement with a large health system whose services began in the second quarter additionally  we realized growth in the number of our subscription based customers

this increase was attributable to our direct costs totaling million associated with signing and renewing several larger spend management segment client service agreements and a moderate revenue mix shift towards our revenue cycle products and services totaling million  which traditionally provides a higher cost of revenue than our spend management revenue 
the revenue cycle management acquisitions increased our total cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenue  during the fiscal year ended december  from to primarily due to the mix of acquired revenue cycle management revenue being more service  implementation and consulting based 
a higher percentage of direct internal and external resources are required to derive related service revenue  specifically with respect to our accounts receivable collection services

spend management expenses 
spend management expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase is generally higher than the spend management revenue growth over the same period due to increased cost of delivering services to new and renewing customers in our spend management segment  including the implementation costs of our consulting totaling million and subscription services totaling million

non operating expenses interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from interest expense of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in interest primarily related to increased indebtedness resulting from the october refinancing and the july amendment 
specifically  the october refinancing replaced million of senior credit facilities with million of senior credit facilities  and the july financing provided us an additional million of senior credit facilities 
the proceeds from our indebtedness increases were primarily used to fund acquisitions and shareholder dividend payments

see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
critical accounting policy disclosure the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we find reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions 
management believes that the following accounting judgments and uncertainties are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our net revenue consists primarily of a administrative fees and b other service fee revenue that is comprised of i consulting revenues  ii subscription implementation and fees from hosting arrangements  iii transaction fees and contingency fees  and  iv software related fees 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when a there is a persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the fee is fixed or determinable  c services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
subscription and implementation fees we apply the revenue recognition guidance prescribed in eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  for our hosted solutions 
we provide subscription based revenue cycle and spend management services through software tools accessed by our customers while the data is hosted and maintained on our servers 
in many arrangements  customers are charged set up fees for implementation and monthly subscription fees for access to these web based hosted services 
implementation fees are typically billed at the beginning of the arrangement and recognized as revenue over the greater of the subscription period or the estimated customer relationship period 
we estimate the customer relationship period based on historical customer retention rates 
we currently estimate our customer relationship period to be between four and five years for our hosted services 
revenue from monthly hosting arrangements is recognized on a subscription basis over the period in which the customer uses the service 
contract subscription periods typically range from three to five years from execution 
our estimated customer relationship period may change due to the changing attrition rates of our customers 
we have historically changed our estimates of customer relationship periods for certain of our web hosted customers 
these changes in estimated customer lives have typically deferred revenue over longer periods 

table of contents software related fees we license certain revenue cycle decision support software products 
software revenues are derived from three primary sources i software licenses  ii software support  and iii services  which include consulting  product services and training programs 
we recognize revenue for our software arrangements under the guidance of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
we evaluate vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
in many of our multi element software arrangements we are unable to establish vsoe for certain of our deliverables 
the majority of our software licenses are for a term of one year which results in undeterminable vsoe 
in arrangements where vsoe cannot be determined for the separate elements of the arrangement  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the period in which the services are expected to be performed or over the software support period  whichever is longer  beginning with the delivery and acceptance of the software  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
as a result  we are required to make assumptions regarding the implementation period of each particular arrangement in order to determine the appropriate period to recognize revenue 
we evaluate the expected implementation period in which services are expected to be performed based on historical trends and current customer specific criteria 
our actual implementation periods may differ from our estimates 
in the event we have to adjust our estimate  we would record a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is changed 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing valuation analyses  in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company considers the following to be important factors that could trigger an impairment review and may result in an impairment charge significant and sustained underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  significant and sustained adverse changes in business climate or regulations  significant negative changes in senior management  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period 
we determine fair value using an estimated discounted cash flow analysis 
this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability and growth of future business strategies to determine estimated future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standard or sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
 as of january  for certain non financial assets and liabilities which will require us to evaluate those assets and liabilities within an established fair value hierarchy based on the inputs utilized in the relative valuation process 
the adoption of sfas no 
may impact future fair value assessments on certain assets  for example  the fair value of our business units in the assessment of goodwill impairment  which could result in a potential impairment 
our estimates of future cash flow used in these valuations could differ from actual results 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
based on our sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical decrease applied to our assumed growth rates used in our discounted cash flow analysis would not result in an impairment of our intangible assets nor would it cause us to further evaluate goodwill for impairment 

table of contents acquisitions purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting for business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
revised  business combinations or sfas no 
r  which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  as of january  the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions and requires a number of changes to the original pronouncement  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
other changes include requiring the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requiring the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requiring the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
our purchase price allocation methodology requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon appraised market values  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
management determines the fair value of fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets such as developed technology or customer relationships  and any other significant assets or liabilities 
we adjust the purchase price allocation  as necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies  and result in an impairment or a new allocation of purchase price 
given our history of acquisitions  we may allocate part of the purchase price of future acquisitions to contingent consideration as required by sfas no 
r 
the fair value calculation of contingent consideration will involve a number of assumptions that are subjective in nature and which may differ significantly from actual results 
we may experience volatility in our earnings to some degree in future reporting periods as a result of these fair value measurements 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific client s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as whether a customer declares bankruptcy 
other factors include the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a general reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we expect to collect from clients 
if circumstances related to specific clients change  or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses 
our bad debt expense to total net revenue ratio was approximately 
a hypothetical increase in bad debt expense would result in approximately million of additional bad debt expense for the fiscal year ended december  income taxes we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  as needed  based upon historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
our tax valuation allowance requires us to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the forecasted amount and timing of future taxable income 

table of contents we estimate the company s effective tax rate based upon the known rates and estimated state tax apportionment 
this rate is determined based upon location of company personnel  location of company assets and determination of sales on a jurisdictional basis 
we currently file returns in approximately jurisdictions 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity when realized 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
if tax law does not specify the ordering in a particular circumstance  then a pro rata approach is used 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return  and also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
on january  was recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date 
upon adoption of fin no 
 our policy is to include interest and penalties in our provision for income taxes 
the tax years through remain open to examination by certain state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
the tax year remains open to examination by the internal revenue service 
each quarter we assess our uncertain tax positions and adjust our reserve accordingly based on the most recent facts and circumstances 
if there is a significant change in the underlying facts and circumstances or applicable tax law modifications  we may be exposed to additional benefits or expense 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for the impact of uncertain tax positions in we expect an increase in our income tax expense in future years  a component of which will be attributable to the limits of our net operating loss carryforwards 
share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan  which includes non qualified stock options and non vested share awards 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  stock options  to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our share based compensation programs 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r 
effective january   we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of sfas no 
r with a prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for estimating the value of share based compensation 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date  which are subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the prospective application method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
prior to our initial public offering  valuing our share price as a privately held company was complex 
we used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants practice guide  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  in assessing and determining the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes 
the fair value of our common stock was determined through periodic valuations 
we have performed valuations of our common stock at least annually prior to our initial public offering 
our stock valuations used a combination of the market comparable approach and the income approach to estimate the aggregate enterprise value of our company at each valuation date 
the market comparable approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company market multiples of publicly traded firms in similar lines of business 
the income approach involves applying appropriate risk adjusted discount rates to estimated debt free cash flows  based on forecasted revenue and costs 
the projections used 
table of contents in connection with these valuations were based on our expected operating performance over the forecast period 
there was a high degree of subjectivity involved in using option pricing models and there was no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates resulting from these valuation models  nor was there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the resulting value may not have been indicative of the fair value observed in a market transaction between a willing buyer and willing seller 
however  we believe this to have been a reasonable approach to estimating the fair value of our stock for those periods along with our analyses of comparable companies in our industry 
determining the fair value of our stock required making complex and subjective judgments and there is inherent uncertainty in our estimate of fair value 
estimating the volatility of the share price of a privately held company was complex because there was no readily available market for the shares 
estimated volatility of our stock was based on available information on the volatility of stocks of comparable publicly traded companies 
generally accepted valuation techniques required management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our common stock 
these assumptions and judgments included estimating discounted cash flows of forecasts and projections 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques also required management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our common stock and stock option awards 
these assumptions and judgments included estimating volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and forfeiture rates  and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions would have materially affected the fair value estimate 
for grants following the initial public offering  we utilized market based share prices of our common stock in the black scholes option pricing model to calculate fair value of our common stock option awards 
this valuation technique will continue to involve highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and estimated forfeitures 
as a public entity  it is not practicable for us to estimate the expected volatility of our share price 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we have estimated grant date fair value of our shares using volatility calculated from an appropriate industry sector index of comparable entities 
we identified similar public entities for which share and option price information was available  and considered the historical volatilities of those entities share prices in calculating volatility 
dividend payments were not assumed  as we did not anticipate paying a dividend at the dates in which the various option grants occurred during the year 
the risk free rate of return reflects the weighted average interest rate offered for zero coupon treasury bonds over the expected term of the options 
the expected term of the awards represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
based on its limited history  we utilized the simplified method as prescribed in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  to calculate expected term 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards will continue to represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation could be materially different in the future 
self insurance reserves beginning january   we established a company wide self insurance plan for employee healthcare and dental insurance 
we accrue self insurance reserves based upon estimates of the aggregate liability of claim costs which are probable and estimable 
we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure on certain catastrophic claims 
our current insurance policy contains a stop loss amount of million per individual and a maximum aggregated stop loss limit of million per policy year on certain catastrophic claims 
reserves for claim costs are estimated using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and our historical experience 

table of contents self insurance reserves are based on management s estimates of the costs to settle employee insurance claims 
as such  differences between actual costs and management s estimates could be significant 
additionally  changes in actuarial assumptions used in the development of these reserves could affect net income in a given period 
changes in the nature of claims or the number of employees could also impact our estimate 
our current estimated aggregate maximum payment exposure under the insurance plan  for the current plan year  is approximately million as of december  based on the trend of rising healthcare costs  we may experience higher employee healthcare expense in future periods 
a hypothetical change in our self insured liabilities as of december  would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements ordinarily involve payment of ordinary expenses  working capital fluctuations  repayment of borrowing obligations and capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures typically consist of software capitalization and computer hardware purchases 
historically  the acquisition of complementary businesses has resulted in a significant use of cash 
our principal sources of funds have primarily been cash provided by operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from equity issuances 
we believe we currently have adequate cash flow from operations  capital resources and liquidity to meet our cash flow requirements including the following near term obligations i our working capital needs  ii debt service obligations including a required excess cash payment to our lenders of approximately million  iii our million deferred purchase payment obligation related to the accuro acquisition if we elect to satisfy this obligation in cash  iv planned capital expenditures for the next months  v our revenue share obligation and rebate payments  and  vi estimated federal and state income tax payments in the first six months of of approximately million 
historically  we have utilized federal net operating loss carryforwards nols for both regular and alternative minimum tax payment purposes 
consequently  our federal cash tax payments in past reporting periods have been minimal 
however  given the current amount and limitations of our nols  we expect our cash paid for taxes to increase significantly in future years 
we have not historically utilized borrowings available under our credit agreement to fund operations 
however  pursuant to the change in our cash management practice previously noted  we currently use the swing line component of our revolver for funding operations while we voluntarily apply our excess cash balances to reduce our swing line loan on a daily basis 
we have million available net of a million letter of credit on our revolving credit facility as of december   which matures on october  we had million available on our swing line sublimit  which is part of our revolving facility  which matures on october  we may observe fluctuations in cash flows provided by operations from period to period due to unforeseen factors 
these factors may cause us to draw additional amounts under our swing line or revolving facility and may include the following changes in working capital from the inconsistent timing of cash receipts and payments for major recurring items such as accounts receivable collections  accounts payable payments  revenue share obligation payments  incentive compensation  changes in deferred revenue  and other various items  acquisitions  and unforeseeable events or transactions 
we may continue to pursue other acquisitions or investments in the future 
we may also increase our capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in infrastructure  software solutions  and personnel  and as we expand our market presence 
cash provided by operating activities may not be sufficient to fund such expenditures 
accordingly  in addition to the use of our available revolving credit facility  we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds for such purposes 
any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising 
table of contents activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain required financing on terms satisfactory to us  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be limited 
discussion of cash flow as of december    and  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  million and million  respectively 
our cash provided by operations is generally driven by cash receipts generated by our customers offset by cash paid for the operating expenses of providing services and products to our customers 
if we continue to grow our revenues while maintaining a more modest growth rate in operating expenses  we expect cash provided by operations to continue to grow from period to period 
cash provided by operations for the fiscal year ended december  was million 
the million increase in cash provided by operations compared to the prior period is primarily due to cash receipts from higher profitability in the current year attributable to the results of operations of the businesses acquired in the revenue cycle management acquisitions  growth in our legacy revenue cycle management business and higher administrative fees and profitability at our spend management segment 
included in this increase are changes in assets and liabilities  including deferred revenue that contributed a net positive increase of million in cash compared to the prior period for cash receipts that were not yet recognized as revenue  and a net positive increase of million in accounts payable related to the timing of payments to our vendors 
offsetting the above increases in operating cash flow are i a negative cash flow impact related to accounts receivable of million primarily attributable to the increase in net revenue in  the post acquisition impact on accounts receivable related to the financial system integration of accuro and large invoices that were issued late in the fourth quarter of  ii a net increase of million in other long term assets  which was primarily attributable to the increase in post acquisition deferred implementation costs for the accuro related saas based software and service revenue that did not exist in the prior year  iii a net decrease of million in our accrued revenue share incentive and rebate obligations related to the timing of payments  and  iv a net decrease of million in other accrued expenses primarily attributable to the payout of the interest rate swap liability that was settled during the year 
in addition  during  we experienced an increase in bad debt expense of million for a total of million or of total net revenue  compared to million  or of total net revenue to the prior period to reserve for higher aging accounts receivable for services primarily related to our transaction fee and service businesses 
we will continue to monitor our customer accounts receivable balances and will make the necessary adjustments to the allowance once any collectability issues are identified 
as a result  we are currently not able to estimate any significant unusual changes to our bad debt exposure for the fiscal year  however  a continuing impact of current adverse economic conditions could affect our ability to collect customer payments in future periods 
cash provided by operations for the fiscal year ended december  was million  and primarily includes net income before non cash charges  including share based compensation expense of million and an ipr d impairment charge of million from the acquisition of xactimed 
cash provided by operations during the period was primarily driven by net collections from customers and an increase in accrued revenue share obligations and rebates 
accrued revenue share obligations and rebates typically increase at the end of our fiscal year as we remit a significant amount of revenue share obligations to customers in the first and third quarters of each year 
we believe that cash used in investing activities will continue to be materially impacted by future acquisitions  continued growth in investments in property  equipment  purchased software and capitalized software development costs 
our property  equipment and software investments consist primarily of technology infrastructure to provide capacity for expansion of our customer base  including computers and related 
table of contents equipment  and software purchased or implemented by outside parties 
our software development investments consist primarily of company managed design  development  testing and deployment of new application functionality 
cash used in investing activities increased from million for the fiscal year ended december  to million for the fiscal year ended december   mainly due to the costs of the acquisition of accuro totaling million and increased capitalized software development costs totaling million that are primarily related to the development of new products 
cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was million  and primarily relates to cash used in the acquisitions of md x and xactimed of million and million  net of cash acquired  respectively 
it also includes capital expenditures for operational growth and capitalization of software development costs 
cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was million 
the amount primarily represents the net proceeds received for debt financing of the accuro acquisition during the period 
partially offsetting the net proceeds received during the period are voluntary and mandatory repayments on our revolving credit and term loan facilities totaling million and million  respectively  and debt issuance costs associated with our may debt refinancing transactions totaling million 
cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was million 
this includes the proceeds from the july amendment see note to notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as million of borrowing under our revolving credit facility in may  and proceeds from the initial public offering  partially offset by a million payment of the dividend and a partial prepayment of indebtedness 
the debt proceeds from the amendment were primarily used to finance the acquisition of md x and to fund the dividend 
the balance of the proceeds from the amendment was used to repay million of borrowings drawn under the revolving credit facility 
we received million in net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock and subsequently used million of the proceeds to pay down indebtedness 
we also made million of quarterly principal payments on our term loan as required under our credit agreement  and we incurred million in costs related to the issuance of additional senior term debt 
credit agreement we are party to a credit agreement  with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  swing line lender and l c issuer  bnp paribas  as syndication agent  cit healthcare llc  as documentation agent  and the other lenders party thereto  or the lenders  as amended 
the agreement provides for a i term loan facility and ii a revolving loan facility with a million aggregate loan commitment amount available  including a million sub facility for letters of credit and a million swing line facility 
we utilize the revolving credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  equal to the eurodollar rate for a eurodollar rate loan as defined in the credit agreement  or the base rate for a base rate loan as defined in the credit agreement  plus an applicable margin 
under the revolving loan facility we also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving loan facility ranging from to based on the same consolidated leverage ratio and a quarterly fee equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans on the aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit 
see table below for a summary of the pricing tiers for all applicable margin rates 
as of december   our applicable margin on our revolving credit facility and term loan facility was tier four and tier two  respectively 

table of contents revolving credit facility consolidated pricing leverage commitment letter of eurodollar base rate tier ratio fee credit fee loans loans but but but term loan facility consolidated pricing leverage eurodollar base rate tier ratio loans loans the term loan facility matures on october  and the revolving loan facility matures on october  we are required to make quarterly principal amortization payments of approximately million on the term loan facility 
such required quarterly principal payments were reduced from million after partially prepaying our term loan using proceeds from our initial public offering 
no principal payments are due on the revolving loan facility until the revolving facility maturity date 
we are also required to prepay our debt obligations based on an excess cash flow calculation for the applicable fiscal year which is determined in accordance with the terms of our credit agreement 
in may  we entered into the third amendment to our existing credit agreement in connection with the completion of the accuro acquisition 
the third amendment increased our term loan facility by million and the commitments to loan amounts under our revolving credit facility from million to million subsequently reduced by the lehman brothers bankruptcy as discussed below 
the third amendment also increased the applicable margins on the rate of interest we pay under our credit agreement 
as set forth above  the additional debt is subject to certain financial covenants of the original credit agreement 
with respect to our revolving credit facility  there are no provisions in the credit agreement that require us to maintain a lock box arrangement 
the third amendment became effective upon the closing of the accuro acquisition on june  we utilized cash on hand and approximately million of the increased borrowings to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of accuro 
in july  we entered into the fourth amendment to our existing credit agreement 
the fourth amendment increased the swing line loan sublimit from million to million 
the balance outstanding under our swing line loan is a component of the revolving credit commitments 
the total commitments under the credit facility  including the aggregate revolving credit commitments  were not increased as a result of the fourth amendment 
during september  a subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings  inc that had extended commitments of million under our revolving credit facility filed for bankruptcy 
this lender has not funded its ratable share of borrowing requests since this filing and we do not expect that this lender will fund its pro rata share of any future borrowing requests 
accordingly  until such time as these commitments are assigned to a substitute lender  the effective commitments outstanding under the revolver have declined by million to million 
however  we have not encountered  nor are we expecting to encounter  any other limitations from our lenders affecting our ability to draw requisite amounts of cash from our revolver to fund our operational cash flow requirements 

table of contents during september  we voluntarily changed our cash management practice to reduce our interest expense by instituting an auto borrowing plan with the agent under our credit agreement 
as a result  all of our excess cash on hand is voluntarily used to repay our swing line credit facility on a daily basis and we now fund our cash expenditures by using swing line loans 
as of december   we had a zero balance on our swing line loan and million was available under our revolving credit facility after giving effect to million of outstanding but undrawn letters of credit on such date and the effective commitments reduction resulting in the defaulting lender affiliated with lehman brothers 
we also had million outstanding of bank debt and a cash balance of million as of december  our credit agreement contains financial and other restrictive covenants  ratios and tests that limit our ability to incur additional debt and engage in other activities 
for example  our credit agreement includes covenants restricting  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens on assets  engage in certain lines of business  engage in mergers or consolidations  dispose of assets  make investments or acquisitions  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  enter into negative pledges or pay dividends or make other restricted payments 
our credit agreement also includes financial covenants including requirements that we maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio of to and a minimum consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio of to as of december  the consolidated total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and the consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio thresholds adjust in future periods 
the following table shows our future covenant thresholds covenant required ratios consolidated consolidated fixed leverage charge period ratio coverage october  through september  october  through september  october  through maturity the components that comprise the calculation of the aforementioned covenants are specifically defined in our credit agreement and require us to make certain adjustments to derive the amounts used in the calculation of each ratio 
based on our analysis as of december   our consolidated total debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio  calculated in accordance with the credit agreement  was approximately to and our consolidated fixed charges coverage ratio was approximately to  both of which are in compliance with the requirements of our credit agreement 
refer to the table in the earlier part of this section for a summary of the pricing tiers and the applicable rates 
the determination of our pricing tier is based on the consolidated leverage ratio that was calculated in the most recent compliance certificate received by our administrative agent which would have been for the nine month reporting period ended september  in addition  our loans and other obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed  subject to specified limitations  by our present and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 
as of december   we were not in default of any restrictive or financial covenants or ratios under our credit agreement

acquisition contingent consideration 
on may   the woodmoor group  inc woodmoor filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association against accuro  alleging that woodmoor is due a performance payment amount pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement the apa dated as of march  between woodmoor  as seller  and accuro  as buyer 
woodmoor claimed that it suffered actual damages in excess of million as a result of accuro s allegedly negligent or fraudulent actions in the performance of its obligations under the apa 
accuro and medassets denied the allegations 
on january   the arbitrator issued a summary judgment in favor of accuro 
two of our prior acquisitions med data and d i have provisions in the respective asset purchase agreements requiring additional consideration to be paid to the former owners of the acquired assets if certain performance criteria are met 
the med data contingency period ended june   and on september   we provided notice to the former owner of the med data business indicating that we do not believe any additional payment is due 
the former owner has disputed our calculation of the performance measures  alleged that we failed to fulfill our contractual obligations with respect to the earn out  and filed a complaint in federal court with respect to these matters on november  on march   we filed an answer  denying the plaintiffs allegations  and also filed a counterclaim  alleging that the plaintiffs fraudulently induced us to enter into the purchase agreement by intentionally concealing the true status of their relationship with their largest customer 
discovery has been substantially completed  but we cannot estimate a probable outcome of the litigation at this time 
the maximum potential earn out payment is million 
in addition  the plaintiffs claim that ms 
hodges  one of the plaintiffs  is entitled to the accelerated vesting of options to purchase  shares of our common stock that she received in connection with her employment agreement with the company 
the d i acquisition contingency period ended on december  and no additional consideration was earned under the terms of the agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we have provided a million letter of credit to guarantee our performance under the terms of a ten year lease agreement 
the letter of credit is associated with the capital lease of a building under a finance obligation 
we do not believe that this letter of credit will be drawn 
due to the accuro acquisition  we increased the amount of office space and equipment under operating leases 
some of these operating leases include rent escalations  rent holidays  and rent concessions and incentives 
however  we recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term utilizing total future minimum lease payments 
our consolidated future minimum rental payments under our operating leases with initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms of at least one year  including those acquired from accuro  are as follows as of december  for each respective year amount in thousands thereafter 
table of contents in february  we extended the lease for a subsidiary office building in bridgeton  missouri through june  the anticipated total commitment under this lease is million  including million in  million in the to period  and million in the to period 
in july  we extended the term of our lease on our offices in alpharetta  georgia 
the term of the lease was extended for an additional months commencing on april  and terminating on march  the incremental rental commitment under the lease is approximately million 
in july  we entered into a new lease on additional office space in order to acquire additional space totaling  square feet 
the term of the expansion space is for months commencing on january  and terminating on march  the total rental commitment under the lease is approximately million

other than the additional indebtedness  the deferred purchase consideration committed for the acquisition of accuro and any potentially related purchase price adjustments  as previously disclosed  and the additional lease commitments above  there are no material changes outside the ordinary course of business with respect to our contractual obligations

use of non gaap financial measures in order to provide investors with greater insight  promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management and the board of directors in its financial and operational decision making  we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis in this annual report on form k with the following non gaap financial measures gross fees  revenue share obligation  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin and revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue 
these non gaap financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
we compensate for such limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only supplementally 
we provide reconciliations of non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures  where possible 
investors are encouraged to carefully review those reconciliations 
in addition  because these non gaap measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  these measures  as defined by us  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
gross fees and revenue share obligation 
gross fees include all administrative fees we receive pursuant to our vendor contracts and all other fees we receive from customers 
our revenue share obligation represents the portion of the administrative fees we are contractually obligated to share with certain of our gpo customers 
total net revenue a gaap measure reflects our gross fees net of our revenue share obligation 
these non gaap measures assist management and the board of directors and may be helpful to investors in analyzing our growth in the spend management segment given that administrative fees constitute 
table of contents a material portion of our revenue and are paid to us by over  vendors contracted by our gpo  and that our revenue share obligation constitutes a significant outlay to certain of our gpo customers 
a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measure can be found in the overview section of item ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 
we define i ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization  ii adjusted ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization and other non recurring  non cash or non operating items  and iii adjusted ebitda margin  as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue 
we use ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than gaap measures alone 
these measures assist management and the board of directors and may be useful to investors in comparing our operating performance consistently over time as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges and amortization of debt issuance costs  asset base primarily depreciation and amortization and items outside the control of the management team taxes  as well as other non cash purchase accounting adjustments  and imputed rental income and non recurring items  from the our operational results 
adjusted ebitda also removes the impact of non cash share based compensation expense 
our board of directors and management also use these measures as i one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating  on at least a quarterly and annual basis  actual results against such expectations  and  ii as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive compensation programs  as well as for incentive compensation plans for employees generally 
additionally  research analysts  investment bankers and lenders may use these measures to assess our operating performance 
for example  our credit agreement requires delivery of compliance reports certifying compliance with financial covenants certain of which are  in part  based on an adjusted ebitda measurement that is similar to the adjusted ebitda measurement reviewed by our management and our board of directors 
the principal difference is that the measurement of adjusted ebitda considered by our lenders under our credit agreement allows for certain adjustments eg  inclusion of interest income  franchise taxes and other non cash expenses  offset by the deduction of our capitalized lease payments for one of our office leases that result in a higher adjusted ebitda than the adjusted ebitda measure reviewed by our board of directors and management and disclosed in this annual report on form k 
our credit agreement also contains provisions that utilize other measures  such as excess cash flow  to measure liquidity 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and are not alternatives to cash flow from continuing operating activities 
despite the advantages regarding the use and analysis of these measures as mentioned above  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin  as disclosed in this annual report on form k  have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap  nor are these measures intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for our discretionary use 
some of the limitations of ebitda are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our credit agreement  ebitda does not reflect income tax payments we are required to make  and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 

table of contents adjusted ebitda has all the inherent limitations of ebitda 
to properly and prudently evaluate our business  we encourage you to review the gaap financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
we also strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition  because adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the adjusted ebitda measure  as presented in this annual report on form k  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income  a comparable gaap based measure 
all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to ebitda to adjusted ebitda are either i non cash items eg  depreciation and amortization  impairment of intangibles and share based compensation expense or ii items that management does not consider in assessing our on going operating performance eg  income taxes and interest expense 
in the case of the non cash items  management believes that investors can better assess our comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges and more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance 
in the case of the other non recurring items  management believes that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 
fiscal year ended december  in thousands net income depreciation amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles included in cost of revenue interest expense  net of interest income income tax benefit ebitda impairment of intangibles share based compensation expense debt issuance cost extinguishment rental income from capitalizing building lease litigation expenses accuro  xactimed avega purchase accounting adjustments interest rate swap cancellation failed acquisition charges adjusted ebitda interest income is included in other income expense and is not netted against interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
impairment of intangibles during the fiscal year ended december  primarily relates to acquired developed technology from prior acquisitions  revenue cycle management tradename and internally developed software products  mainly due to the integration of accuro s operations and products 
impairment of intangibles during fiscal year ended december  and represents the write off of in process research and development from the xactimed acquisition in may and avega in  respectively 
represents non cash share based compensation to both employees and directors 
the significant increase in is due to share based grants made subsequent to our initial public offering 
the significant increase in is due to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we believe excluding this non cash expense allows us to compare our operating performance without regard to the impact of share based compensation expense  which varies from period to period based on the amount and timing of grants 

table of contents these charges were incurred to expense unamortized debt issuance costs upon refinancing our credit facilities 
we believe this expense relating to our financing and investing activities does not relate to our continuing operating performance 
the imputed rental income recognized with respect to a capitalized building lease is deducted from net income loss due to its non cash nature 
we believe this income is not a useful measure of continuing operating performance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this rental income 
these legal expenses related to litigation that was brought against one of our subsidiaries and settled in may this litigation  and associated litigation expense  is considered by management to be non recurring as it relates to isolated litigation outside the ordinary course of business 
these adjustments include the effect on revenue of adjusting acquired deferred revenue balances  net of any reduction in associated deferred costs  to fair value as of the respective acquisition dates for accuro  xactimed and avega 
the reduction of the deferred revenue balances materially affects period to period financial performance comparability and revenue and earnings growth in future periods subsequent to the acquisition and is not indicative of changes in underlying results of operations 
during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded an expense associated with the cancellation of our interest rate swap arrangements 
in connection with the cancellation  we paid the counterparty million in termination fees 
we believe such expense is infrequent in nature and is not indicative of continuing operating performance 
these charges reflect due diligence and acquisition expenses related to an acquisition that did not occur 
we consider these charges to be non recurring expenses that are not representative to underlying results of operations 
revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue 
revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue includes the revenue of certain acquired companies prior to our actual ownership 
the xactimed  md x and accuro acquisitions were consummated on may   july  and june   respectively 
this measure assumes the xactimed and md x acquisitions  inclusive of certain purchase accounting adjustments  had occurred on january   and the acquisition of accuro occurred on january of each of and revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue is used by management and the board of directors to better understand the extent of period over period growth of the revenue cycle management segment and the company as a whole 
given the significant impact that these acquisitions had on the company during the fiscal years ended december  and  we believe such acquisition affected net revenue may be useful and meaningful to investors in their analysis of such growth 
revenue cycle management acquisition affected net revenue is presented for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of what our results of operations would have been if these transactions had occurred at the beginning of such periods 
this measure also should not be considered representative of our future results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
certain of our contracts are denominated in canadian dollars 
as our canadian sales have not historically been significant to our operations  we do not believe that changes in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar will have a significant impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as we continue to grow our operations  we may increase the amount of our sales to foreign customers 
although we do not expect foreign currency exchange risk to have a significant impact on our future operations  we will assess the risk on a case specific basis to determine whether a forward currency hedge instrument would be warranted 
on august   we entered into a series of forward contracts to fix the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rates on a canadian customer contract  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements herein 
other than another canadian dollar contract that we have not elected to hedge  we currently do not transact business in any currency other than the us dollar 
we considered the credit worthiness of the counterparty of the hedge instruments 
given the current situation in the credit markets and specific challenges related to financial institutions  the company continues to believe that the underlying size  international presence and us government cash infusion  and track record of the counterparty will allow them to perform under the obligations of the contract and are not a risk of default that would change the highly effective status of the hedged instruments 
interest rate risk 
we had outstanding borrowings on our term loan and revolving credit facility of million as of december  the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin 
we entered into an interest rate collar in june which effectively sets a maximum libor interest rate of and a minimum libor interest rate of on the interest rate we pay on million of our term loan debt outstanding  effectively limiting our base interest rate exposure on this portion of our term loan debt to within that range to 
the collar does not hedge the applicable margin that the counterparty charges and on our revolving credit facility base rate loan and term loan  respectively  as of december  
settlement payments are made between the hedge counterparty and us on a quarterly basis  coinciding with our term loan installment payment dates  for any rate 
table of contents overage on the maximum rate and any rate deficiency on the minimum rate on the notional amount outstanding 
the collar terminates on september  and no consideration was exchanged with the counterparty to enter into the hedging arrangement 
as of december   we pay an effective interest rate of on million of notional term loan debt outstanding before applying the applicable margin 
we considered the credit worthiness of the counterparty of the hedge instrument when assessing effectiveness 
the company believes that given the size of the hedged instrument and the likelihood that the counterparty would have to perform under the contract ie libor goes above mitigates any potential credit risk and risk of non performance under the contract 
in addition  the company understands the counterparty has been acquired by a much larger financial institution 
we believe that the creditworthiness of buyer mitigates risk and will allow the counterparty to be able to perform under the terms of the contract 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in libor would have resulted in an approximate million change to our interest expense for the fiscal year ended december   which represents potential interest rate change exposure on our outstanding unhedged portion of our term loan and revolving credit facility
