critical accounting policies and estimates our financial condition and results of operations are based upon certain critical accounting policies  which include estimates  assumptions  and judgments on the part of management 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
investments we account for investments in securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
sfas requires the classification of investments in debt and equity securities with readily determinable fair values as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 

table of contents we invest our excess cash primarily in debt instruments of high quality corporate and government issuers 
all highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments 
all instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are considered long term investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating cycle 
such securities are classified as short term investments 
these securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measures 
changes in value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature 
except for declines in fair value that are not considered temporary  net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported as a component of accumulated comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method 
fair value of financial instrument on january   we adopted sfas which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
our estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in sfas the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates in the fas hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  default rates  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 
revenue recognition our online search advertising revenue is primarily composed of per click fees that we charge customers 
the per click fee charged for keyword targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content  up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer 
revenue also includes revenue share from licensing of private labeled versions of our products 
revenues associated with online advertising products  including advertiser networks  are generally recognized once collectability is established  delivery of services has occurred  all performance obligations have been satisfied  and no refund obligations exist 
we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners 
these payments are called traffic acquisition costs tac and are included in cost of revenues 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners 
this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service 

table of contents we also enter into agreements to provide private labeled versions of our products  including licenses to the adcenter 
these license arrangements include multiple elements revenue sharing based on the publisher s customer s monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application  upfront fees  and other license fees 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance  other license fees over the term of the license  and revenue sharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds 
the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends 
deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements 
customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments 
this valuation allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis to determine whether an additional provision or reversal is required 
the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables and whether economic conditions are more or less favorable than we anticipated 
we will record a reduction of our allowance for doubtful accounts if there is a significant improvement in collection rates or economic conditions are more favorable than we anticipated 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than we anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as bankruptcy 
management s judgment is required in the periodic review of whether a provision or reversal is warranted 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions 
management exercises judgment in the assessment of the related useful lives  fair value and recoverability of these assets 
the majority of intangible assets are amortized over three to seven years  the period of expected benefit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is december of each year 
in addition  we periodically re assess the valuation and asset lives of intangible assets with definite lives to conform to changes in management s estimates of future performance 
the provisions of sfas require that a two step test be performed to assess goodwill for impairment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires a determination of whether the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
the second step is performed only if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the second step involves an analysis reflecting the allocation of fair value determined in the first step as if it was the purchase price in a business combination 
this process may result in the determination of a new amount of goodwill 
if the calculated fair value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit  the difference is reflected as a non cash impairment loss 
the purpose of the second step is only to determine the amount of goodwill that should be recorded on the balance sheet 
the 
table of contents recorded amounts of other items on the balance sheet are not adjusted 
management has determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill testing 
we estimate the fair value of our single reporting unit utilizing up to three valuation methods market capitalization  income approach and market approach 
revenue and expense forecasts used in the evaluation of goodwill are based on trends of historical performance and management s estimate of future performance 
as of december   as a result of completing the annual goodwill impairment test with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist  we concluded that the carrying value of our single reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
due to the fact that sfas required us to allocate significant value to previously unrecognized identifiable assets  there remained no fair value to allocate to goodwill  resulting in an impairment of the entire remaining goodwill balance of million 
sfas also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas we amortize acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods from two to seven years and the amortization expense is primarily classified as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded impairment charges in income loss from discontinued operations in both and as a result of the write down of the wisenut and furl assets 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations and dispositions  for further details 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
due to our history of losses and the uncertainty of net operating loss utilization  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
fin effective january  in accordance with the provisions of fin  we record liabilities  where appropriate  for all uncertain income tax positions 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense 
internal use software development costs we account for internal use software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
in accordance with the capitalization criteria of sop  we have capitalized external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal use computer software and the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to developing internal use computer software 
management s judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
we expect to continue to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize costs in accordance with sop restructuring charges we have recorded restructuring accruals related to closing of certain leased facilities as well as severance costs related to workforce reductions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with 
table of contents exit or disposal of activities 
management s judgment is required when estimating when the redundant facilities will be subleased and at what rate they will be subleased 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation costs in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for share based compensation 
sfas r requires all share based payment transactions with employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net income loss 
we use the black scholes method of valuation for share based awards granted 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r

impairment charges in accordance with sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicates that the carrying value of our single reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is december of each year 
prior to our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december   we considered whether to test goodwill in the third quarter of although our stock price declined during this timeframe  we viewed this to be primarily indicative of the extreme volatility in the united states and global equity markets and believed the decline to be short term in nature 
additionally  our net book value exceeded our market capitalization as of september  therefore  management concluded that as of september  there were not events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value 

table of contents in december  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on our single reporting unit with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
we used the two step test required by sfas the first step of the goodwill impairment test consisted of comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
we estimated the fair value of the company using various methods and compared the fair value to the carrying amount net book value to ascertain if a potential goodwill impairment existed 
we utilized methods that focused on our ability to produce income the income approach and the estimated consideration we would receive if there were a sale of the company the market approach 
consideration was given to our discounted projected cash flows  our market capitalization and market multiples of comparable companies within our industry 
the key assumptions utilized in the determination of fair value in step one of the test included the following management s operating projections for through including revenues  operating margins  working capital investments and capital expenditures based on our historical results and expectations 
the cash flows utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimated using a weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the appropriate wacc was determined by calculating a wacc based upon publicly traded companies comparable to looksmart 
total enterprise value tev multiples of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business to ours were applied to our operating results to determine market approach fair value 
the per share price of our common stock and our overall market capitalization  including a control premium  was also considered in the fair value analysis 
based on the fair value estimated in step one  we determined a step one failure occurred which indicated a goodwill impairment may exist 
we proceeded to the step two analysis which included estimating the fair value of our assets and liabilities  including previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the income approach was utilized to value our identified intangible assets  including existing technology  in process research and development technology  customer relationships and the looksmart trade name 
as a result of step two of the test  the carrying value of our goodwill was deemed to exceed the allocated fair value and we recorded a million goodwill impairment for which represented the entire remaining goodwill balance 
we also tested our long lived assets for impairment as of december  we determined that no impairment existed for assets held and used as of december  however  a million impairment existed for the furl assets held for sale and is included in loss from discontinued operations for intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and is assessed for impairment under sfas sfas requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets if the net book value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributed to such assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset for assets to be held and used  or the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value less the cost to dispose for assets to be disposed 
fair market value is determined using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
loss from operations in thousands year ended december  of revenue of revenue dollar change change loss from operations our loss from operations for the year ended december  was million  an increase from a loss of million for the year ended december  loss from operations increased million due to the factors discussed above that include a goodwill impairment of million partially offset by million of increased gross profit and million of lower operating expenses excluding the goodwill impairment

interest expense  primarily consisting of interest paid on capital leases and our note payable  increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase is primarily driven by our increased use of capital leases in to finance asset additions 
income tax expense due to our operating losses  the income tax expense primarily consists of minimum state taxes 
in  we allocated an income tax benefit to continuing operations 
pursuant to sfas  paragraph  the income from discontinued operations is considered when determining the amount of tax benefit that results from  and should be allocated to  a loss from continuing operations 
the income from discontinued operations represents a source of income that enables us to realize a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations 
as a result  we have allocated an income tax benefit to the loss from continuing operations based on the tax rate applicable to discontinued operations

see footnote to the consolidated financial statements  fair value of financial instruments  which describes further the composition of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments

we cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution

the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  we maintain directors and officers insurance coverage that may contribute  up to certain limits  a portion of any future amounts paid for indemnification of directors and officers 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
historically  we have not incurred any losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under these types of indemnities 
additionally  in the normal course of business  we have made certain guarantees  indemnities and commitments under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  municipalities in the us  time deposits  money market mutual funds and corporate securities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our income from investments may decrease in the future 
we considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of basis points could be experienced in the near term 
a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities that is not significant at december
