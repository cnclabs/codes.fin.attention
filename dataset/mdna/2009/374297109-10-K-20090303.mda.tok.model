item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general developments related to marketing and the marketing leases 
if we are not in compliance with one or more of our covenants which  if not complied with could result in an event of default under our credit agreement  there can be no assurance that our lenders would waive such non compliance 
a default under our credit agreement  if not cured or waived  whether due to a loss of our reit status  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or prospects  a failure to comply with financial and certain other covenants in the credit agreement or otherwise  could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness under our credit agreement 
this could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  ability to pay dividends and or stock price 
the downturn in the credit markets has increased the cost of borrowing and has made financing difficult to obtain  which may negatively impact our business  and may have a material adverse effect on us 
lenders may require us to enter into more restrictive covenants relating to our operations during  the united states housing and residential lending markets began to experience accelerating default rates  declining real estate values and increasing backlog of housing supply 
the residential sector issues quickly spread more broadly into the corporate  asset backed and other credit and equity markets and the volatility and risk premiums in most credit and equity markets have increased dramatically  while liquidity has decreased 
these issues have continued into and the beginning of increasing concerns regarding the united states and world economic outlook  such as large asset write downs at banks  volatility in oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment and bankruptcy filings  are compounding these issues and risk premiums in most capital markets remain near historical all time highs 
these factors are precipitating generalized credit market dislocations and a significant contraction in available credit 
as a result  it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain cost effective debt capital to finance new investment activity or to refinance maturing debt  and most lenders are imposing more stringent restrictions on the terms of credit 
any future credit agreements or loan documents we execute may contain additional or more restrictive covenants 
the negative impact on the tightening of the credit markets and continuing credit and liquidity concerns may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  ability to pay dividends and or stock price 
additionally  there is no assurance that the increased financing costs  financing with increasingly restrictive terms or the increase in risk premiums that are demanded by investors will not have a material adverse effect on us 
our business operations may not generate sufficient cash for distributions or debt service 
there is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock  to pay our indebtedness  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may not be able to repay or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms  which could force us to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which may also result in losses or accept financing on unfavorable terms 
borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at a floating rate 
accordingly  an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest we must pay under our credit agreement and a significant increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult to find alternative financing on desirable terms 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution with respect to a portion of our variable rate debt outstanding under our credit agreement 
although the agreement is intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates  it also exposes us to the risk that the other party to the agreement will not perform  the agreement will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as a highly effective cash flow hedge for accounting purposes 
further  there can be no assurance that the use of an interest rate swap will always be to our benefit 
while the use of an interest rate swap agreement is intended to lessen the adverse impact of rising interest rates  it also conversely limits the positive impact that could be realized from falling interest rates with respect to the portion of our variable rate debt covered by the interest rate swap agreement 
we may be unable to pay dividends and our equity may not appreciate 
under the maryland general corporation law  our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if  after payment of the dividend  we would not be able to pay indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if we were to be dissolved  to satisfy the rights of any shareholders with liquidation preferences 
there currently are no shareholders with liquidation preferences 
no assurance can be given that our financial performance in the future will permit our payment of any dividends 
for additional information regarding developments related to marketing and the marketing leases  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general developments related to marketing and the marketing leases 
in particular  our credit agreement prohibits the payments of dividends during certain events of default 
as a result of the factors described above  we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect our business  stock price and ability to pay dividends 
the loss of certain members of our management team could adversely affect our business 
we depend upon the skills and experience of our executive officers 
loss of the services of any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  ability to pay dividends and or stock price 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executives 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations  and they require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial position and results of operations 
we have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the estimates  judgments and assumptions associated with these critical accounting policies  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not make subsequent significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements including those included in this form k 
estimates  judgments and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements include  but are not limited to  deferred rent receivable  recoveries from state ust funds  environmental remediation costs  real estate  depreciation and amortization  impairment of long lived assets  litigation  accrued expenses  income taxes payable and the allocation of the purchase price of properties acquired to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for example  we have made judgments regarding the level of environmental reserves and reserves for our deferred rent receivable relating to marketing and the marketing leases 
these judgments and assumptions may prove to be incorrect and our business  financial condition  revenues  operating expense  results of operations  liquidity  ability to pay dividends and or stock price may be materially adversely affected if that is the case 
for information regarding our critical accounting policies  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues  profitability or financial position 
our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
the application of gaap is also subject to varying interpretations over time 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb and the sec 
those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues  profitability or financial position 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our results of operations 
terrorist attacks or armed conflicts could affect our business or the businesses of our tenants or of marketing or its parent 
the consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
terrorist attacks also could be a factor resulting in  or a continuation of  an economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  ability to pay dividends and or stock price 
item b 
unresolved staff comments one comment remains unresolved as part of a periodic review commenced in by the division of corporation finance of the sec of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  pertaining to the sec s position that we must include the financial statements and summarized financial data of marketing in our periodic filings  which marketing contends is prohibited under the terms of the master lease 
in june  the sec indicated that  unless we file marketing s financial statements and summarized financial data with our periodic reports i it will not consider our annual reports on forms k for the years beginning with to be compliant  ii it will not consider us to be current in our reporting requirements  iii it will not be in a position to declare effective any registration statements we may file for public offerings of our securities  and iv we should consider how the sec s conclusion impacts our ability to make offers and sales of our securities under existing registration statements and if we have a liability for such offers and sales made pursuant to registration statements that did not contain the financial statements of marketing 
we believe that the sec s position is based on their interpretation of certain provisions of their internal financial reporting manual formerly known as their accounting disclosure rules and practices training material  staff accounting bulletin no 
and rule of regulation s x 
we do not believe that any of this guidance is clearly applicable to our particular circumstances and we believe that  even if it were  we should be entitled to certain relief from compliance with such requirements 
marketing generally subleases our properties to independent  individual service station convenience store operators subtenants 
consequently  we believe that we  as the owner of these properties and the getty brand  could re let these properties to the existing subtenants except for those properties that are vacant who operate their convenience stores  automotive repair services or other businesses at our properties  or to other new or replacement tenants  at market rents although we cannot accurately predict whether  when  or on what terms  such properties would be re let or sold 
the sec did not accept our positions regarding the inclusion of marketing s financial statements in our filings 
we have had no communication with the sec since regarding the unresolved comment 
we cannot accurately predict the consequences if we are unable to resolve this outstanding comment 
we do not believe that offers or sales of our securities made pursuant to existing registration statements that did not or do not contain the financial statements of marketing constitute  by reason of such omission  a violation of the securities act of  as amended  or the exchange act 
additionally  we believe that if there ultimately is a determination that such offers or sales  by reason of such omission  resulted in a violation of those securities laws  we would not have any material liability as a consequence of any such determination 
item properties nearly all of our properties are leased or sublet to distributors and retailers engaged in the sale of gasoline and other motor fuel products  convenience store products and automotive repair services who are responsible for the payment of taxes  maintenance  repair  insurance and other operating expenses and for managing the actual operations conducted at these properties 
approximately twenty of our properties are directly leased by us to others under similar lease terms primarily for other uses such as fast food restaurants  automobile sales and other retail purposes 
in those instances where we determine that the highest and best use for our properties is no longer a retail motor fuel outlet  we will seek alternative tenants or buyers for such properties as opportunities arise 
the following table summarizes the geographic distribution of our properties at december  the table also identifies the number and location of properties we lease from third parties and which marketing leases from us under the marketing leases 
in addition  we lease four thousand square feet of office space at jericho turnpike  jericho  new york  which is used for our corporate headquarters  which we believe will remain suitable and adequate for such purposes for the immediate future

the following table sets forth information regarding lease expirations  including renewal and extension option terms  for properties that we lease from third parties calendar year number of leases expiring percent of total leased properties percent of total properties subtotal thereafter total we have rights of first refusal to purchase or lease one hundred forty four of the properties we lease 
although there can be no assurance regarding any particular property  historically we generally have been successful in renewing or entering into new leases when lease terms expire 
approximately of our leased properties are subject to automatic renewal or extension options 
in the opinion of our management  our owned and leased properties are adequately covered by casualty and liability insurance 
in addition  we require our tenants to provide insurance for all properties they lease from us  including casualty  liability  fire and extended coverage in amounts and on other terms satisfactory to us 
we have no plans for material improvements to any of our properties 
however  our tenants frequently make improvements to the properties leased from us at their expense 
we are not aware of any material liens or encumbrances on any of our properties 
we lease eight hundred fifty five retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and nine petroleum distribution terminals to marketing under the marketing leases 
the master lease is a unitary lease and has an initial term expiring in  and generally provides marketing with three renewal options of ten years each and a final renewal option of three years and ten months extending to each of the renewal options may be exercised only on an all or nothing basis 
the marketing leases are triple net leases  under which marketing is responsible for the payment of taxes  maintenance  repair  insurance and other operating expenses 
as permitted under the terms of our leases with marketing  marketing can generally use each property for any lawful purpose  or for no purpose whatsoever 
we believe that as of december   marketing had vacancies and or removed the gasoline tanks and related equipment at what may be as much as or more of the properties subject to the marketing leases 
for additional information regarding developments related to marketing and the marketing leases  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general developments related to marketing and the marketing leases 
if marketing fails to pay rent  taxes or insurance premiums when due under the marketing leases and the failure is not cured by marketing within a specified time after receipt of notice  we have the right to terminate the marketing leases and to exercise other customary remedies against marketing 
if marketing fails to comply with any other obligation under the master lease after notice and opportunity to cure  we do not have the right to terminate the master lease 
in the event of marketing s default where we do not have the right to terminate the master lease  our available remedies under the master lease are to seek to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief requiring marketing to comply with its obligations under the master lease and to recover damages from marketing resulting from the failure 
if any lease we have with a third party landlord for properties that we lease to marketing is terminated as a result of our default and the default is not caused by marketing  we have agreed to indemnify marketing for its losses with respect to the termination 
marketing has the right of first refusal to purchase any property leased to marketing under the marketing leases that we decide to sell 
we have also agreed to provide limited environmental indemnification to marketing  capped at million and expiring in  for certain pre existing conditions at six of the terminals we own and lease to marketing 
under the agreement  marketing is obligated to pay the first million of costs and expenses incurred in connection with remediating any pre existing terminal condition  marketing will share equally with us the next million of those costs and expenses and marketing is obligated to pay all additional costs and expenses over million 
we have accrued million as of december  and in connection with this indemnification agreement 
under the master lease  we continue to have additional ongoing environmental remediation obligations for one hundred eighty seven scheduled sites and our agreements with marketing provide that marketing otherwise remains liable for all environmental matters

matters related to our newark  new jersey terminal and the lower passaic river in september  we received a directive the directive issued by the njdep under the new jersey spill compensation and control act 
the directive indicated that we are one of approximately sixty six potentially responsible parties for alleged nrds resulting from discharges of hazardous substances along the lower passaic river the lower passaic river 
the directive alleged  inter alia  that the recipients thereof must conduct an assessment of the natural resources that have been injured by the discharges and implement interim compensatory restoration for the injured natural resources 
njdep alleges that our liability arises from alleged discharges originating from our newark  new jersey terminal site 
chevron texaco was also identified in the directive 
we responded to the directive by asserting that we were not liable 
there has been no material activity and or communications by njdep with respect to the directive since early after its issuance 
effective june   the united states environmental protection agency epa entered into an administrative order on consent aoc with parties some of which are also named in the directive who agreed to fund a portion of the costs for epa to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study ri fs for the lower passaic river 
the ri fs is intended to address the investigation and evaluation of alternative remedial actions with respect to alleged damages to the lower passaic river 
after being notified by the epa that they considered us to be a potentially responsible party  we reserved our defenses to liability  became a party to an amended aoc  and joined the cooperating parties group cpg  which consists of the parties which had executed the initial aoc and other parties including chevron texaco 
pursuant to the amended aoc and subsequent amendments adding additional parties  the cpg has agreed to take over performance of the ri fs from epa 
the ri fs does not resolve liability issues for remedial work or restoration of  or compensation for  natural resource damages to the lower passaic river  which are not known at this time 
as to such matters  separate proceedings or activities are currently ongoing 
in a related action  in december  the state of new jersey brought suit in the superior court of new jersey  law division  against certain companies which the state alleges are responsible for pollution of the passaic river from a former diamond alkali manufacturing plant and seeking recovery of alleged damages incurred and to be incurred on account of alleged discharges of hazardous substances to the passaic river

in response  chevron texaco has asserted that the proceedings and claims are still not yet developed enough to determine the extent to which indemnities apply 
our ultimate liability  if any  in the pending and possible future proceedings pertaining to the lower passaic river is uncertain and subject to numerous contingencies which cannot be predicted and the outcome of which are not yet known

prior to our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under the federal income tax laws in income taxes have not had a significant impact on our earnings since we first elected to be treated as a reit 
d in addition to measurements defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  our management also focuses on funds from operations ffo and adjusted funds from operations affo to measure our performance 
ffo is generally considered to be an appropriate supplemental non gaap measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts reits 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net earnings before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  gains or losses on dispositions of real estate  including such non ffo items reported in discontinued operations  extraordinary items  and cumulative effect of accounting change 
other reits may use definitions of ffo and or affo that are different than ours and  accordingly  may not be comparable 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors in measuring our performance because ffo excludes various items included in gaap net earnings that do not relate to  or are not indicative of  our fundamental operating performance such as gains or losses from property dispositions and depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 
in our case  however  gaap net earnings and ffo include the significant impact of deferred rental revenue straight line rental revenue and the net amortization of above market and below market leases on our recognition of revenue from rental properties  as offset by the impact of related collection reserves 
deferred rental revenue results primarily from fixed rental increases scheduled under certain leases with our tenants 
in accordance with gaap  the aggregate minimum rent due over the current term of these leases is recognized on a straight line basis rather than when the payment is due 
the present value of the difference between the fair market rent and the contractual rent for in place leases at the time properties are acquired is amortized into revenue from rental properties over the remaining lives of the in place leases 
gaap net earnings and ffo also include income tax benefits recognized due to the elimination of  or reduction in  amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions related to being taxed as a c corp 
rather than as a reit prior to see note b above 
as a result  management pays particular attention to affo  a supplemental non gaap performance measure that we define as ffo less straight line rental revenue  net amortization of above market and below market leases and income tax benefit 
in management s view  affo provides a more accurate depiction than ffo of the impact of the scheduled rent increases under these leases  rental revenue from acquired in place leases and our election to be treated as a reit under the federal income tax laws beginning in neither ffo nor affo represent cash generated from operating activities calculated in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative for gaap net earnings or as a measure of liquidity
