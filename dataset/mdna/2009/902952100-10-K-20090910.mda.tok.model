item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated results of operations for the past three fiscal years and other factors that may affect future financial performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data 
recent trends and continuing disruptions in worldwide financial markets due to the consequences of the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market beginning in  the worldwide financial markets have encountered intense volatility due to uncertainty and disruption within the credit markets 
this disruption continued into and causing global equities to decline worldwide 
the company s investment advisory fees and operating revenue primarily depend on the value of its assets under management  and continued global market fluctuations impact the funds asset levels  thereby affecting income and results of operations 
this global strain has resulted in a seizing of the international credit markets resulting in unprecedented worldwide governmental actions 
for instance  on september   the us government moved to guarantee the outstanding debt of fannie mae and freddie mac 
on september   the us treasury department announced a temporary guarantee program for publicly available money market funds which elected to participate in the program 
furthermore  on october   the us congress enacted the emergency economic stabilization act of  which sanctioned the treasury secretary to create the troubled assets relief program and authorize the purchase of up to billion of troubled assets 
despite these aggressive governmental programs and actions  the global financial markets continue to remain extremely volatile 
what began as the sub prime mortgage default concern has swelled to practically every aspect of the global financial marketplace 
since late  the markets continue to experience uncertainty and disruption resulting in the sharp decline in equity markets and dislocation in the credit markets 
the equity markets suffered from pullback in consumer spending  which led to weak performance in the global markets  increased unemployment  and significant declines in the values of assets owned by financial institutions 
this worldwide disruption has spread to tangential areas including currencies and commodities  which directly impact the company and the assets it manages 
the sustained volatility throughout the financial world continued throughout the company s fiscal year 
returns on many major equity indices have significantly declined from june   which had a dramatic effect on assets under management and revenues 
total assets under management at june   were billion versus billion at june  business segments us global  with principal operations located in san antonio  texas  manages two business segments 
first  the company offers a broad range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors  and second  the company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position 
for more details on the results of our core operations  see note financial information by business segment 
the company generates substantially all its operating revenues from the investment management of products and services for usgif and two offshore clients 
although the company generates the majority of its revenues from its investment advisory segment  the company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments 
as of june   the company held approximately million in investments  of which approximately million  or of total assets  was invested in 
table of contents the funds and other offshore clients and million  or of total assets  in other entities 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s two business segments 
investment management products and services investment management revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under management 
fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the funds asset levels  thereby affecting income and results of operations 
during fiscal year  average assets under management decreased to billion  primarily due to significant decreases in the natural resource and foreign equity funds under management through both net outflows and market depreciation 
average assets under management dollars in millions change change natural resource international equity fixed income domestic equity total sec registered funds other advisory clients average assets under management investment activities management believes it can more effectively manage the company s cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the company 
the following summarizes the market value  cost and unrealized gain or loss on investments as of june   and june  unrealized holding gains losses on unrealized available for sale securities market value cost gain loss securities  net of tax trading    n a available for sale total at june  trading    n a available for sale total at june  unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the statement of operations 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and recorded in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
as of june   and  the company held approximately million and million  respectively  in investments other than the clients the company advises 

table of contents investments in securities classified as trading are reflected as current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair market value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
investments in securities classified as available for sale  which may not be readily marketable  are reflected as non current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
investment income loss from the company s investments includes realized gains and losses on sales of securities  unrealized gains and losses on trading securities  realized foreign currency gains and losses  other than temporary impairments on available for sale securities  and dividend and interest income 
investment income can be volatile and may vary depending on market fluctuations  the company s ability to participate in investment opportunities  and timing of transactions 
a significant portion of the unrealized gains and losses is concentrated in a small number of issuers 
for fiscal years   and  the company had net realized gains losses of approximately   and  respectively 
due to market volatility  the company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future 

table of contents consolidated results of operations the following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the company and a detailed discussion of the company s revenues and expenses 
change change net income loss in thousands net income loss per share basic diluted weighted average shares outstanding in thousands basic diluted for the year ended june   no options were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would be antidilutive due to the net loss 
year ended june   compared with year ended june  the company posted net after tax loss of  loss per share for the year ended june   compared with net after tax income of  per share for the year ended june  this decrease in profitability is primarily attributable to the following factors revenues total consolidated revenues for the year ended june   decreased  or  compared with the year ended june  this decrease was primarily attributable to the following investment advisory fees declined by million primarily as a result of decreased assets under management in the natural resources and international equity funds 
investment income decreased by million primarily as a result of declines in the market value of trading securities in the natural resources and international equity sectors as well as an other than temporary impairment as a result of declines in the market value of available for sale securities 
expenses total consolidated expenses for the year ended june   decreased by  or  compared with the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the following subadvisory fees decreased by  or million  due to a change in the subadvisory contract discussed in note significant accounting policies revenue recognition as well as decreased assets in the funds being subadvised  platform fees decreased by  or million  due to decreased asset inflows through broker dealer platforms and decrease in asset values due to market declines  employee compensation expense decreased by  or million  primarily due to a decline in incentive bonuses and fewer employees  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  primarily due to proxy related costs associated with the merger of the usgif and usgaf trusts 

table of contents year ended june   compared with year ended june  the company posted net after tax income of  per share for the year ended june   compared with net after tax income of  per share for the year ended june  the decrease in profitability in fiscal year primarily resulted from a decrease of million in advisory fees  an increase of million in platform fee expense  and an increase of million in employee compensation and benefits 
these factors were somewhat offset by an increase of  in transfer agent fees and a decrease of  in general and administrative expenses 
revenues dollars in thousands change change investment advisory fees natural resource funds international equity funds domestic equity funds fixed income funds total mutual fund advisory fees other advisory fees total investment advisory fees transfer agent fees distribution fees administrative service fees investment income loss other revenues total investment advisory fees 
investment advisory fees  the largest component of the company s revenues  are derived from two sources sec registered mutual fund advisory fees  which in fiscal accounted for of the company s total advisory fees  and offshore investment advisory fees  which accounted for of total advisory fees 
sec registered mutual fund investment advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of average net assets  ranging from to  and are paid monthly 
these advisory fees decreased by approximately million  or  in fiscal over fiscal primarily as a result of decreased assets under management  particularly in the international equity and natural resource funds 
mutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management  which include market appreciation or depreciation  the addition of new client accounts  client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures  and the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed 
a special meeting of shareholders of usgif and usgaf was held on september   to consider several proposals 
the proposals were approved effective october   and included i a reorganization of the usgif and usgaf funds from two separate massachusetts business trusts into a single delaware statutory trust under the name usgif  ii a new advisory agreement for the usgif funds and iii a new distribution plan for the nine equity usgif funds under which usgb is paid a fee at an annual rate of percent of the average daily net assets of each fund 
with respect to four equity funds  the new advisory agreement also increased the base advisory fee and changed to the advisory fee breakpoints 
in addition  administrative services that were part of the previous advisory 
table of contents agreement were removed and became the subject of a separate agreement 
under the new administrative services agreement  the funds no longer reimburse the company for certain legal and administrative services  but instead pay the company compensation at an annual rate of percent of the average daily net assets of each fund for administrative services provided by the company to usgif 
a full discussion of the proposals is set forth in proxy materials filed with the sec by usgif and usgaf 
the company incurred a total of million in merger related costs  of which million was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal as of october   the nine equity usgif funds include a base advisory fee that  beginning in october  will be adjusted upwards or downwards by percent if there is a performance difference of percent or more between a fund s performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior rolling months 
prior to october   the company voluntarily waived or reduced its advisory fees and or agreed to pay expenses on seven of thirteen funds 
effective october   the company contractually agreed to cap the expenses of all thirteen funds through september  thereafter  these caps will continue on a modified and voluntary basis at the discretion of the company 
the aggregate fees waived and expenses borne by the company were   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the above waived fees include amounts waived under an agreement whereby the company has voluntarily agreed to waive fees and or reimburse the us treasury securities cash fund and the us government securities savings fund to the extent necessary to maintain the respective fund s yield at a certain level as determined by the company minimum yield 
reflecting increased demand in the market for government securities  yields on such products have decreased to record lows 
in certain products  the gross yield is not sufficient to cover all of the funds normal operating expenses and fee waivers have been used to maintain positive or zero net yields 
for the fiscal year ended june   fees waived and or expenses reimbursed as a result of this agreement were  and  for the us treasury securities cash fund and the us government securities savings fund  respectively 
the company may recapture any fees waived and or expenses reimbursed within three years after the end of the fund s fiscal year of such waiver and or reimbursement to the extent that such recapture would not cause the fund s yield to fall below the minimum yield 
thus   of these waivers are recoverable by the company through december  and  through december  management believes these waivers could increase in the future 
such increases in fee waivers could be significant and will negatively impact the company s revenues and net income 
management cannot predict the impact of the waivers due to the number of variables and the range of potential outcomes 
the company expects to continue to waive fees and or pay for fund expenses if market and economic conditions warrant 
however  subject to the company s commitment to certain funds with respect to fee waivers and expense limitations  the company may reduce the amount of fund expenses it is bearing 
on november   effective immediately  the company terminated its relationship with endeavour financial corp 
efc as the subadviser to its equity portfolio 
as investment adviser  the company was paid a monthly advisory fee based on the net asset value of the portfolio and an annual performance fee  if any  based on a percentage of consolidated net income from operations in excess of a predetermined percentage return on equity 
the company recorded advisory fees from efc totaling   and  for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company continues to provide advisory services for two offshore clients and receives monthly advisory fees based on the net asset values of the clients and performance fees  if any  based on the overall increase in net asset values 
the company recorded fees from these clients totaling   and  for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
the performance fees for these clients are calculated and recorded quarterly in accordance with the terms of the advisory agreements 
these fees may fluctuate significantly from year to year based on factors that may be out

risk factors and the section entitled revenue recognition under critical accounting policies 
frank holmes  ceo  serves as a director of the offshore clients 
the company receives additional revenue from several sources including custodial fee revenues  revenues from mailroom operations  and investment income 
transfer agent fees 
united shareholder services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  provides transfer agency and mailing services for company clients 
the company receives an annual fee per account as well as transaction and activity based fees as compensation for services rendered as transfer agent  and is reimbursed for out of pocket expenses associated with processing shareholder information 
in addition  the company collects custodial fees on iras and other types of retirement plans invested in usgif 
transfer agent fees are  therefore  significantly affected by the number of client accounts 
transfer agent fees decreased by million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a decline in the number of shareholder accounts and number of transactions 
the increase in transfer agent fees in fiscal years and was primarily a result of an increase in the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts due to improved performance of the natural resource and international equity funds and the result of the revised fee structure effective april   which incorporated transaction and activity based fees 
distribution fees 
as noted above  a new distribution plan was approved effective october   for the nine equity usgif funds under which usgb is paid a fee at an annual rate of percent of the average daily net assets of each fund 
administrative service fees 
as noted above  effective october   administrative services that were part of the pervious advisory agreement were removed and became the subject of a separate agreement 
under the new administrative services agreement  the funds no longer reimburse the company for certain legal and administrative services  but instead pay the company compensation at an annual rate of percent of the average daily net assets of each fund for administrative services provided by the company to the funds 
investment income 
investment income loss from the company s investments includes realized gains and losses on sales of securities  unrealized gains and losses on trading securities  realized foreign currency gains and losses  other than temporary impairments on available for sale securities  and dividend and interest income 
this source of revenue is dependent on market fluctuations and does not remain at a consistent level 
timing of transactions and the company s ability to participate in investment opportunities largely affect this source of revenue 
investment income decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease can be attributable primarily to declines in the market value of trading securities in the natural resources and international equity sectors as well as an other than temporary impairment as a result of declines in the market value of available for sale securities 
of the million decrease in fiscal  million related to decrease in investment income in investments in the funds and the offshore clients 
investment income increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was attributed primarily to increases in unrealized gains on corporate investments 
included in investment income were other than temporary impairments of  for the fiscal year ending  there were no other than temporary impairments for the fiscal years ending and 
table of contents expenses dollars in thousands change change employee compensation and benefits general and administrative platform fees subadvisory fees advertising depreciation total employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits decreased by million  or  in and increased by million  or  in fiscal the decrease in was primarily due to decrease in incentive bonuses and fewer employees 
the increase in was primarily due to incentive bonuses associated with strong mutual fund performance  mutual fund asset growth  strong offshore advisory client performance and increased shareholder accounts 
subadvisory fees 
subadvisory fees are calculated as a percentage of average net assets of the two funds that are subadvised by a third party manager 
the decrease in subadvisory fees of million in fiscal year is due to the restructured responsibilities of the third party manager 
effective november   the company assumed the day to day management of both funds and the subadvisory fees were reduced 
the increases in subadvisory fees of million in fiscal year resulted primarily from growth in assets in the eastern european fund 
the subadvisory agreement related to the global megatrends fund was terminated effective september  general and administrative 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million  or  in fiscal year resulted primarily from proxy related costs associated with the merger of the usgif and usgaf trusts 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million  or  in fiscal year resulted primarily from decreased consulting and legal fees 
platform fees 
broker dealers typically charge an asset based fee for assets held in their platforms 
the decrease in platform fee expenses in fiscal year of million  or  was due to the decrease in assets held in the broker dealer platforms 
net platform fee expenses increased by million during fiscal year due to an increase in assets held in the broker dealer platforms during the fiscal year 
the incremental assets received through the broker dealer platforms are not as profitable as those received from direct shareholder accounts due to margin compression resulting from paying platform fees on those assets 
advertising 
advertising expense was essentially flat in fiscal compared to and fiscal year compared to fiscal depreciation 
depreciation expense was essentially flat in fiscal compared to fiscal depreciation expense increased by  in fiscal year as a result of a slight increase in capital purchases 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return

contractual obligations include agreements to fund educational programs  as well as services used in daily operations 
other contractual obligations not included in this table consist of subadvisory contracts and agreements to waive or reduce fees and or pay expenses on several funds 
future obligations under these agreements are dependent upon future levels of fund assets 
the board has authorized a monthly dividend of per share through december  at which time it will be considered for continuation by the board 
payment of cash dividends is within the discretion of the company s board of directors and is dependent on earnings  operations  capital requirements  general financial condition of the company  and general business conditions 
the total amount of cash dividends to be paid to class a and class c shareholders from july to september will be approximately  liquidity and capital resources at fiscal year end  the company had net working capital current assets minus current liabilities of approximately million and a current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities of to with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current obligations 
total shareholders equity was approximately million  with cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities comprising of total assets 
the company has no long term debt  thus  the company s only material commitment going forward is for operating expenses 
the company also has access to a million credit facility  which can be utilized for working capital purposes 
the company s available working capital and potential cash flow are expected to be sufficient to cover current expenses 
the investment advisory and related contracts between the company and usgif will expire on september  with respect to offshore advisory clients  the contracts between the company and the clients expire periodically and management anticipates that its offshore clients will renew the contracts 
management believes current cash reserves  financing obtained and or available  and potential cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs or capital necessary for the above mentioned activities and allow the company to take advantage of investment opportunities whenever available 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
management reviews these estimates on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the 
table of contents circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company believes the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to valuation of security investments  income taxes  valuation of stock based compensation  revenue recognition on advisory contracts  related party transactions and recent accounting pronouncements 
security investments 
the company accounts for its investments in securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company classifies its investments in equity and debt securities based on intent 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each reporting period date 
securities that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in earnings 
investments in debt securities or mortgage backed securities that are purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost 
the company currently has no investments in debt securities or mortgage backed securities 
investments classified as neither trading securities nor held to maturity securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these available for sale securities are excluded from earnings  reported net of tax as a separate component of shareholders equity  and recorded in earnings when realized 
the company evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
for available for sale securities with declines in value deemed other than temporary  the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income 
the company records security transactions on trade date 
realized gains or losses from security transactions are calculated on the first in first out cost basis  unless otherwise identifiable  and are recorded in earnings on the date of sale 
securities traded on a securities exchange are valued at the last sale price 
securities for which over the counter market quotations are available  but for which there was no trade on or near the balance sheet date  are valued at the mean price between the last price bid and last price asked 
securities for which quotations are not readily available are valued at management s estimate of fair value 
income taxes 
the company s annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in its us and us entities which are part of the company s consolidated financial statements  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated income statement 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s consolidated tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises also create a difference between the tax rate used in the consolidated tax return and the effective tax rate in our consolidated income statement 

table of contents the company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
judgment is used to identify  recognize  and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
a liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return 
these liabilities are adjusted  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
judgment is used in classifying unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits will generally be classified as a noncurrent liability because there will usually be a period of several years between the filing of the tax return and the final resolution of an uncertain tax position with the taxing authority 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which reserves have been established are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
we measured the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal and on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
no options were granted in we believe that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition on offshore advisory contracts 
during fiscal  the company provided investment advisory services to three offshore clients 
the advisory contracts of two of the three clients provided for monthly payment of management fees and quarterly payment of performance fees  if any  by the client and were recorded accordingly 
the contract of one of the three offshore clients  efc  which terminated on november   called for monthly payment of management fees and annual  rather than quarterly  payment of performance fees by the client 
however  under gaap  the company could have chosen to record performance fees either annually or more frequently 
management chose the more conservative method method  in which performance fees were recorded annually as was provided by the contract terms 
under method  incentive fees could have been recorded periodically and calculated as the amount that would be due under the formula at any point in time as if the contract were terminated at that date

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that required or permitted fair value measurements because the fasb had previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that the fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued staff position fsp to defer the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a non recurring basis 
management adopted the provisions of sfas related to all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis on july  the adoption of sfas did not affect the company s financial position or results of operations  but did result in additional required disclosures  which are provided in note investments

sfas allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the amendment to sfas applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
once the election is made for the instrument  all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument must be reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not elected to apply the provisions of sfas to any of our financial instruments  therefore  the adoption of sfas effective july   has not affected our financial position or results of operations

 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards eitf 
under the provisions of eitf  a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and are paid to employees for equity classified nonvested equity shares  nonvested equity share units  and outstanding equity share options should be recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the amount recognized in additional paid in capital for the realized income tax benefit from dividends on those awards should be included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies on share based payment awards 
eitf should be applied prospectively to the income tax benefits that result from dividends on equity classified employee share based payment awards that are declared in fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years
