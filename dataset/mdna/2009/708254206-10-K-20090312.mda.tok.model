in addition  pennichuck water owns four impounding dams which are situated on the nashua and merrimack border 
the primary source of potable water for our core pennichuck water system is the pennichuck brook  holt pond  bowers pond  harris pond and supply pond in the nashua area that together can hold up to million gallons of water 
we supplement that source during the summer months by pumping water from the nearby merrimack river 
pennichuck water can deliver up to million gallons per day mgd  into the distribution system 
by comparison  pennichuck water had an average daily demand of mgd during its peak month  which occurred in june

the plant has a rated capacity of mgd 
we own a raw water intake and pumping facility located on the merrimack river in merrimack  new hampshire 
this supplemental water supply provides an additional source of water during summer periods and will provide a long term supply for pennichuck water s service area 
a permit from the army corps of engineers that has been extended through december  allows us to divert water from the merrimack river 
we may divert between and mgd dependent upon the river elevation and flow

pennichuck east has entered into long term water supply agreements to obtain water from manchester water works and hudson 
we have an agreement with the town of hudson  which expires in  that allows us to pump up to  gallons per day from its wells at a cost equal to the variable cost of production or operation associated with the system as a whole or any of its components 
hudson will charge us a higher rate for water pumped in excess of the  gallons allowed per day 
pittsfield aqueduct s source of water supply for the town of pittsfield new hampshire is berry pond  which holds approximately million gallons

furthermore  pittsfield aqueduct is revising its request for permanent rate relief  as described below 
any difference between the temporary rate relief that has been granted and the permanent rates ultimately approved by the nhpuc for these utilities will be reconciled upon the approval of such permanent rates 
the company is continuing to pursue the current pennichuck water rate case despite the july order from the nhpuc that  subject to certain conditions  the taking of the operating assets of pennichuck water by the city of nashua is in the public interest and that the price to be paid for such assets is million determined as of december  the eminent domain order

table of contents pennichuck water s treatment plant in nashua is subject to the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule  which established a turbidity standard of nephelometric turbidity units or ntu 
turbidity is a measure of sediment or foreign particles that are suspended in the water 
pennichuck water completed its evaluation of alternatives to meet the new turbidity standard in  resulting in its recommendations for upgrades to its existing treatment facilities  beginning with its raw water facilities through its finished water pumping and storage facilities 
this work was divided among six distinct construction contracts  with contracts and involving upgrades to pennichuck water s raw water facilities being completed in upgrades to pennichuck water s finished water pumpage and storage facilities contracts and were completed in january the design of the proposed upgrades to the existing coagulation  flocculation  sedimentation  filtration and chemical feed facilities contract was completed in april and construction on these upgrades began in june of with completion expected in early non regulated water management services we complement our regulated water utility business by providing contract operation and maintenance services  including monitoring water quality  testing  maintenance and compliance reporting services for water systems for various towns  businesses and residential communities primarily in southern and central new hampshire

ongoing eminent domain proceeding overview the city of nashua the city is engaged in an ongoing effort that began in to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck water s assets through an eminent domain proceeding under new hampshire revised statutes annotated chapter the nhpuc conducted a hearing on the merits of the city s proposed eminent domain taking of the assets of pennichuck water  which hearing was completed on september  on july   the nhpuc issued its order in this matter  ruling that a taking of the assets of pennichuck water is in the public interest provided certain conditions are met  and provided that the city pay to pennichuck water million for such assets determined as of december  the conditions include a requirement that nashua pay an additional million into a mitigation fund to protect the interests of the customers of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
based on advice of counsel  we believe that the nhpuc s order contains a number of significant legal errors that undermine its validity with respect to whether or not such eminent domain taking is in the public interest and regarding the price to be paid by the city for such taking 
we also believe that an outcome based on the july order is not in the best interests of the company s shareholders 
both the company and the city have filed motions for rehearing or reconsideration before the nhpuc 
the company has also stated that  if necessary  it will consider filing an appeal to the new hampshire supreme court 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company has stated publicly that it remains open to engaging in settlement discussions with the city aimed at resolving this dispute outside of eminent domain 
toward that end  the company announced on february  that it had engaged the investment banking firm of boenning scattergood  inc of west conshohocken  pennsylvania to advise it regarding possible settlement with the city 
a settlement could involve nashua s acquisition of some or all of the assets of pennichuck or one or more of its subsidiaries or  alternatively  the shares of pennichuck stock 
we remain vehemently opposed to the city s proposed eminent domain taking of pennichuck water assets 

table of contents new hampshire law does not require that our board of directors or shareholders ratify or approve a forced sale of assets by eminent domain or the amount of compensation that pennichuck water would receive if the city ultimately successfully completes its proposed eminent domain taking of the assets of pennichuck water 
nashua s initiation of eminent domain proceedings pennichuck entered into an agreement in april to be acquired in a merger with aqua america  inc formerly philadelphia suburban corporation 
the merger was subject to several conditions  including approval by our shareholders and approval by the nhpuc 
in february  before we submitted the merger to our shareholders  we and aqua america agreed to abandon the proposed transaction because of actions taken by the city to acquire our assets by eminent domain 
the city s mayor at that time stated his opposition to our proposed merger with aqua america after we announced it 
in november  the nashua board of aldermen adopted a formal resolution to hold a city wide referendum to approve the initiation of an eminent domain proceeding or other acquisition of all or a portion of pennichuck water s system serving the residents of the city and others 
in january  nashua residents approved the referendum 
in november  the city made a proposal to purchase all of the company s assets for a purchase price of million 
the offer was subject to various conditions  including the city s completion of a municipal bond offering to fund the purchase price 
the city claimed that its proposal exceeded by million the approximate value that our shareholders would have received under the proposed aqua america merger measured at the time that transaction was first announced 
the city asserted that the difference would offset the corporate level income taxes that the company would incur in a sale of assets to the city 
in december  our board of directors unanimously rejected the city s proposal 
at that time  we publicly stated that our board had concluded that the city s proposal was inadequate and not in the best interests of our shareholders  significantly underestimated the value of our assets and failed to recognize both the underlying value of our shares and the potential tax liabilities that would result from the proposed transaction 
we also stated that we believed that the city s proposal failed to make allowances for assuming our long term debt and other liabilities 
in march  as part of the eminent domain process  the city filed a petition with the nhpuc seeking approval to acquire all of our water utility assets  whether or not related to our nashua service area 
the nhpuc ruled in january that the city could not use the eminent domain procedure to acquire any of the assets of pennichuck east or pittsfield aqueduct  and that  with regard to the assets of pennichuck water  the question of which assets  if any  could be taken by the city was dependent on a determination to be made after a hearing as to what was in the public interest 

table of contents uncertainty regarding compensation to pennichuck water as previously stated  on july   the nhpuc issued its order that the taking of the assets of pennichuck water is in the public interest provided certain conditions are met  and provided that the city pays million to pennichuck water for such assets determined as of december  the conditions include a requirement that the city pay an additional million into a mitigation fund to protect the interests of the customers of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
another condition is that the city submit to the nhpuc  for its advance approval  the final operating contracts between the city and its planned contractors 
the remaining conditions cover various aspects of the operation and oversight of the water system under city ownership 
under new hampshire law  all parties to the proceeding and persons directly affected by the order had days to seek reconsideration or a rehearing before the nhpuc 
our company and the city of nashua were the only parties to submit such motions or objections thereto 
the nhpuc s ruling on any request for reconsideration or a rehearing may be appealed to the new hampshire supreme court  and the company has stated that  if necessary  it may do so 
we cannot predict when the nhpuc will rule on the pending motions from the city and our company  but we expect that a full rehearing and appeal process could take a year or more 
we have publicly stated our willingness to consider any comprehensive settlement proposals the city may wish to make to us 
we remain opposed to the city s proposed eminent domain taking of pennichuck water assets 
considering the rehearing motions that have been filed and despite the compensation determination in the july nhpuc order  it is difficult to predict the amount of compensation the city would have to pay to pennichuck water in the event of a taking of its assets by eminent domain 
in the company s motion for reconsideration and or rehearing filed with the nhpuc on august   the company identified errors that we believe require rehearing  a number of which relate to valuation 
for example  one matter with regard to which we believe the nhpuc erred relates to the nhpuc s decision to exclude from its asset and income approach valuation analysis a long term growth factor in the applicable capitalization rates  the effect of which was to understate the value by approximately million 
conversely  in its rehearing motion filed with the nhpuc on august   the city argued that the majority opinion of the nhpuc erred in setting the value of pennichuck water assets at million and that  instead  the million valuation supported by the dissenting commissioner should have been adopted by the majority 
further information regarding the eminent domain order and the rehearing motions is contained in pennichuck s current report on form q dated november  filed with the sec 
right to appeal pennichuck water and the city as well as any party to the proceedings or any person directly affected thereby has a right to appeal directly to the new hampshire supreme court any order issued by the nhpuc in an eminent domain proceeding 
however  the supreme court will overturn an order by the nhpuc only if it is demonstrated that the nhpuc has made an error of law or  by a clear preponderance of the evidence  that a factual or policy determination by the nhpuc is contrary to law  unjust or unreasonable 
the new hampshire supreme court applies a presumption of reasonableness to factual determinations by the nhpuc 

table of contents certain tax considerations if the city acquires for cash in an eminent domain proceeding any of pennichuck water s assets  pennichuck water would be taxed as if it had willingly sold those assets to the city 
unless we are able to utilize a special non recognition income tax provision discussed below  we would recognize gain for federal income tax purposes at the corporate level equal to the excess of the aggregate value pennichuck water receives for each asset minus the adjusted tax basis of those assets 
the aggregate adjusted tax basis of pennichuck water s assets is significantly less than the aggregate adjusted book value of those assets as reflected in our consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
the difference exists primarily because the rate at which we depreciate pennichuck water assets for federal income tax purposes is greater than the depreciation rate that we use for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  an asset valuation by the nhpuc equal to or greater than adjusted book value would likely require pennichuck water to recognize from such sale a taxable gain and resultant income tax liability that would likely be material in amount 
if  for example  we then distributed the remaining cash proceeds from such sale and from the sale of the company s remaining assets to our shareholders in liquidation of the company  another tax would be triggered at the shareholder level if and to the extent the amount of cash distributed exceeds the shareholder s cost basis in the shares being redeemed 
it may be possible for pennichuck water to defer the recognition of gain for tax purposes on a forced sale of assets if within a certain time period it reinvests the amount received from the sale in property that is similar or related in service or use to the property acquired by the city 
the rules for replacing real property under these circumstances are less stringent than the rules for replacing personal property 
to the extent that some of the assets subject to sale are determined under state and local law to be personal property and not real property  pennichuck water will be more limited in its options for locating suitable replacement property for these assets and  thus  less likely to defer any potential tax at the corporate level 
notwithstanding the foregoing  there can be no assurance that pennichuck water would be successful in deferring the recognition of any or all of the taxable gain by reinvesting the proceeds in like kind property  especially considering the risks associated with finding suitable property proximate to the company s current location and the magnitude of the amounts that would have to be reinvested 
this description of certain tax consequences of an eminent domain taking by the city does not purport to constitute tax advice to any holder of our common stock 
each shareholder is urged to consult his  her or its own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences of an eminent domain taking to the holder  including the application and effect of foreign  state and local income and other tax laws 
city may not proceed with acquisition in an eminent domain scenario  the city would not be bound to proceed with the acquisition until ratified by a vote of two thirds of the nashua board of aldermen 
in addition  we expect that the city would need to incur debt financing to fund the purchase 
consequently  even if the nhpuc order withstands rehearing and appeal  there is no assurance that the city will proceed with the acquisition 

table of contents our opposition to a forced sale of assets we have vigorously opposed the city s efforts to force pennichuck water to sell its assets to the city through the eminent domain proceeding  and we intend to continue to do so 
an important distinction between a forced sale of assets through an eminent domain proceeding and a negotiated acquisition of pennichuck assets or stock that might result from a comprehensive settlement is that  in the former circumstance  after we have exhausted our legal challenges to a forced sale of assets in an eminent domain proceeding and to the amount of damages that the city would have to pay to us as a consequence of such a taking  neither our board of directors nor our shareholders would have any right to approve the taking 
our eminent domain related expenses have been significant  as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and could continue to be significant depending on the outcome of the nhpuc rehearing motion and other factors 
town of pittsfield eminent domain actions the town of pittsfield voted at its town meeting to acquire the assets of our pittsfield aqueduct subsidiary by eminent domain 
in april  the town notified us in writing of the town s desire to acquire the assets 
we responded that we did not wish to sell the assets 
thereafter  no further action was taken by the town until march  when the town again voted to take the assets of our pittsfield aqueduct subsidiary and also to appropriate  for the eminent domain process 
on march   we received a letter from the town reiterating the town s desire to acquire the assets of our pittsfield aqueduct subsidiary 
we do not have a basis to evaluate whether the town will actively pursue the acquisition of our pittsfield aqueduct assets by eminent domain  but since the date of the town s letter to us  the town has taken no further legal steps required to pursue eminent domain under new hampshire rsa chapter town of bedford eminent domain actions the town of bedford voted at its town meeting in march to take by eminent domain the company s assets within bedford for purposes of establishing a water utility  and by letter dated april  inquired whether the company  and any relevant wholly owned subsidiary of the company  was then willing to sell said assets to bedford 
the company responded by letter dated june   informing the town that the company does not wish to sell those assets located in bedford that are owned by any of its subsidiaries 
the company has not received a response to its letter  and since the date of the town s letter to us  the town has taken no further legal steps required to pursue eminent domain under new hampshire rsa chapter during the hearing regarding the proposed eminent domain taking by nashua  the witness for the town of bedford testified that the town s interest in a possible taking of assets of the company related to a situation in which nashua might acquire less than all of the company s assets  leaving the system in bedford as part of a significantly smaller utility

risk factors there are various risks involved in investing in our company  some of which are described below 
investors should carefully consider each of the following factors and all of the other information in this annual report on form k  including information that is incorporated in this annual report on form k by reference 

table of contents risks related to our water utilities the city of nashua s use of the power of eminent domain to acquire a significant portion of our water utility assets creates uncertainty and may result in material adverse consequences for us and our shareholders 
we are involved in ongoing proceedings with the city of nashua the city regarding the city s desire to acquire all or a significant portion of the water utility assets of pennichuck water  our principal subsidiary 
the city is pursuing such acquisition pursuant to its power of eminent domain under new hampshire law 
on july   the nhpuc issued an order that the taking of the assets of pennichuck water is in the public interest provided certain conditions are met  and that the price to be paid to pennichuck water for such assets is million determined as of december  the conditions include a requirement that the city place an additional million into a mitigation fund to protect the interests of the customers of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
another condition is that the city submit to the nhpuc  for its advance approval  the final operating contracts between the city and its planned contractors 
the remaining conditions cover various aspects of the operation and oversight of the water system under city ownership 
a taking of assets by eminent domain as per the nhpuc order would result in a significant taxable gain and related income tax liability based on the difference between the price paid to pennichuck water for the assets taken and pennichuck water s underlying cost or tax basis in such assets 
the tax liability would be due currently unless the proceeds of the taking were reinvested in other water utility assets in accordance with certain provisions of the internal revenue code 
for a further discussion  see note  commitments and contingencies in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
under new hampshire law  all parties to the proceeding and persons directly affected by the order had days to seek reconsideration or a rehearing before the nhpuc 
our company and the city were the only parties to submit such motions or objections thereto 
the nhpuc s ruling on any request for reconsideration or a rehearing may be appealed to the new hampshire supreme court 
we cannot predict when the nhpuc will rule on the pending motions from the city and our company  but we expect that a full rehearing and appeal process would likely take a year or more 
if the city ultimately is successful in obtaining a final determination that it can take some or all of pennichuck water s assets  the city is not required under nhrsa ch 
to complete the taking and could choose not to proceed with the purchase of the assets 
our board of directors and our shareholders would not have the right to approve a forced sale of pennichuck water assets to the city in an eminent domain proceeding or the amount of damages that the city would have to pay to pennichuck water as a consequence of such a taking 
furthermore  such compensation could give rise to material income tax liabilities at the corporate level  thereby effectively reducing our remaining net assets 
given the highly integrated nature of our businesses  a forced sale of a significant portion of pennichuck water s assets may result in increased costs and operating inefficiencies borne by our remaining water utilities 
additionally  service corporation s ability to service its existing contracts  as well as pursue additional operating contracts  could be materially impaired 
the existence of a pending eminent domain proceeding also could adversely affect our future prospects and result in the loss of key employees 

table of contents it is likely that our company would not have the opportunity to contract to operate for the city all or any portion of the pennichuck water system that the city could acquire in an eminent domain proceeding 
according to the city s filings with the nhpuc  if the city acquires all or any portion of the pennichuck water system in an eminent domain proceeding  the city intends to enter into an operation  maintenance and management agreement with veolia water north america northeast llc to operate that water system 
according to the city s filings  veolia is a wholly owned subsidiary of veolia environment a french company  formerly known as vivendi environment 
our vigorous opposition to the city s efforts to acquire our assets by eminent domain has had  and may continue to have  a material adverse effect on our operating results and has been  and may continue to be  a significant distraction to our management 
we have vigorously opposed the city s efforts to acquire pennichuck water s assets by eminent domain and intend to continue to do so 
our eminent domain related expenses have been significant until recently and these expenses will now likely increase substantially as a result of the july nhpuc order 
for  these expenses were approximately million  versus million in and million in each of and a substantial portion of our senior management s attention has been and will continue to be devoted to coordinating various aspects of our response to the city s eminent domain initiative 
we cannot assure you that management s attention to the city s eminent domain initiative will not adversely affect their oversight of other aspects of our business 
on february  we announced that we engaged an investment banking firm to advise us regarding a possible comprehensive settlement of the ongoing eminent domain dispute with the city of nashua  new hampshire 
a settlement could involve nashua s acquisition of some or all of the assets of pennichuck or one or more of its subsidiaries or  alternatively  the shares of pennichuck stock 
on november   the city of nashua announced that it was hiring an investment banking firm to assist it in exploring all possible ways that it might acquire pennichuck water works by means other than eminent domain

montopoli  pennichuck s president and chief executive  said  as previously publicly stated  we are open to engaging in settlement discussions with the city of nashua aimed at resolving our dispute outside of eminent domain 
nevertheless  i must caution pennichuck stakeholders that a comprehensive settlement would require the negotiation and resolution of many complex issues and  therefore  no assurance can be given that nashua and pennichuck would ultimately be able to reach a settlement agreement 
moreover  in addition to the approval of two thirds of nashua s board of aldermen  a definitive settlement agreement could also be subject to approval by the new hampshire public utilities commission and  depending on the terms of any settlement  pennichuck shareholders 
we have also previously disclosed that we generally do not intend to comment further on the status or substance of any settlement discussions with the city of nashua unless and until a definitive settlement agreement is entered into 

table of contents our liquidity may be reduced and our cost of debt financing may be increased while the eminent domain controversy remains unresolved  because  while such controversy is ongoing  we may be unable to  or elect not to  issue or remarket debt securities for which pennichuck may be liable 
given the highly uncertain ultimate outcome of the eminent domain proceeding  we may find that we are unable to  or elect not to  issue or remarket certain debt securities pending a definitive resolution of the city s eminent domain petition or we may find that the cost that we incur in connection with the issuance or remarketing of such debt increases materially 
if we are unable to  or elect not to  issue or remarket such debt  we would expect to rely primarily on our available cash and short term investment balances and  thereafter  on our bank revolving credit facility to finance our capital projects 
our borrowing costs under that credit facility would likely be materially higher than tax exempt bond financing costs 
borrowings under the credit facility would also reduce our liquidity to meet other obligations 
for additional information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
our water utility business requires significant capital expenditures and the rates we charge our customers are subject to regulation 
if we are unable to obtain government approval of our requests for rate relief  or if approved rate relief is untimely or inadequate to cover our investments  our operating results would suffer 
our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers 
these rates are subject to approval by the nhpuc 
we file rate relief requests  from time to time  to recover our operating expenses and to recover the cost of and earn a return on our investments in utility plant 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
we typically spend significant sums each year for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
once we file a rate relief petition with the nhpuc  the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
we can provide no assurances that any future rate relief request will be approved by the nhpuc  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that the rate relief granted will be in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought such rate relief 
the relatively large magnitude of rate relief that we have currently requested in order to obtain recovery of and a return on recent capital expenditures may adversely affect our ability to obtain timely and adequate rate relief and  therefore  could adversely affect our ability to service the debt that we have incurred 
during and  our capital expenditures were particularly large due to investments in those years to a complete major portions of the upgrade to our water treatment plant to meet more stringent federally mandated water quality standards  b complete various water distribution  storage  supply  maintenance  rehabilitation and replacement projects  and c implement a proposed radio based meter reading system 
as a result of the magnitude of our current construction program  our current rate relief requests are significant 
there can be no assurance that the nhpuc will approve these rate relief requests in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our investments to date and current expense levels 
our ability to service the debt that we have incurred to finance our construction program would be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain timely and adequate rate relief relating to the capital expenditures incurred to date 

table of contents our financial flexibility may be limited during the next several years  as our long term debt and our ratio of total debt to total capitalization has increased significantly as a consequence of our debt funding of our capital expenditures 
as of december   our total common equity and total debt were million and million  respectively  resulting in a total debt to total capitalization ratio of 
we project that toward the end of our projected capital expenditures program  our total debt net of mandatory and discretionary debt re financings and our total debt to total capitalization ratio net of cash balances  if any will increase further 
the increases in our total debt and in our ratio of total debt to total capitalization may limit our ability to fund our operations  to pay dividends on our common stock and to pursue acquisitions 
these increases may also limit our ability to renew or replace our maturing credit facilities or may otherwise adversely affect our access to long term debt at reasonable costs and terms 
changes in the us debt markets  including especially adverse changes to the municipal bond market in general and to the financial condition of our bond insurer  has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the interest expense we incur for certain tax exempt financings and in the future may require pennichuck to accept less advantageous terms and conditions on its tax exempt financings 
pennichuck water s tax exempt bonds are insured pursuant to bond insurance policies provided by american municipal bond assurance corporation ambac 
historically  utilizing ambac bond insurance has had the effect of achieving a moody s credit rating of aaa  resulting in a lower interest rate than would have been the case had pennichuck water borrowed on its stand alone moody s credit rating of baa historically  such interest rate savings were greater than the cost of bond insurance  resulting in lower net borrowing costs with bond insurance 
the major independent credit rating service providers ie  moody s  standard poor s and fitch investors service have conducted detailed reviews of the credit ratings of ambac and several other monoline bond insurers 
such reviews resulted in ambac s ratings having been downgraded 
currently  ambac s moody s rating is baa with a developing outlook and its rating from standard poor s rating services is a with a negative outlook 
these recent downgrades and the prospect of additional future downgrades may have the effect of diminishing  and in certain instances eliminating  the net benefit to borrowers  including the company  of utilizing ambac bond insurance 
on october  pennichuck water repurchased its million series b bonds rather that remarketing them and deposited them as treasury bonds with the escrow agent 
pennichuck water reached this decision in part because the interest rate that it would have had to pay on the series b bonds would likely have been significantly higher than the rates paid on similar pennichuck water bonds 
the increase in indicative rates for the series b bonds was due to a variety of factors  including ambac s downgraded ratings and the general credit market conditions at the time 
the company s decision to repurchase the series b bonds was also based in part on its liquidity at the time 
if  in the future  the company has less liquidity at the time of a tax exempt financing or remarketing and the offered interest rates on its bonds remain high or increase  including increases due to a future ambac downgrade  the company may be forced to accept interest rates on pennichuck water bonds that are higher than those previously available to it which could in turn have a material adverse effect on how and whether the company chooses to conduct tax exempt financings and remarketings in the future 

table of contents no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of the continuing credit reviews of ambac s credit ratings nor can any assurance be given as to the impact of such reviews on interest rates for new issues or remarketings of pennichuck water bonds that are insured by ambac 
furthermore  no assurance can be given as to the net benefit  if any  to pennichuck water of its utilization of ambac bond insurance 
in the absence of any net benefit  pennichuck water may seek alternate forms of third party credit enhancement for example  bank letters of credit or may seek to borrow on a stand alone basis 
no assurance can be given as to availability  terms and conditions and net benefit  if any  through the utilization of alternate third party credit enhancement 
furthermore  should pennichuck water seek to borrow on a stand alone basis  its cost of borrowing is likely to be higher than  and its borrowing terms and conditions are likely to be less flexible than  comparable results for borrowings supported by the aaa bond insurance policy anticipated at the october implementation of the tax exempt bond financing program for funding its water treatment plant upgrade project and other capital improvements 
we may not be able to maintain our existing indebtedness or to incur additional indebtedness under our existing long term and revolving debt facilities  if our future credit ratios do not satisfy the requirements under those facilities 
our ability to issue long term debt is subject to us satisfying certain financial ratios at the time of such borrowing ie  debt incurrence tests 
similarly  our ability to access funds under our revolving credit facility is subject to maintaining certain financial ratios ie  maintenance tests 
these ratios limit the amount of long term debt relative to net plant and the amount of total debt to total capitalization and also specify minimum amounts of earnings and cash flow available to pay interest and fixed charges as a percentage of such interest and fixed charge amounts 
we were in compliance with such tests as of december  our ability to incur significant additional long term debt and to continue to satisfy these tests depends  among other factors  on receipt of timely and adequate rate relief 
should we be unable to issue long term debt  to borrow under our revolving credit facility or otherwise to access traditional sources of funds at reasonable costs and terms  our ability to finance our future capital expenditures program on a timely basis could be materially impaired 
in such event  we may need to seek other forms of capital at less favorable costs and terms or defer or reduce some of our capital expenditures 
any delay in implementing or completing capital improvements could adversely affect our ability to request and receive rate relief from the nhpuc relating to capital expenditures incurred by us and could give rise to contractual penalties 
if we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents  our indebtedness could be accelerated and our operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due 
if  however  we do not generate sufficient cash  we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity  which may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default under these documents  which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness 

table of contents we expect that all or substantially all of our then outstanding indebtedness would be accelerated if the city were to acquire a significant portion of our assets  such acceleration could adversely affect our financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
an eminent domain taking or temporary use by any governmental body of all or substantially all of the tangible property of pennichuck water used or useful in its business as a water company would result in a mandatory redemption of our long term debt 
we expect that any taking of pennichuck water s assets by the city in the eminent domain matter now pending before the nhpuc or a bona fide sale in lieu of such taking has occurred would represent the taking of substantially all of pennichuck water s tangible property used or useful in its business as a water company and would therefore trigger mandatory redemption of our long term debt 
similarly  our revolving credit facility with bank of america provides that any indebtedness outstanding under the facility would be due upon the city acquiring all or a material portion of pennichuck water s assets in an eminent domain proceeding 
also  no new borrowings would be permitted under such facility 
such acceleration could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results if we are unable to repay such indebtedness at that time or to refinance the indebtedness on equally favorable terms and conditions or to incur new borrowings 
we may be restricted by one or more debt agreements from paying dividends in amounts similar to dividends that our company has paid in recent periods  or  in more unlikely circumstances  from continuing to pay any dividend 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or  if dividends are paid  that they will be in amounts similar to dividends that our company has paid in recent periods 
it is our current intention  however  to continue to pay comparable cash dividends in the future  subject to the terms of our company s debt agreements 
certain bond and note agreements as well as our revolving credit facility impose restrictions on the payment or declaration of dividends 
the loss of a significant commercial or industrial customer can and has adversely affected our operating results and cash flows 
our revenues will decrease  and such decrease may be material  if one or more significant commercial or industrial customers terminate  or materially reduce  their use of our water 
if any large commercial or industrial customer reduces or ceases its consumption of our water  we may seek nhpuc approval to increase the rates of our remaining customers to recover any lost revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that the nhpuc would approve such a rate relief request  and even if it did approve such a request  it would not apply retroactively to the date of the reduction in consumption 
the delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

table of contents we are subject to federal  state and local regulation that may impose significant limitations and restrictions on the way we do business 
various federal  state and local authorities regulate many aspects of our business 
among the most important of these regulations are those relating to the quality of water we supply our customers 
these laws require us to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations and to perform water quality tests that are monitored by the us environmental protection agency  or epa  and the new hampshire department of environmental services  or des  for the detection of certain chemicals and compounds in our water 
we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators for non compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
in addition  government authorities continually review these regulations  particularly the drinking water quality regulations and may propose new or more restrictive requirements in the future 
if new or more restrictive limitations on permissible levels of substances and contaminants in our water are imposed  we may not be able to adequately predict the costs necessary to meet regulatory standards 
if we are unable to recover the cost of implementing new water treatment procedures in response to more restrictive water quality regulations through the rates we charge our customers  or if we fail to comply with such regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water systems 
any pending or future acquisition we decide to undertake will involve risks 
the acquisition and integration of water systems is an important element in our growth strategy 
this strategy depends on identifying suitable acquisition opportunities and reaching mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to expend significant costs and resources 
further  acquisitions may result in dilution for the owners of our common stock  our incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and fluctuations in quarterly results 
in addition  the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the financial results that we expected 
the current concentration of our business in southern and central new hampshire makes us susceptible to any adverse development in local regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and weather conditions 
our core service area comprises pennichuck water s franchise in the city of nashua  new hampshire and portions of the surrounding towns of amherst  hollis and merrimack 
pennichuck east serves a similar area in southern and central new hampshire  east of the merrimack river and pennichuck water s core service area 
our revenues and operating results are therefore subject to local regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and weather conditions in these areas 
a change in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business 
in addition  any such change would have a disproportionate effect on us  compared to water utility companies that do not have such a geographic concentration 
weather conditions and overuse may interfere with our sources of water  demand for water services and our ability to supply water to our customers 
we depend primarily on surface water from the pennichuck brook and  to a lesser extent  the merrimack river in nashua  new hampshire to meet the present and future water demands of our customers 
unexpected conditions may interfere with our water supply sources 
drought and overuse may limit the availability of surface water 
these factors might adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
additionally  cool and wet weather  as well as drought restrictions and our customers conservation efforts  may reduce consumption demands  also adversely affecting our revenues and operating results 
furthermore  freezing weather may also contribute to water transmission interruptions caused by pipe and main breakage 
if we experience an interruption in our water supply  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents contamination of our water supply may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
our water supply is subject to contamination from the migration of naturally occurring substances in groundwater and surface systems  as well as pollution resulting from man made sources 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source through our interconnected transmission and distribution facilities 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods 
our inability to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective or timely manner  may have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
the necessity for increased security has and may continue to result in increased operating costs 
in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks and the ensuing attention to threats to the nation s health and security  we have expended resources to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also incurred expenses to tighten our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
we are not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies 
however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of such events should they occur 
damage to any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition  revenues  operating results and cash flows 
pennichuck water owns seven dams  including four impounding dams which are situated on the nashua and merrimack border 
a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and property damage downstream for which we may be liable and which may adversely affect our financial condition  revenues and operating results 
the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition  revenues  operating results and cash flows 
the success of our acquisition strategy depends significantly on the services of the members of our senior management team and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer 
the success of our acquisition strategy depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our senior management team 
if we lose the services of any member of our senior management or are unable to hire and retain experienced management personnel  it could harm our operating results 

table of contents risks related to our water management business our water management subsidiary s revenue growth depends on its ability to enter into new operating contracts and maintain its existing contracts with municipalities  communities and non transient  non community water systems 
in our target market of new hampshire and nearby portions of maine  massachusetts and vermont  municipalities and communities own and operate the majority of water systems 
a significant portion of service corporation s marketing and sales efforts is spent demonstrating the benefits of contract operations to elected officials and municipal authorities 
employee unions and certain public interest groups generally oppose the principle of outsourcing these services to companies like us and are active opponents in this process 
the political environment means that decisions are made based on many factors  not just economic factors 
there can be no assurance that we can maintain or expand our water management business 
our water management subsidiary s business depends on trained  qualified employees 
state regulations set the staff training  experience and staff qualification standards required for service corporation s employees to operate specific water facilities 
we must recruit  retain and develop qualified employees  maintain training programs and support employee advancement 
we must provide the proper management and operational staff of state certified and qualified employees to support the operation of water facilities 
failure to do so could put us at risk  among other things  for operational errors at the facilities  which could have an adverse effect on our water management business 
our water management subsidiary s business is subject to environmental and water quality risks 
clients of service corporation are owners of the facilities that we operate under contract 
the facilities must be operated in accordance with various federal and state water quality standards 
we also handle certain hazardous materials at these facilities  for example  sodium hydroxide 
any failure of our operation of the facilities  including noncompliance with water quality standards  hazardous material leaks and spills  and similar events  could expose us to environmental liabilities  claims and litigation costs 
there is no assurance that we will successfully manage these issues and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
risks related to our real estate activities the cost of obtaining development permits and other land use approvals  as well as fluctuations in interest rates  construction costs and economic conditions prevailing in the nashua merrimack area and the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets  could adversely affect the value of our undeveloped land 
primarily through our southwood subsidiary  we own or control several parcels of non utility undeveloped land in nashua and merrimack  new hampshire  comprising approximately acres 
during the next several years  if and to the extent that opportunities arise  we expect to pursue  directly or indirectly  the permitting and other land use approvals necessary to realize some or all of the value of those parcels 
we may undertake those efforts either alone or in concert with others 
the value we realize for our undeveloped land will depend primarily on whether development permits and other land use approvals can be obtained in a timely  cost effective manner 
the process of obtaining such permits and approvals is inherently uncertain  lengthy and expensive 
the value of our undeveloped land may also be affected by fluctuations in interest rates  construction costs and economic conditions prevailing in the nashua merrimack area and the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets 

table of contents other risks there is a limited trading market for our common stock  you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for them 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global market  the trading in our common stock has substantially less liquidity than many other companies quoted on the nasdaq global market 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
as a consequence of the limited volume of trading in our common stock  a sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the open market could cause our stock price to decline 
we are subject to anti takeover measures that may be used by existing management to discourage  delay or prevent changes of control that might benefit non management shareholders 
classified board of directors we have a classified board of directors  which means only one third of the directors are elected each year 
a classified board can make it harder for an acquirer to gain control by voting its candidates onto the board of directors and may also deter merger proposals and tender offers 
at least two annual meetings of shareholders  instead of one  will generally be required to effect a change in a majority of the board 
authorized shares our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock 
the shares of common stock and preferred stock were authorized in an amount greater than intended to be issued to provide our board of directors with as much flexibility as possible to effect  among other transactions  financings  acquisitions  stock dividends  stock splits and employee stock option grants 
however  these additional authorized shares may also be used by the board of directors to deter future attempts to gain control of the company 
the board of directors has sole authority to determine the terms of any one or more series of preferred stock  including voting rights  conversion rates and liquidation preferences 
as a result of the ability to fix voting rights for a series of preferred stock  the board has the power to issue a series of preferred stock that would have the effect of discouraging or blocking a post tender offer merger or other transaction by a third party 

table of contents shareholder rights plan our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
the rights plan is intended to improve the bargaining position of our board of directors in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire the company s outstanding common stock 
under the terms of the rights plan  a preferred stock purchase right is attached to each share of our common stock that is currently outstanding or becomes outstanding before the rights become exercisable  are redeemed or expire 
the rights will become exercisable only if an individual or group has acquired or obtained the right to acquire or announced a tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such individual or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common stock 
upon the occurrence of a triggering event  the rights will entitle every holder of our common stock  other than the acquirer  to purchase our stock or stock of our successor on terms that would likely be economically dilutive to the acquirer 
our board of directors  however  has the power to amend the rights plan so that it does not apply to a particular acquisition proposal or to redeem the rights for a nominal value before they become exercisable 
we believe these features will likely encourage an acquirer to negotiate with our board of directors before commencing a tender offer or to condition a tender offer on the board taking action to prevent the rights from becoming exercisable 
effective march   the rights agreement was amended to give the board of directors the right  in its sole discretion  to determine if any individual or group including all of their affiliates and associates should be exempted from being the beneficial owner and or acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding common stock of the company subject to certain terms and conditions if any that the board of directors may establish for said exemption 
supermajority shareholder approval may be required for fundamental transactions with an interested shareholder our articles of incorporation require that certain fundamental transactions must be approved by the holders of two thirds of each class of stock entitled to vote and two thirds of the total number of shares entitled to vote  unless a majority of disinterested directors has approved the transaction and other specified conditions are satisfied  in which case the required shareholder approval will be the minimum approval required by applicable law 
the transactions that are subject to this provision are various fundamental transactions between us and an interested shareholder or an affiliate of that shareholder 
these transactions include certain sales or other dispositions of our assets  certain issuances of our capital stock  certain transactions involving our merger  consolidation  division  reorganization  dissolution  liquidation or winding up or certain amendments of our articles of incorporation or bylaws 
we believe that the interested shareholder provision will likely encourage an acquirer to negotiate with the board of directors before commencing a tender offer 
approval of the nhpuc would be required for any acquisition of the company and the nhpuc would consider factors other than what is in the best interest of our shareholders 
our water utility subsidiaries are regulated by the nhpuc 
the nhpuc takes the position that under new hampshire law  water utility holding companies may not be acquired unless and until there is an order of the nhpuc approving the acquisition 
in practice  companies acquiring water utility holding companies in new hampshire have typically sought nhpuc approval as a condition of any transaction 
the nhpuc may approve an acquisition only if it determines that the acquisition will not have an adverse effect on rates  terms  service or operation of the utilities and is lawful  proper and in the public interest

table of contents item legal proceedings the city of nashua  new hampshire the city is engaged in an ongoing effort that began in to acquire all or a significant portion of the assets of pennichuck water  our largest utility subsidiary  through an eminent domain proceeding under new hampshire revised statutes annotated nhrsa chapter on july   the nhpuc issued its order in this matter  ruling that a taking of the assets of pennichuck water is in the public interest provided certain conditions are met  and provided that it pay to pennichuck water million for such assets measured as of december  the conditions include a requirement that nashua pay an additional million into a mitigation fund to protect the interests of the customers of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
another condition is that the city submit to the nhpuc  for its advance approval  the final operating contracts between the city and its planned contractors 
the remaining conditions cover various aspects of the operation and oversight of the water system under city ownership 
under new hampshire law  all parties to the proceeding and persons directly affected by the nhpuc s july order have days to seek reconsideration or a rehearing before the nhpuc 
our company and the city of nashua were the only parties to submit such motions in august and september see part i  item  business for a discussion of the background of the proceeding  the issues and uncertainties associated with the proceeding and the possible outcomes of the proceeding  which discussion is incorporated by reference into this item 
we are opposed to the city s proposed eminent domain taking of pennichuck water assets 
the company has stated publicly  however  that it remains open to engaging in settlement discussions with the city aimed at resolving this dispute outside of eminent domain 
the nhpuc s ruling on any request for reconsideration or a rehearing may be appealed to the new hampshire supreme court and the company has stated that  if necessary  it may do so 
we cannot predict when the nhpuc will rule on the pending motions from the city and our company  but we expect that a full rehearing and appeal process could take a year or more 
if the city ultimately is successful in obtaining a final determination that it can take some or all of pennichuck water s assets by eminent domain  it is not required under nhrsa ch 
to complete the taking and could ultimately choose not to proceed with the purchase of the assets 
the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
it is possible that  if the acquisition efforts of the city are successful  the financial position of the company would be materially impacted

we are engaged primarily in the collection  storage  treatment and distribution of potable water for domestic  industrial  commercial and fire protection service in new hampshire through our three utility subsidiaries pennichuck water works  inc pennichuck water  pennichuck east utility  inc pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct company  inc pittsfield aqueduct 
our water utility revenues constituted of our consolidated revenues in pennichuck water  our principal subsidiary which was established in  accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
pennichuck water s franchise area presently includes the city of nashua  new hampshire the city and surrounding municipalities 
our water subsidiaries are regulated by the new hampshire public utilities commission the nhpuc and must obtain nhpuc approval to increase their water rates to recover increases in operating expenses and to obtain the opportunity to earn a return on investments in plant and equipment 
new hampshire law provides that utilities are entitled to charge rates which permit them to earn a reasonable return on the cost of the property employed in serving their customers  less accrued depreciation  contributed capital and deferred income taxes rate base 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the nhpuc for inclusion in water rates  though there can be no assurance that the nhpuc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 
the businesses of our two other subsidiaries are non regulated water management services and real estate development and investment 
pennichuck water service corporation service corporation provides various non regulated water related monitoring  maintenance  testing and compliance reporting services for water systems for various towns  businesses and residential communities in and around southern and central new hampshire and eastern massachusetts 
its most significant contracts are with the towns of hudson and wilton  new hampshire and the towns of salisbury and barnstable  massachusetts 

table of contents the southwood corporation southwood is engaged in real estate management and commercialization activities 
historically  most of southwood s activities have been conducted through real estate joint ventures 
during the past years  southwood has participated in four residential real estate joint ventures and four commercial real estate joint ventures with john p 
stabile ii  stabile a local developer 
southwood s earnings and gains have from time to time during that period contributed a significant percentage of our consolidated net income  and have increased the fluctuations in our net income during that period 
while we expect to pursue the orderly commercialization of our remaining approximately acres of undeveloped non utility land over the next several years as an element of our overall business strategy  we expect generally that southwood will contribute a smaller proportion of our consolidated revenues and earnings in the future

table of contents events significantly affecting our earnings during recent years overview our earnings during the five year period ended december  were significantly affected by the following events that occurred during one or more years in that period sale of land and building owned by hecops i  ii and iii in january  sale of one cell tower lease in and eight cell tower leases in increased recorded amounts of afudc as a result of the ongoing upgrade of our water treatment plant  costs associated with our actions to oppose ongoing efforts by the city of nashua to acquire all or a significant portion of the assets of pennichuck water through an eminent domain proceeding under new hampshire utility law  defense and settlement costs related to parallel investigations by the us securities and exchange commission the sec and the new hampshire bureau of securities regulation the bureau that were conducted primarily in and settled in december  and sales of land by southwood  which were especially significant in southwood real estate related revenues our revenues and earnings were positively affected by sales of southwood land during two of the past five years 
the following table sets forth the amount of revenues that we recognized during each year in the to period attributable to those land sales and the percentage that those revenues represented of our total revenues during each of those years 
of southwood consolidated year land sales revenues s a a excludes the january sale of three commercial real estate properties that comprised substantially all of the assets of hecop i  ii and iii as more fully described in note  equity investments in unconsolidated companies in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
while we expect to pursue the orderly commercialization of approximately acres that comprise our remaining undeveloped non utility land over the next several years as an element of our overall business strategy  we expect that southwood s revenues from land sales will constitute a relatively minor percentage of our consolidated revenues in the future 

table of contents city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding the city of nashua  new hampshire the city is engaged in an ongoing effort that began in to acquire all or a significant portion of the assets of pennichuck water  our largest utility subsidiary  through an eminent domain proceeding under new hampshire revised statutes annotated nhrsa chapter see part i  item  business and part i  item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k for a discussion of the background of the proceeding  the issues and uncertainties associated with the proceeding and the possible outcomes of the proceeding which discussions are incorporated herein by reference 
we are opposed to the city s proposed eminent domain taking of pennichuck water assets 
our annual eminent domain related expenses in through were million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies  significant estimates and judgments we have identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in significant changes to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
regulatory accounting the use of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation stipulates generally accepted accounting principles for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator such as the nhpuc 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we defer costs and credits on the consolidated balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits are incurred 
these deferred amounts  both assets and liabilities  are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the same period that they are reflected in rates charged to our water utilities customers 
in the event that the inclusion in the rate making process is disallowed  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or change in regulatory approval 
we did not defer the costs associated with our defense against the city s ongoing eminent domain proceeding 

table of contents revenue recognition the revenues of our water utility subsidiaries are based on authorized rates approved by the nhpuc 
estimates of water utility revenues for water delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period 
we read our customer meters on a monthly basis and record revenues based on meter reading results 
unbilled revenues from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period are estimated based on historical usage and the effective water rates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
our non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
pension and other post retirement benefits our pension and other post retirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  plan design  the level of cash contributions made to the plans  earnings on the plans assets  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  changes in pension and post retirement benefit obligations other than pensions pbop associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension and pbop costs in the consolidated statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants 
in determining pension obligation and expense amounts  the factors and assumptions described above may change from period to period and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and pbop costs and funding requirements 
further  the value of our pension plan assets are subject to fluctuations in market returns which may result in increased or decreased pension expense in future periods 
although our pension plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of  market declines significantly impacted the value of our pension plan assets in which we expect will unfavorably impact pension expense in accordingly  we currently anticipate that we will contribute approximately million to the plan during as compared to  in 
table of contents results of operations general in this section  we discuss our  and results of operations and the factors affecting them 
our operating activities  as discussed in greater detail in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  are grouped into three reportable business segments as follows water utility operations  water management services  real estate operations  and other our consolidated revenues tend to be significantly affected by weather conditions experienced throughout the year and  from time to time  by final orders of the nhpuc on our requests for rate increases 
water revenues are typically at their lowest point during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
water revenues in the second and third quarters tend to be greater because of increased water consumption for nonessential usage by our customers during the late spring and summer months 
results of operations compared to overview for the year ended december   our consolidated net income was million  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  on a per share basis  fully diluted income per share for was as compared to per share for the principal factors that affected current year net income  relative to prior year net income  are the following rate relief granted by the nhpuc to all three of our regulated water utilities  record rainfall levels in southern new hampshire during the third quarter of which substantially reduced demand for our company s water  and therefore water utility revenues  during what is typically the highest demand quarter in the year  a non operating after tax gain of approximately million million before federal income tax from the sale of land and three commercial office buildings by three of our four hecop joint ventures  a non operating gain of million pre tax from the sale of eight cell tower leases  an increase in regulated water utility operating expenses of approximately million  an increase in interest expense of  a reduction in eminent domain related costs of  costs were net of a  cash payment from the city of nashua  and an increase in the provision for income taxes of  
table of contents water utility operations our water utility operations include the activities of pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct  each of which is regulated by the nhpuc 
on a combined basis  operating income of our three utilities for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  from our water utility operating revenues increased to approximately million in  or from  as shown in the following table 
year ended december  change s pennichuck water pennichuck east pittsfield total water utility operating revenues increased by million due principally to the application of higher water rates granted by the nhpuc to all three of the company s utilities pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct to substantially reduced water usage volumes resulting from record rainfall levels in the third quarter of recorded rainfall in the third quarter of  as reported to the national weather service from our nashua water treatment plant  set an all time record of inches compared to the prior record of inches in and the long term average of inches for the same period 
in addition  the record rainfall was spread relatively evenly over each of the three months in the third quarter  further impacting customers summer irrigation and other outdoor usage during that quarter and into the fourth quarter of see part i  item  regulation in this annual report on form k for a discussion of rate matters 
for the year ended december   approximately of our water utility operating revenues were derived from commercial and industrial customers  approximately from residential customers  with the balance being derived from fire protection and other billings to municipalities  principally the city of nashua and the towns of amherst  merrimack and milford  new hampshire 
we believe that due to the combined effects of the current economic slowdown  changing demographics and conservation measures  water consumption from existing customers has generally been declining 
we also believe that further consumption decline may result from increased customer conservation efforts as a result of current and future rate increases and the recently completed implementation of monthly billing which replaced quarterly billing for all our customers 

table of contents for the year ended december   utility operating expenses increased by approximately million  or approximately  to approximately million as shown in the table below 
year ended december  change s operations maintenance depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total the change in our utilities operating expenses over the same period in was primarily the result of the following increased depreciation and amortization expense totaling  and increased property taxes of  principally due to the completed portions of the water treatment plant upgrade for pennichuck water   of increased production costs largely related to increased fuel  power and purification costs   of increased transmission and distribution costs relating to repair or replacement of gates  mains  meters and hydrants  supplies  fuel and labor costs  and  of increased general and administrative costs primarily relating to higher costs for employee benefits and property and casualty insurance  offset in part by a reduction in accrued bonuses resulting from operating performance variations between the comparable periods 
as a result of the above changes in operating revenue and operating expenses  water utility operating income declined by  or to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  water management services the following table provides a breakdown of revenues from our non regulated water service business for the years ended december  and year ended december  change s municipal contracts base fees under contracts municipal contracts additional to base scope of contracts community system contracts watertight and other total 
table of contents municipal base contract fees increased by  primarily due to annual adjustments to the base fees charged to existing customers as a result of cpi indexed increases provided for in our contracts 
the increase in additional contract work of  was due principally to major projects undertaken for our salisbury  ma customer  extra work performed for customers to repair and restore facilities as a result of a major december ice storm  and an increase in compliance work for some of our small systems customers ie arsenic removal systems and other treatment improvements 
watertight and other income increased by  principally due to a  increase in contract testing programs 
for the year ended december   total operating expenses associated with our non regulated water service business increased  from maintenance costs for servicing our various operating contracts increased by  the increase in maintenance expense was partially offset by a decrease in the amount of professional  marketing and general and administrative expenses of  and a decrease of  for bad debt expense 
as a result  operating income related to the water service business increased to  for the year ended december  real estate operations as of december  and  the company  principally through its southwood subsidiary  owned approximately acres of non utility undeveloped land in southern new hampshire 
as of december   southwood also held a ownership interest in one real estate joint venture organized as a limited liability company 
as of december   southwood held a ownership interest in four real estate joint ventures organized as a limited liability companies 
the company expects to pursue the commercialization of acres of non utility undeveloped land in southern new hampshire  over the next several years as market conditions improve 
for the year ended december   southwood s equity share of pre tax earnings from the four real estate joint ventures hecop i  ii iii and iv was approximately million  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in the joint ventures pre tax earnings was due principally to an approximately million gain before federal income tax from the january sale of the three commercial real estate properties owned by three of the four joint ventures 
in december  the three joint ventures that held these properties hecop i  ii and iii were dissolved 
the real estate assets sold by three of the four joint ventures comprised substantially all of the assets of those three joint ventures 
the fourth joint venture currently owns undeveloped land and generates no revenue 
consequently  earnings or losses from these joint ventures for the foreseeable future are expected to be insignificant 
expenses associated with our real estate operations were  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of  was attributable to a decrease in salaries and benefits of approximately  and a decrease in the intercompany management fee of  eminent domain expenses  net our eminent domain expenses were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the eminent domain expenses were primarily attributable to reviewing and analyzing the nhpuc s july  eminent domain order and preparing our motion for rehearing filed in august the amount for the year ended december  is net of a  cash payment received from the city of nashua pursuant to an agreement with the city to suspend the eminent domain hearings 
the eminent domain expenses were primarily attributable to expenses incurred in preparing for and conducting the merits hearing  and to a lesser extent  expenses related to settlement discussions 

table of contents other expense income  net other expense income  net for the year ended december  was  as compared to million for the year ended december  included in other income in is a gain on the sale of eight cell tower leases in the amount of million 
allowance for funds used during construction afudc for the year ended december  and  we recorded afudc of approximately  and  respectively 
the  decrease is largely attributable to the completion of certain large projects qualifying for afudc during the reported periods 
this trend is expected to continue principally because the upgrade to pennichuck water s water treatment plant is scheduled for completion in early interest income for the year ended december  and  we recorded interest income of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase of  is primarily attributable to higher short term investment balances throughout the year 
interest expense for the year ended december   our interest expense was approximately million  compared to million in the increase of  is primarily attributable to the issuance of million principal amount tax exempt bonds in october and an additional million of tax exempt bonds in may partially offsetting this increase was the october  redemption of pennichuck water s million series b bonds 
interest expense in both periods primarily represents interest on long term indebtedness of our company s three regulated water utilities 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  and  we recorded an income tax provision of million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to federal income taxes on the gain on the sale of the real estate held by the hecop i  ii  and iii joint ventures 
the effective income tax rate for these periods was and  respectively 
the state of new hampshire income tax liability on income attributable to our company s four joint ventures is imposed at the llc level  and not at the pennichuck corporation level in contrast to federal income taxes 
therefore  state of new hampshire income taxes are reflected under net earnings loss from investments accounted for under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the amount of such state taxes is approximately  this is why the provision for income taxes for  as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes  is lower in than it was for 
table of contents results of operations compared to overview for the year ended december   our consolidated net income was million  compared to net income of  in on a per share basis  fully diluted income per share for was as compared to per share for the increase in consolidated net income of million for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the following factors

our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in our combined revenues was primarily attributable to rate relief granted to pennichuck water and pennichuck east  and to combined water utility customer growth 
water utility operations on a combined basis  net income of our three utilities for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from water utility operating revenues increased by million as a result of rate increases and customer growth and higher consumption resulting from dryer weather in compared to the combined utility customer base during the year increased  resulting in a total combined customer base of approximately  as of december  water utility operating income also benefited from a change in the method of allocating certain overhead and administrative costs between regulated and non regulated operations 

table of contents the increase in revenues was partially offset by increases in operating expenses 
our utility operating revenues increased to approximately million in  or from for  approximately  and of our total utility operating revenues were generated by pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct  respectively  as shown in the following table

water management services the following table provides a breakdown of revenues from our non regulated water management services operations for the years ended december  and change s municipal contracts community system contracts watertight and other total for the year ended december   total operating expenses associated with our water management services remained unchanged from at million 
these costs are comprised primarily of direct costs for servicing our various operating contracts as well as allocated intercompany charges for general and administrative support for contract operations 
total operating costs include an increase of  in intercompany charges resulting from a change in our allocation methodology  as well as an increase in the actual level of corporate expenses 
the resultant increase was essentially offset by a  decrease in marketing expenses  an  decrease in professional fees and a  decrease in maintenance expenses

the remaining ownership interest in each joint venture was then primarily held by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer  with whom southwood has also participated in four residential joint ventures during the past years 
southwood uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in the joint ventures 
consequently  southwood s investment is adjusted for its share of earnings or losses and for any distributions received from the joint venture 
for the year ended december   southwood s share of pre tax earnings from these joint ventures was approximately  compared to pre tax loss of  for the increase in the joint ventures pre tax earnings resulted primarily from increased occupancies in the hecop i and hecop iii buildings during southwood s share of pre tax earnings loss is included under net earnings loss from investments accounted for under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of funds are cash flow from utility operations  cash proceeds from the sale of portions of our real estate holdings  borrowings pursuant to our bank revolving credit facility and proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities 
our primary uses of funds are capital expenditures associated with our continuous utility construction programs  dividends on our common stock payable as and when declared by our board of directors and repayments of principal on our outstanding debt obligations  whether pursuant to scheduled sinking fund payments or final maturities 
for the past several years  cash flows have fluctuated largely based on four factors i weather  ii amount and timing of rate increases  iii gains recognized on the sale of non utility real estate and cell tower leases  as discussed above  and iv the costs associated with the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding 
during the period from through  in addition to cash flow from operations  we realized million of net proceeds from the sale of various debt securities 
we generated an aggregate  during the same period through the issuance of new shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan drcspp and through the exercise of stock options 
capital expenditures program we expect our capital expenditures to return to normal levels in through due to the substantial completion of the water treatment plant

for the period to  capital expenditures for water distribution  storage and supply totaled million 
for the period to  comparable expenditures are expected to be approximately million 

table of contents external financing requirements we expect that the majority of our funding requirements will be provided by cash flow from our operations after payment of dividends on common stock but before repayment of current principal due on long term debt 
we expect that the balance of our funding requirements will be obtained through short and long term debt borrowings and  to a lesser extent  through the issuance of common stock pursuant to our drcspp 
our timing and mix of future debt and equity financing is subject to a number of factors including  but not limited to i debt and equity market conditions  ii the need to maintain a balanced capital structure in order to preserve financial flexibility and to manage the overall cost of capital  iii certain debt issuance covenants as contained in our outstanding loan agreements  and iv the impact of the ongoing eminent domain dispute on our ability to raise debt or equity capital and the cost of such capital 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete all or any of the future debt and equity financings described below or to complete them on a timely basis 
the receipt of timely and adequate rate relief will also be critically important in providing us cash flow from operations and the ability to access credit and permanent capital  both debt and equity  at reasonable costs and terms 
we are unable  however  to predict the outcome of our future rate relief filings 
as more fully discussed in part i  item  legal proceedings in this annual report on form k  an order by the nhpuc on the city s eminent domain petition was issued on july  in its order  the nhpuc ruled that the taking of the assets of pennichuck water is in the public interest provided certain conditions are met  and that the price to be paid to pennichuck water for such assets is million measured as of december  the conditions include a requirement that nashua place an additional million into a mitigation fund to protect the interests of the customers of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
subsequent to the order  both parties filed motions for rehearing or reconsideration before the nhpuc 
the company has also stated that  if necessary  it will consider filing an appeal to the new hampshire supreme court 
given the uncertainty related to an nhpuc rehearing  or a possible new hampshire supreme court appeal proceeding  we may find that we are unable to  or elect not to  issue equity and or debt securities until proceedings on the city s eminent domain petition have been concluded and or settled 
alternatively  we may find that the cost that we incur in connection with the issuance or remarketing of such debt increases materially 
we believe these risks are particularly relevant to a portion of the long term tax exempt bonds that were issued on our behalf in through the business finance authority of the state of new hampshire 
of the initial million offering  proceeds totaling approximately million are currently held in escrow for the sole benefit of the bondholders 
the associated debt is non recourse to us until the proceeds are loaned to pennichuck water 
upon one or more requests by pennichuck water  some or all of the proceeds of those bonds will be loaned to pennichuck water to finance its water treatment plant upgrade and other certain other capital projects 
when pennichuck water borrows the bond proceeds  the associated bonds will be remarketed to investors who will be relying on pennichuck water as the source of repayment rather than the escrow fund 
if  because of the uncertainties described above relating to the eminent domain dispute  pennichuck water is unable to  or elects not to  remarket the bonds as debt securities for which pennichuck water is liable  it would not be able to borrow any of the bond proceeds then in escrow and the associated debt would not become pennichuck water s obligation 
under these circumstances  we would expect to rely primarily on our cash flow from operations  our cash and short term investment balances and  thereafter  on our bank revolving credit facility to finance pennichuck water s water treatment plant upgrade and other capital projects 
our borrowing costs under that credit facility would likely be higher than tax exempt bond financing costs 
borrowings under the credit facility would also reduce our liquidity to meet other obligations 

table of contents in addition to authorizing a tax exempt bond financing  we have applied and will continue to apply for long term debt funds directly from the state of new hampshire under the state s revolving fund program srf 
funds provided under srf loans carry long term fixed costs at interest rates set with reference to various municipal bond indices  which rates are generally below the rates for comparable us treasury securities of like maturity 
as of december   we had eight outstanding srf loans with principal balances outstanding of approximately million 
funds available for future advances as of december  totaled approximately million 
during  we expect to draw down approximately  of those available funds on existing srf loans 
significant financial covenants our million revolving credit loan agreement with bank of america expires june  this agreement contains three financial maintenance tests which must be met on a quarterly basis 
these maintenance tests are as follows our fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed x  our tangible net worth must exceed million  plus new equity issued subsequent to december  and our funded debt less certain cash and short term investment balances  if any must not exceed of our total capitalization 
also  various pennichuck water and pennichuck east loan agreements contain tests that govern the issuance of additional indebtedness 
these issuance tests are as follows to issue short term debt  our total debt must not exceed of our total capital unless the new short term debt is subordinated to existing debt  to issue long term debt  our funded debt must not exceed of our property additions  and to issue long term debt  our earnings available for interest divided by our interest expense must exceed x 
certain covenants as described below in pennichuck water s and pennichuck east s loan agreements and in our bank of america revolving credit loan agreement effectively restrict our ability to upstream common dividends from pennichuck water and pennichuck east  as well as pay common dividends to our shareholders 
several of pennichuck water s loan agreements contain a covenant that requires pennichuck water to maintain a minimum net worth of million 
as of december   pennichuck water s net worth was million 
one of pennichuck east s loan agreements contains a covenant that requires pennichuck east to maintain a minimum net worth of million 
as of december   pennichuck east s net worth was million 

table of contents as of december   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
our ability to incur significant additional long term debt and to continue to satisfy these tests depends  among other factors  on receipt of timely and adequate rate relief 
off balance sheet arrangements on august   pennichuck water implemented a legal defeasance transaction for its outstanding  new hampshire industrial development authority series tax exempt bonds series bonds 
pennichuck water placed us treasury securities in an irrevocable escrow account with the bank of new york  the bond trustee  in an aggregate amount sufficient to provide for all remaining scheduled principal and interest payments on the series bonds 
this defeasance transaction discharged all future pennichuck water obligations with respect to the series bonds and pennichuck water no longer records the debt in its consolidated financial statements 
in addition  pennichuck water is no longer be subject to the covenants under the series bonds  one of which restricted pennichuck water from issuing long term debt unless pennichuck water s earnings available for interest divided by its interest expense exceeded 
as of december   southwood had a ownership interest in three joint ventures known as hecop i  hecop ii and hecop iii 
as discussed in note  net earnings loss from investments accounted for under the equity method for the year ended december  includes a non recurring  non operating  after state tax gain of approximately million million after federal income taxes from the january sale of land and three commercial office buildings that were owned by these three joint ventures 
the land and office buildings sold comprised substantially all of the assets of hecop i  ii  and iii 
as a result  these three joint ventures were liquidated in december these three joint ventures were organized as limited liability companies 
the remaining ownership interest in each of the three joint ventures was primarily held by john p 
stabile ii  a local developer with whom southwood has also participated in one other joint venture known as hecop iv 
the three joint ventures  whose assets and liabilities are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  owned certain commercial office buildings on which there were outstanding mortgage notes totaling million as of december  the mortgage notes were each secured by the underlying property 
distributions from the three joint ventures have from time to time during the past ten years been a significant source of funds to support our dividend payments to shareholders 
we account for southwood s investment in the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting  and therefore we recognize on a current basis of each joint venture s operating results 
those results reflect ongoing carrying costs such as maintenance and property taxes 
information about our revenues  expenses and cash flows arising from the joint ventures is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have assessed these equity investments in accordance with fin r consolidation of variable interest entities  and have determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities 
in october  we completed a tax exempt debt financing with the new hampshire bond finance authority bfa 
the bfa acts solely as a passive conduit to the tax exempt bond markets with us acting as the obligor for the associated tax exempt debt 
as of december  we had borrowed million of the million offering 
the remaining million was placed in escrow for the sole benefit of bondholders with no recourse to us and hence we have not recorded the associated debt as a long term liability 
we expect to draw these funds as we incur expenditures for applicable capital projects

pension plan 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our employees 
the accounting for this plan under financial accountings standard board fasb no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  requires that we use key assumptions when computing the estimated annual pension expense 
these assumptions are i the discount rate applied to the projected benefit obligation  ii the long term rate of return on plan assets and iii the long term rate of future increases in compensation 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of our pension obligations and our annual pension funding 
a range of discount rates is established and periodically modified by the internal revenue service to calculate a pension plan s current benefit obligation for purposes of the full funding limits imposed on such plans 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on the plan s expected asset allocation  expected returns on various classes of plan assets as well as historical returns 
we assumed that our long term rate of return on pension plan assets was in  and in addition  we assumed an increase in participant compensation levels of in  and these key assumptions are reviewed annually with our actuary and investment advisor and are updated to reflect the plan s experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from our actuarial assumptions because of economic and other conditions and may impact the amount of funding we contribute to the plan
