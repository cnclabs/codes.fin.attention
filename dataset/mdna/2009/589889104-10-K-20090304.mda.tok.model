item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview despite difficult worldwide economic conditions during  we reported record sales and earnings for the twelve months ended december  this improvement  compared to our results  was largely the result of a increase in sales  a substantial improvement in gross margins of basis points  and relatively flat operating expenses as a percentage of sales  and was partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate of basis points 
all of these improvements produced record earnings of million  up from the prior year 
during  we plan to implement new automation and manufacturing cost saving improvements related to logistics and product labeling  and introduce new products through organic growth and acquisitions  which we believe will increase our average product margins 
also  we plan to identify a location outside the us to locate a manufacturing site in an effort to reduce our product costs 
to date  the overall slowdown in the economy that began in and has continued into has not significantly affected our operations  as many of our products are not used for elective procedures  and are not capital equipment 
for the year ended december   we reported net sales of million  up million or over net sales 
net sales growth in was primarily driven by increased sales of our custom kit and procedure tray products up  stand alone products up  including swabbable valves  stopcocks  oem parts  tubing  and hemostasis valves and catheters up  particularly our prelude sheath product line  mini access kit catheter product line  micrus catheter product line and diagnostic cardiology catheters 
our gross margins as a percentage of sales were for the year ended december   compared to for year ended december  this significant improvement resulted primarily from lower average fixed overhead unit costs resulting from increased production unit costs decreased as fixed costs were shared over an increased number of units  lower unit costs for products manufactured in mexico  price increases and production automation 
these improvements also helped offset raw material and production labor cost increases that occurred during net income increased for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the prior year 
when compared to the prior year  net income for the year ended december  was positively affected by increased sales volumes and higher gross margins  and partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income from operations income before income tax expense net income our net sales increased by million  or  in  compared to an increase of million  or  in  and an increase of million  or  in we report sales in four product categories 
listed below are the sales relating to these product categories for the years ended december    and december  change change change stand alone devices custom kits procedure trays inflation devices catheters total our sales increased during  notwithstanding the fact that the markets for many of our products are experiencing slight pricing declines as our customers try to reduce their costs 
substantially all of the increase in our 
table of contents revenues was attributable to increased unit sales  except for a slight increase in revenues attributable to an increase in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar which increased sales by in compared to  in compared to  and in compared to historically  an important part of our revenue growth came from increases in the number of procedures performed for patients in a given year 
starting in april  the growth rate of coronary stents and other related procedures in the us dropped significantly  reducing the traditional growth rate of our us direct sales 
new products are another source of revenue growth 
in  and  our sales of new products represented  and of sales  respectively 
included in those sales are revenues from recent acquisitions of  and for  and  respectively 
the third main source of revenue increases came from market share gains in our existing product lines 
international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales 
these increases primarily resulted from greater acceptance of our products in international markets  ongoing growth in our european direct sales  and increased sales related to improvement in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar  as discussed above 
our total direct sales in france  germany  the uk  belgium  the netherlands  denmark  sweden  austria and ireland were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins in resulted primarily from lower average fixed overhead unit costs resulting from increased production unit costs decreased as fixed costs were shared over an increased number of units  lower unit costs for products manufactured in mexico  customer price increases and production automation 
these improvements also helped offset raw material and production labor cost increases that occurred during the increase in gross margins in was principally the result of production efficiencies resulting in lower headcount  product mix improvement  the transfer of the manufacturing process of four products to mexico  and certain automation projects 
the decline in gross margins in resulted primarily from investments made during the second half of for new facilities and related costs ie utilities  maintenance  cleaning and taxes and equipment 
gross margins in were also affected by the increased cost of direct labor  increased health insurance costs  our adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  effective january   and increased procedure tray sales in  which have lower gross margins than our overall gross margins 
our selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  in over  million  or  in over  million  or  in over selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in when compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of higher commissions commensurate with higher sales  management and sales bonuses for meeting quarterly and annually objectives  increased travel related expenses and increased national account administration fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were also affected by approximately  of damages net of insurance reimbursement of  sustained by our angleton  texas facility during hurricane ike in september the significant basis points decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as a percentage of sales  was primarily the result of operating leverage from reducing head count  while increasing sales 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative costs in as a percentage of sales  was primarily the result of a full year of costs associated with the hiring of additional sales representatives in the second half of  approximately  attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
r and an impairment charge of approximately  primarily relating to intellectual property assets acquired from sub q in march research and development expenses increased to million in  compared to million in our r d expense for increased to million  compared to million in  r d expenses for increased to million  compared to million in the increase in r d expenses in  and was related primarily to r d head count additions and indirect costs to support an increase in the number of new products we launched 
our r d expenses as a percentage of sales were for  for and for we have a full pipeline of new products and management believes that we have an effective level of capabilities and expertise to continue the flow of new internally developed products into the future 
our effective income tax rates for   and were   and  respectively 
the increase in the effective income tax rate for over was primarily the result of investment losses sustained in our deferred compensation plan that are not deductible for tax purposes 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate for over was primarily the result of the unrecognized tax benefits  related to financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which expired on our federal  state  and foreign tax returns and a non taxed gain related to corporate owned variable life insurance contracts for our deferred compensation plan 
the increase in the effective tax rate for over was primarily the result of our reimbursement of costs incurred by our irish subsidiary for the development of two new products which are taxed at a lower income tax rate than our us operations 

table of contents our other income for   and was approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in other income for over and over was primarily the result of an increase in interest income attributable to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates 
the decrease in other income for over was primarily the result of a decrease in cash balances and a corresponding decrease in interest income of approximately our net income for   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
net income for was positively affected by increased sales volumes and higher gross margins  and partially offset by higher effective income tax rates 
net income for was positively affected by increased sales volumes  higher gross margins  lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales and a lower effective income tax rate 
net income for was negatively affected by lower gross margins  higher research and development spending  increased selling  general and administrative expenses  and positively affected by increased sales volumes 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january   we no longer amortize goodwill from business acquisitions  but review annually the impairment of goodwill  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we completed our initial testing of goodwill as of january  and determined that there was no impairment 
we have elected to perform our annual testing of goodwill impairment as of july of the applicable fiscal year 
as of july   we performed our annual testing of goodwill for impairment and determined that there was no impairment 
also  as of december   we concluded there were no events or circumstances indicating that impairment had occurred 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was unlikely we would pursue the product associated with the intellectual property acquired from sub q due to our decision to pursue other priorities and opportunities that we believe are more favorable to us 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in selling  general and administrative expense for  which included approximately  related to goodwill 
we had no impairments in goodwill for the years ended december  and the remaining unamortized amount of goodwill at december  was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources capital commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our capital commitments and contractual obligations as of december   including operating lease payments and office lease payments  as well as the future periods in which such payments are currently anticipated to become due payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases royalty obligations total contractual cash we have approximately million of unrecognized tax positions that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with fin that have not been included in the contractual obligations table due to uncertainty as to when such amounts may be settled 
additional information regarding our capital commitments and contractual obligations  including royalty payments  is contained in notes   and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  set forth in item cash flows our cash flow from operations was million in  a decrease  of million over this decrease in cash flow from operations in  when compared to  came mostly from an increase in inventories compared to a decrease in an approximate change of million  which was partially offset by an increase in net income in over our working capital for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital for over was primarily the result of an increase in cash generated from our net income and cash generated from the issuance of shares of common stock related to employee stock option exercises 
the increase in working capital for over was primarily the result of an increase in cash net of the reduction in inventories of million as we focused on improving our inventory turns 
the increase in working capital for over was primarily the result of an increase in cash flow from operations of million and a reduction in the amount of capital expenditures made  when compared to 
table of contents on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with bank of america  na bank of america  whereby bank of america agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of  prior to december   we maintained a long term revolving credit facility the facility with zions first national bank zions 
the facility had a credit limit of  for years and the facility expired on june  on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with zions  whereby zions agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of  we had outstanding under our lines of credit as of december   and historically  we have incurred significant expenses in connection with product development and introduction of new products 
substantial capital has also been required to finance the increase in our receivables and inventories associated with our increased sales 
during  we spent approximately million on various production equipment related to automation  capacity increases  and product launches  and approximately million to complete our new customer service and distribution facility for our european operations in the netherlands 
during  we spent approximately million on various production equipment related to automation and new product launches  approximately million for construction costs on a new customer service and distribution facility for our european operations in the netherlands and million for improvements made to a production clean room in south jordan  utah 
during  we spent approximately million for various production equipment  approximately million on building and leasehold improvements  and approximately million on the purchase of real estate in the netherlands to build a distribution facility 
our principal source of funding for these and other expenses has been cash generated from operations  sales of equity  and bank lines of credit 
we currently believe that our present sources of liquidity and capital are adequate for current operations and for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has requested that all registrants address their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the representation of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ  and may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates could occur in the future from period to period 
our management has discussed the development and selection of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following paragraphs identify our most critical accounting policies inventory obsolescence reserve 
our management reviews on a regular basis inventory quantities on hand for unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
this review of inventory quantities for unmarketable and or slow moving products is based on estimates of forecasted product demand prior to expiration lives 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that the amount included in our obsolescence reserve has been a historically accurate estimate of the unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
our obsolescence reserve was approximately million as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts 
a majority of our receivables are with hospitals which  over our history  have demonstrated favorable collection rates 
therefore  we have experienced relatively minimal bad debts from hospital customers 
in limited circumstances  we have written off minimal bad debts as the result of the termination of foreign distributors 
the most significant write offs over our history have come from us packers who bundle our products in surgical trays 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based upon historical experience and a review of individual customer balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our bad debt reserve was approximately  at december  which is consistent with historical collection experience 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  we measure share based compensation cost at the grant date based on the value of the award and recognize the cost as an expense over the term of the vesting period 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ 
table of contents significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fin effective january  under fin  tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
although we believe our provisions for fin unrecognized tax positions are reasonable  we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
the tax law is subject to varied interpretations  and we have taken positions related to certain matters where the law is subject to interpretation 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provisions and operating results in the period s in which we make such determination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro and great britain pound gbp relative to the value of the us dollar 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in  and our principal currency is  the us dollar 
a portion of our revenues million  representing approximately of aggregate revenues  for the year ended december  was attributable to sales that were denominated in euros and gbps  all other international sales were denominated in us dollars 
certain expenses are also denominated in euros and gbps  which partially offsets risks associated with fluctuations of exchanges rates between the euro and gbp on the one hand  and the us dollar on the other hand 
because of our euro and gbp denominated revenues and expenses  in a year in which our euro and gbp denominated revenues exceed our euro and gbp based expenses  the value of such euro and gbp denominated net income increases if the value of the euro and gbp increase relative to the value of the us dollar  and decreases if the value of the euro and gbp decrease relative to the value of the u 
s 
dollar 
during the year ended december   the exchange rate between the euro and gbp against the us dollar resulted in an increase of our gross revenues of approximately million and in gross profit 
on november   we forecasted a net exposure for december  representing the difference between euro and gbp denominated receivables and euro and gbp denominated payables of approximately  euros and  gbps  respectively 
in order to partially offset such risks  on november   we entered into a day forward contract for euros and gbps 
we generally enter into similar economic transactions at various times during the year to partially offset exchange rate risks we bear throughout the year 
during the years ended december  and  we experienced a net gain of approximately  and  respectively  from financing transactions executed during and in an effort to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rates of the euro and gbp relative to the us dollar 
we do not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
another market risk relates to variable rate debt 
as of december   we had no variable rate debt 
as long as we do not have variable rate debt  our interest expense would not be affected by changes in interest rates
