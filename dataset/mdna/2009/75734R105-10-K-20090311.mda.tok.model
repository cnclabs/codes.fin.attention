item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the item selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto beginning on page f  and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the largest manufacturer and distributor of packaged ice in the united states and serve a variety of customers in states and the district of columbia 
our business consists of the traditional manufacture and delivery of ice from a central point of production to the point of sale  and the installation and operation of the ice factory  our proprietary equipment located in high volume locations that produces  packages and stores ice through an automated  self contained system 
seasonality 
our results of operations are highly seasonal  characterized by peak demand during the warmer months of may through september  with an extended peak selling season in the southern united states 
as a result of this seasonality and the fixed costs in our business  the proportion of revenues earned and the ratio of costs to revenues in any given quarter are not necessarily indicative of the ratios for a full year 
revenues within specific markets can also be affected by weather conditions  with cool or rainy weather negatively impacting demand and extremely hot weather increasing our costs as we respond to excess customer demand for our products 
approximately  and of our revenues occurred during the second and third calendar quarters in  and  respectively 
as a result of seasonal revenue declines and a less than proportional decline in certain expenses during the first and fourth calendar quarters  we typically experience lower profit margins resulting in losses during these periods 
in addition  because a significant portion of our annual sales are generated during the second and third calendar quarters  our annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly if the weather during these periods is unusually cool or rainy on a national or regional basis 
cool and rainy weather has a negative impact on operations  while warm and dry weather generally has a positive impact 
for additional information concerning the impact of seasonality on our results of operations  see general economic trends and seasonality 
revenues 
our revenues primarily represent sales of packaged ice and packaged ice bags for use in our ice factory equipment 
there is no right of return with respect to these products 
a portion of our revenues also represents fees earned under management agreements for ice factories located outside our primary territories that are recognized as earned under contract terms 
cost of sales excluding depreciation 
our cost of sales excluding depreciation consists of costs related to the manufacture and distribution of our products  including  in particular manufacturing and distribution labor costs  raw materials primarily polyethylene based plastic bags  product delivery expenses  including fuel and vehicle rental expense related to products delivered by our own distribution network  as well as fees paid to distributors who deliver ice to our customers on our behalf  utility expenses primarily electricity used in connection with the manufacturing  storage and distribution processes  and ice factory related costs associated with customer service representatives and machine technicians note  however  that ice factories generally do not increase our plant occupancy  delivery or utility costs 

table of contents depreciation expense related to cost of sales and depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are divided into two line items depreciation expense related to cost of sales and depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense related to cost of sales consists of depreciation expense for our production and distribution equipment

these other professional services were composed primarily of additional audit fees of million related to a change in audit firms  million of consulting fees related to various corporate projects and initiatives and million of costs for miscellaneous accounting and consulting projects 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased million from to this increase is primarily due to additional amortization expense associated with the intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions completed in and impairment of goodwill and long lived assets as a result of the decline in our stock price during the three months ended september   our stockholders equity exceeded our equity market capitalization including the application of a reasonable control premium as of september  and  as a result  we performed a goodwill impairment assessment as of september  because we have only a single reporting unit  our impairment assessment primarily considered the company s stock price and did not include management s long range forecasts or any other valuation measures 
based on the evaluation of our enterprise value and the estimated amount by which the current fair value of our fixed assets and intangible assets exceeded their book value  we concluded that our goodwill was impaired 
as a result  a non cash charge of million pretax was recorded during the three months ended september  to reduce goodwill to its estimated fair value as of september  key assumptions for the impairment evaluation included the market price of company s stock and control premium 
based on the evaluation of the company s stock price and trading activity in

offsetting this fee was million of fees and expenses incurred by gso and its third party consultants in connection with the transaction that we agreed to pay 
we received a net payment of million from gso on february  income tax benefit expense the effective tax rate for continuing operations decreased from in to in primarily as result of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the three months ended september   a significant portion of which was non deductible for income tax purposes

liquidity and capital resources we intend to fund our ongoing capital and working capital requirements as well as debt service  including our internal growth and acquisitions  through a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and operating leases 
we generate cash from the sale of packaged ice through traditional delivery methods  by which we manufacture  package and store ice at a central facility and transport it to our customers retail locations when needed  and through ice factories  which manufacture  package and store ice in our customers retail locations 
our primary uses of cash are a cost of sales  b operating expenses  c debt service  d capital expenditures related to replacing and modernizing the capital equipment in our traditional ice plants and acquiring and installing additional ice factories  e acquisitions and f dividends on our common stock 
on september   we announced that we were suspending the payment of quarterly cash dividends indefinitely 
we have been and may continue to be required to use substantial amounts of cash to pay expenses relating to the ongoing investigations by the antitrust division of the united states department of justice and various other government agencies and related civil litigation 
see item legal proceedings 
historically  we have financed our capital and working capital requirements  including our acquisitions  through a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and operating leases 

table of contents our ability to generate cash from our operations is subject to weather  general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt and to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we do not have sufficient liquidity  we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying investments  capital expenditures or acquisitions 
we may also have to consider joint ventures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 
we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could  if necessary  be effected on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt instruments  including the terms of the credit agreement governing our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior discount notes  may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives 
during  capital expenditures totaled million 
as we have consolidated acquisitions into the existing company infrastructure  we have identified non core and excess assets which can be disposed of  such as real estate and machinery and equipment 
from time to time  we also dispose of other assets which are no longer useful in our operations 
as a result of dispositions of these non core and excess assets  we realized proceeds of approximately million in our net capital expenditures in were million 
in  we completed the acquisition of seven ice companies for a total cash purchase price of approximately million  including direct acquisition costs of million 
we also purchased one manufacturing facility which had previously been leased for million 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they become available 
in conjunction with these evaluations  we will consider our liquidity  availability under our credit facilities  mandatory principal repayments under our debt agreements and availability of other capital resources 
cash flows for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operations from to is primarily due to million decline in net income  after adjusting for non cash expenses and charges  offset by a million increase in cash provided by changes in working capital 
the working capital change was driven by an increase in accrued interest as a result of our senior notes accruing cash interest beginning november   offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory resulting from reduced volume sales 
the decrease in cash provided by operations from to is primarily due to a million decrease in net income  after adjusting for non cash expenses and charges  and a million increase in cash used by changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in was composed of net capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of ice companies and a leased manufacturing facility totaling million  offset by the receipt of million in connection with a property insurance settlement and the release of million of restricted cash related to the sale of our non ice businesses in the net proceeds from the sale of those businesses were million 
our senior credit agreement requires that the net proceeds from the sales be used either to repay term borrowings under the credit facility or to make acquisitions and or capital expenditures within twelve months of the receipt of such proceeds 
until used  the proceeds were on deposit in a restricted account with the administrative agent under the senior credit facility

on october   reddy holdings issued million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due in a private placement offering 
each senior discount note had an initial accreted value of per  principal amount at maturity 
the accreted value of each senior discount note increased from the date of issuance until november  at a rate of per annum such that the accreted value equaled the stated principal amount at maturity on november  thereafter  cash interest accrues and will be payable semi annually beginning may  at a rate of per annum 
the senior discount notes are unsecured obligations of reddy holdings and are not guaranteed by reddy holdings subsidiary  senior in right of payment to all of reddy holdings future subordinated indebtedness  equal in right of payment with any of reddy holdings existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness  effectively subordinated to reddy holdings existing and future secured debt  including reddy holdings guarantee of reddy corp s senior credit facility  and structurally subordinated to all obligations and preferred equity of reddy holdings subsidiary 
the senior discount notes include customary covenants that restrict  among other things  the ability to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock  pay dividends or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make certain investments  incur liens  enter into arrangements that restrict dividends from our subsidiary  merge or sell all or substantially all of the assets or enter into various transactions with affiliates 
from and after november   we may redeem any or all of the senior discount notes by paying a redemption premium which is initially of the principal amount at maturity of the senior discount notes  and will decline annually to zero commencing on november  if we experience a change of control we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior discount notes at a price equal to of their accreted value  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
we may also be required to make an offer to purchase the senior discount notes with proceeds of asset sales that are not reinvested in our business or used to repay other indebtedness 
we registered the senior discount notes with the sec pursuant to a registration statement that was declared effective on august  
table of contents the indenture governing our senior discount notes restricts the amount of dividends  distributions and other restricted payments we may pay 
under the indenture  we are restricted from paying dividends on our common stock unless  at the time of such payment no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof  the consolidated coverage ratio set forth in the indenture governing our senior discount notes exceeds to  and there is sufficient capacity under the buildup amount under the indenture governing our senior discount notes 
the consolidated coverage ratio under the indenture governing our senior discount notes is defined as the ratio of our adjusted ebitda for the most recent four fiscal quarters to our consolidated interest expense for such four quarter period 
adjusted ebitda under the indenture governing our senior discount notes is defined as the sum of our consolidated net income plus our income tax expense  our interest expense  our depreciation and amortization expense  unrealized non cash gains or losses or non cash charges in respect of hedging obligations required to be taken under generally accepted accounting principles  unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses and all other non cash charges  except to the extent representing an accrual or reserve for a future cash expenditure

we are generally required to calculate our consolidated coverage ratio on a pro forma basis to give effect to incurrences and repayments of indebtedness as well as acquisitions and dispositions 
the buildup amount equals of our consolidated net income accrued during the period treated as one accounting period from july  to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available or  if such consolidated net income is a deficit  minus of such deficit  plus  the net cash proceeds of the issuance of capital stock  subject to certain exceptions  and any cash capital contribution received by us from our stockholders in each case after august  plus the amount by which our indebtedness is reduced on our balance sheet as a result of the conversion or exchange of such indebtedness for our capital stock  plus the net reduction in certain restricted investments made by us  less the amount of certain restricted payments we make from time to time  including  among other things  the payment of cash dividends 
as of december   
table of contents the buildup amount was negative  primarily as a result of the million non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the three months ended december  we are not currently permitted to pay dividends under this provision 
in addition  regardless of whether we could make any restricted payments under the buildup amount provision referred to above  we may make dividend payments at any time in an aggregate amount of up to million if no default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture and following our initial public offering  pay dividends on our capital stock of up to per year of the cash proceeds net of underwriters fees  discounts  commissions or other expenses paid by us received by us from all such public equity offerings subject to specified conditions 
accordingly  we are able to pay approximately million annually in dividends under this provision 
however  the amount of dividend payments permitted under this provision will correspondingly reduce the amount we would otherwise have available to us under the buildup amount for restricted payments  including dividends 
credit facilities 
on august   reddy ice group  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  entered into new credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of million with a syndicate of banks  financial institutions and other entities as lenders  including credit suisse  cayman islands branch  as administrative agent  cibc world markets corp  bear stearns corporate lending inc and lehman commercial paper  inc 
the credit facilities provided for a seven year term loan in the amount of million and a five year revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
proceeds of the term loan were used to repay our prior senior credit facility 
on january   reddy group merged with its wholly owned subsidiary  reddy ice corporation  with reddy corp 
being the surviving entity 
the credit facilities were amended on that date to allow the merger and to provide for the assumption of the credit facilities by reddy corp 
at december   we had million of availability under the revolving credit facility  which was net of an outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
the standby letters of credit are used primarily to secure certain insurance obligations 
lehman commercial paper  inc lcp has a million commitment under the revolving credit facility  all of which is unfunded 
lcp filed for bankruptcy in october and we understand that lcp has failed to fund on other revolving credit facilities subsequent to filing for bankruptcy 
as a result  we believe lcp will likely not perform under the terms of the facility  which would effectively reduce the amount available to us under the revolving credit facility by million 
principal balances outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest per annum  at our option  at the sum of the base rate plus or libor plus 
the base rate is defined as the greater of the prime rate as announced from time to time by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate plus

in addition  our credit facilities will allow us to incur up to an additional million of incremental term loans under our credit facilities  subject to certain conditions 
no lenders have committed to provide the incremental term loans 
in the event that we incur incremental term loans that mature on or before the one year anniversary of the final maturity of the existing term loans and that bear interest with margins higher than the margin applicable to any term loans outstanding under our credit facilities  the margins applicable to the existing term loans will be increased to equal the margins applicable to the incremental term loans 
in the event that we incur incremental term loans that mature after the one year anniversary of the final maturity of the existing term loans and that bear 
table of contents interest with margins more than higher than the margins applicable to any term loans outstanding under our credit facilities  the margins applicable to the existing term loans will be increased to equal the margins applicable to the incremental term loans  less 
our credit facilities do not require any scheduled principal payments prior to the stated maturity dates 
subject to certain conditions  mandatory repayments of the revolving credit facility and term loan and if the term loan is no longer outstanding  mandatory commitment reductions of the revolving credit facility are required to be made with portions of the proceeds from asset sales  the issuance of debt securities and insurance and condemnation awards  subject to various exceptions 
in the event of a change in control  as defined in the credit facilities  an event of default will occur under the credit facilities 
our credit facilities contain financial covenants  which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios  as defined in the credit facilities  and are collateralized by substantially all of reddy corp 
s assets 
at december   reddy corp 
was in compliance with these covenants 
reddy holdings guarantees reddy corp 
s credit facilities and such guarantee is collateralized by a pledge of the capital stock of reddy corp

may also pay dividends to reddy holdings for certain other specified purposes  including the payment of cash dividends by reddy holdings to its stockholders and the payment of cash interest on our senior discount notes  in an amount not greater than our cumulative distributable cash for the period taken as one accounting period from july  to the end of our most recently ended fiscal quarter for which a covenant compliance certificate under our credit facilities has been delivered to the lenders 
as of december   the amount of cumulative distributable cash was million 
such dividends may only be paid if reddy corp 
s leverage ratio for the most recently ended fiscal quarter is less than or equal to to in addition  the credit facilities preclude reddy corp 
from declaring or paying such dividends if a default or event of default under the credit facilities has occurred and is continuing 
in particular  it will be an event of default if reddy corp 
s leverage ratio exceeds to or reddy corp 
s interest coverage ratio is less than to if at the end of any fiscal quarter  reddy corp 
s leverage ratio is greater than to  and therefore reddy corp 
is not permitted to pay dividends  reddy corp 
will be required by our credit facilities to apply of reddy corp 
s available cash generated during each such quarter to make a mandatory prepayment of the loans under our credit facilities 
if reddy corp

table of contents the following table presents adjusted ebitda for the twelve month period ended december  on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the adjustments permitted under the description of the definition of adjusted ebitda set forth above 
adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda that is derived solely from gaap components 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income loss  cash flows from operations or net cash from operating or investing activities as defined by gaap  and it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash needs as determined in accordance with gaap

interest rate hedging agreement 
effective september   we entered into an interest rate hedging agreement the hedge to fix the interest rate on a portion of our term loan facility 
the hedge has a term of three years and ten months and expires on july  the hedge had an initial notional balance of million 
the notional balance decreases by million on october of each of the next three years  beginning on october  as of december   the notional balance was million 
we pay a fixed rate of on the notional balance outstanding and receive an amount equal to month libor 
any net payable or receivable amount is settled quarterly 
as of december   the liability related to the hedge was million 
the hedge is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the fair value of the hedge is included in the caption derivative liability and deferred taxes and other liabilities  net in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and  respectively 
we are required to consider our own credit risk in the valuation of the hedge 
the amount of interest receivable as of december  and was included in the caption accounts receivable  net in the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded as other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
payments made or received under the hedge are included in the caption interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and in the operating activities section of the statements of cash flows 
for the next twelve months  the amount of other comprehensive income related to the hedge to be reclassified to earnings is million 
the hedge does not require any cash collateral from either us or the counterparty 
on february   we entered into two hedging arrangements to fix the interest rate on a portion of our term loan and fix the price per gallon of a substantial portion of our diesel fuel requirements 
the interest rate hedge began on february  and expires on december  and has notional balance of million from inception through july  and million from july  to december  we will pay a fixed rate of on the notional balance and receive an amount equal to month libor 
any net payable or receivable amount will be settled monthly 
the diesel hedge began february  and expires on december  the notional amount of gallons changes on a monthly basis to match our anticipated utilization 
we will pay a fixed rate of per gallon wholesale basis and receive an amount equal to a wholesale index rate 
any net payable or receivable amount will be settled monthly 
these hedging arrangements require us to provide cash collateral in a minimum amount of million 
we may have to provide additional cash collateral if the fair value of the hedges decreases as a result of changes in interest rates and diesel prices 
the terms of our credit facilities limit the amount of cash collateral we can provide to a maximum of million 
in the event the cash collateral requirements exceed this amount  we will be forced to unwind all or a portion of the hedges 
we are exposed to risk of loss in the event of non performance by the counterparty to its hedging arrangements 
we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparty  however recent dislocations in the credit markets have resulted in greater uncertainty regarding counterparty performance 

table of contents liquidity outlook 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  we record the majority of our revenues and profits during the months of may through september 
the majority of the cash generated from those operations is received between july and november 
we expect to fully utilize the excess cash generated from our selling season during the winter and spring of to fund our operations  debt service  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we currently estimate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million to million  which will primarily be used to maintain and expand our traditional ice operations 
in the normal course of our business  we dispose of obsolete  worn out and unneeded assets and have historically applied those funds against capital expenditures 
based on our expected level of operations  we believe that cash flows from operations  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
as of march   we had approximately million of cash on hand at reddy holdings  approximately million of cash at reddy corp 
and approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility  which reflected outstanding standby letters of credit of million and a million reduction based on the expected non performance by lcp of its commitment under our revolving credit facility 
during the next three months  we expect availability under our revolving credit facility will decrease due to borrowings on our revolving credit facility to fund operations  capital expenditures  debt service and acquisitions and anticipated letter of credit requirements 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are expected to occur in the spring as our cash flows from operations decline to their lowest point during march and april due to reduced sales in january and february and the need to finance seasonal increases in accounts receivable and inventories as temperatures and sales volumes begin to increase in april and may 
furthermore  we expect the outstanding balance of our standby letters of credit to increase to approximately million to million by the end of as a result of the need to provide collateral to secure operating lease financing  outstanding surety bonds and obligations to certain vendors 
we expect availability under our revolving credit facility to be no less than million at all times during as noted previously  we record the majority of our sales and any profits during the months of may through september and the majority of the cash generated from those operations is received in july through november  by which time  we expect to have repaid all amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility in the spring  fund current capital expenditures and debt service and build up cash balances 
we expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants over the next twelve months  however  in the event that we are in jeopardy of a dividend suspension period under reddy corp 
s credit facilities  or the margin of compliance with the leverage ratio financial covenant in reddy corp 
s credit facilities narrows  we could use a portion of our excess cash or revolving credit facility availability to pay down principal on the term loan to maintain compliance 
our revolving credit facility expires on august  we are managing our cash position and capital requirements over the next months to allow us to operate without the revolving credit facility after the expiration date 
we currently project having sufficient cash on hand at the end of to allow us to safely operate throughout  by which time we expect to refinance our indebtedness 
interest expense on our senior discount notes see senior discount notes  becomes payable in cash on a semi annual basis beginning may  the annual cash obligation for this interest is million 
expenses in connection with the antitrust investigations and related civil litigation may require the use of cash on hand at reddy holdings or reddy corp 
or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of march   our cash on at reddy holdings  net of accrued expenses related the antitrust investigations and related civil litigation  was approximately million 
based on the current status of the investigation and related civil litigation and projected expenses  we believe reddy holdings cash balance will be sufficient to fund these expenses for the next twelve months  however this expectation includes assumptions regarding matters beyond our control or knowledge 
if reddy 
table of contents holdings were to require additional cash to fund its expenses related to the antitrust investigations  reddy corp 
has the ability under the credit facility to transfer million to reddy holdings in each of and and reddy holdings is permitted to raise at least million in additional debt 
we are also evaluating our insurance coverage with regards to the costs of the investigations and related civil litigation and are working to maximize any potential reimbursements 
contractual obligations 
the table below summarizes the future payments due under our significant contractual obligations as of december  total to to and thereafter in millions long term debt operating leases purchase obligations uncertain tax positions total contractual obligations includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the debt 
consists of our obligation to purchase i  merchandisers and million of spare parts per year under a supply agreement that expires may  and ii million bags per year under a supply agreement that expires on december  due to the uncertainty related to the timing and reversal of uncertain tax positions  only the short term uncertain tax benefits have been provided in the table above 
the long term amounts excluded from the table above were approximately million 
general economic trends and seasonality our results of operations are generally affected by the economic trends in our market area 
we believe end users of our products use packaged ice in many applications  including recreational activities  the construction industry  agriculture and special events 
weakness in the national economy combined with other factors including inflation  interest rate fluctuations  increases in fuel and other energy costs  labor and healthcare costs and the availability of financing  may negatively impact consumer confidence and the business prospects of our commercial customers 
if consumer activities associated with the use of our products decline or the business activities of our commercial customers decrease  our revenues and sales volumes may decline 
our results to date have not been significantly impacted by inflation  other than costs directly related to energy prices  such as fuel  plastic bags and electricity 
if we experience high inflation in these costs in the future  or inflationary pressures have significant effects on other cost categories  we may not be able to pass on all of these higher costs to our customers in the short term 
we do believe that we will be able to pass on higher costs to our customers over longer periods of time  however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts 
the ice business is highly seasonal  with the bulk of demand coming in the warmer spring and summer months 
accordingly  we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and profitability 
we make a disproportionate amount of our sales in the second and third calendar quarters 
we also typically earn any net income in these same periods  whereas we typically experience net losses in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
we believe that approximately two thirds of our revenues will occur during the second and third calendar quarters when the weather conditions are generally warmer and demand is greater  while approximately one third of our revenues will occur during the first and fourth calendar quarters when the weather is generally cooler 
this belief is consistent with historical trends 
as a result of seasonal revenue declines and the lack of proportional corresponding expense decreases  we will most likely experience lower profit margins and losses during the first and fourth calendar 
table of contents quarters 
in addition  because our operating results depend significantly on sales during our peak season  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of adverse weather during this peak selling period if the weather is unusually cool or rainy on a more national or regional basis 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make the required payments on their accounts 
we have attempted to reserve for these estimated losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments on their accounts  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets 
property and equipment is carried at cost and is being depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated lives of to years for buildings and site improvements and to years for plant  equipment and machinery 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the assets useful life 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred  while capital improvements that extend the useful lives of the underlying assets are capitalized 
we accounted for all of our historical acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and as a result recorded significant amounts of goodwill 
other intangible assets include the following that are amortized over their useful lives intangible assets useful life goodwill indefinite life trade name indefinite life patent remaining legal life of years as of acquisition date customer relationships straight line method over economic lives of eight to years debt issue costs effective interest method over the term of the debt impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability of long lived assets and certain other identifiable intangible assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or its disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and other intangible assets that management expects to hold and use are based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is evaluated using a market valuation approach  based on valuations of comparable businesses  multiples of earnings of comparable businesses and discounted cash flows 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets are evaluated at each fiscal year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
at december   we considered the market value of our stock and other factors to evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets 
inherent in the determination of such future cash flows and valuations are certain estimates and judgments  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market values and 
table of contents assumptions about our strategic plans with regards to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusions regarding the impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method  which requires  among other things  recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and the recognition of available tax carryforwards 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when product packaged ice and ice packaging bags for ice factory units is delivered to and accepted by customers 
in  traditional ice manufacturing and distribution and ice factory operations accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
there is no right of return with respect to the packaged ice and bags delivered 
revenue resulting from management agreements for ice factories are recognized as earned under contract terms 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company selected the modified prospective method of adoption and therefore began recognizing stock based employee compensation cost related to all employee awards that were outstanding as of january  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions with employees  and carries forward without change prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb opinion and generally requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires us to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after adoption of the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that are outstanding on that date 
compensation expense is based primarily on the market value of our stock at the date of grant of the awards

fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes

table of contents fin was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we were required to record the impact of adopting fin as an adjustment to the january  beginning balance of retained earnings deficit 
adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
upon adoption of fin  our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million 
as a result of adoption  our liability for unrecognized tax benefits increased million 
this also resulted in a million increase to the january  balance of retained deficit  a million increase in deferred tax benefits related to the federal benefit of unrecognized tax positions and a million reclassification of amounts previously reserved at december  on june   the fasb reached consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our main market risk category is interest rate risk 
we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating interest rates under our senior credit facilities 
principal balances outstanding under the term loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest  at our option  at the london inter bank offered rate libor plus or the prime rate as announced from time to time by the administrative agent plus 
effective september   we entered into an interest rate hedging agreement the hedge to fix the interest rate on a portion of the term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources interest rate hedging agreement 
as of december   our credit facilities had an outstanding principal balance of million at a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
at december   the month libor rate was 
including the effect of the hedge  the weighted average interest rate of balances outstanding under the credit facilities was 
if libor were to increase by from that level  the annual increase in interest expense  given our principal balances at december  and the effect of the hedge  would be approximately million 
we are exposed to risk of loss in the event of non performance by the counterparty to our hedging arrangements 
we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparty  however recent dislocations in the credit markets have resulted in greater uncertainty regarding counterparty performance
