value at risk var disclosure of commodity price risk we measure commodity price risk in our energy services segment using a var methodology  which estimates the expected maximum loss of our portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval 
our var calculations are based on the monte carlo approach 
the quantification of commodity price risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance and to determine risk thresholds 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation 
inputs to the calculation include prices  volatilities  positions  instrument valuations and the variance covariance matrix 
historical data is used to estimate our var with more weight given to recent data  which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements 
we rely on var to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period 
while management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable  no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating var 
different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
our var exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized due to adverse commodity price movements in our energy services segment s portfolio of derivative financial instruments  physical commodity contracts  leased transport  storage capacity contracts and natural gas in storage 
a one day time horizon and a percent confidence level are used in our var data 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the var calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices  operating exposures and timing thereof  and the changes in our derivative financial instruments  physical contracts and natural gas in storage 
var information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodology s other limitations 
the potential impact on our future earnings  as measured by var  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following table details the average  high and low var calculations for the periods indicated 
years ended december  value at risk millions of dollars average high low our var calculation includes derivatives  executory storage and transportation agreements and their related hedges 
the variations in the var data are reflective of market volatility and changes in our portfolio during the year 
the increase in average var for  compared with  was primarily due to a significant increase in natural gas prices during the second quarter of our var calculation uses historical prices  placing more emphasis on the most recent price movements 
we revised our assumptions in the third quarter of to decrease the weight given to the most recent price changes and spread the relative weighting over more historical data 
this methodology reduces the effects of the market anomalies and better reflects an efficient market 
we believe this methodology is more reflective of portfolio risk and have applied the change on a prospective basis 
during  we also began calculating the var on our mark to market derivative positions  which reflects the risk associated with derivatives whose change in fair value will impact current period earnings 
these transactions are subject to mark to market accounting treatment because they are not part of a hedging relationship under statement var associated with these derivative positions was not material during to the extent open commodity positions exist  fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business  operating results or financial position 

table of contents interest rate risk general we are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and  at times  interest rate swaps 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates 
at december   the interest rate on percent of our long term debt  exclusive of the debt of our oneok partners segment  was fixed after considering the impact of interest rate swaps 
at december   the interest rate on all of oneok partners long term debt was fixed 
we terminated a million interest rate swap in the fourth quarter of the total value we received was million  which includes million of swap savings previously recorded 
the remaining savings of million will be recognized in interest expense over the remaining term of the debt instrument originally hedged 
in the fourth quarter of  our counterparties exercised the option to terminate two additional interest rate swap agreements totaling million 
the swap terminations were effective in december and january the total value we received for the terminated swaps was not material 
at december   a basis point move in the annual interest rate on all of our swapped long term debt would change our annual interest expense by million before taxes 
this basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
if interest rates changed significantly  we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change 
since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain  no change has been assumed 
fair value hedges see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for discussion of the impact of interest rate swaps and net interest expense savings from terminated swaps 
total net swap savings for were million  compared with million for total swap savings for are expected to be million 
currency exchange rate risk as a result of our energy services segment s operations in canada  we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk from our commodity purchases and sales related to our firm transportation and storage contracts 
to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  we use physical forward transactions  which result in an actual two way flow of currency on the settlement date since we exchange us dollars for canadian dollars with another party 
we have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment  therefore  the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are recorded in net margin 
at december  and  our exposure to risk from currency translation was not material 
we recognized a currency translation loss of million during and currency translation gains of million and million during and  respectively 
counterparty credit risk oneok and oneok partners assess the creditworthiness of their counterparties on an on going basis and require security  including prepayments and other forms of cash collateral  when appropriate
