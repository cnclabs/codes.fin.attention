item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page in this annual report on form k 
overview we manage and evaluate the operating results of our business in two segments franchise operations this segment consists of the operations of our franchise business  including royalty and marketing and advertising revenues  financial product fees and other revenues  and company owned office operations this segment consists of the operations of our company owned offices for which we recognize service revenues primarily for the preparation of tax returns 
revenues that we earn consist of the following components franchise operations revenues our standard franchise agreement is for a term of years 
in and  we offered our franchisees the opportunity to renew their franchise relationship with us before their franchise agreement expired 
these new agreements were for a new year term and approximately a third of these existing franchise agreements will come up for renewal in or we are currently working with elected representatives of our franchisee community on the development of a new franchise agreement and anticipate that this will be completed by september  the economic terms outlined below and other operating requirements may change in the new agreement 
royalty revenues we earn royalty revenues from our franchisees 
our current franchise agreements require franchisees to pay us a royalty fee of of their revenues for most territories sold before mid year 
in fiscal  our average royalty rate was 
franchisees earn revenues from the preparation of tax returns and from related products and services 
marketing and advertising revenues in addition to royalty revenues  franchisees pay us a marketing and advertising fee equal to of their revenues 
financial product fees we earn financial product fees primarily from financial institutions that collectively provide financial products  including refund anticipation loans  to the entire network of jackson hewitt tax service offices during the tax season in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we have agreements under which these financial institutions pay us a fixed fee to offer  process and administer such financial products through jackson hewitt tax service locations as well as variable payments upon the attainment of certain contractual growth thresholds 
these agreements expire on october  we earn financial product fees from a financial institution responsible for issuing and managing our prepaid debit card program and providing line of credit products related to the card 
fees earned are based on achieving certain levels of revenues and gross profits under the program 
we earn financial product fees in connection with our gold guarantee product  which is an extended warranty that a customer may purchase whereby the taxpayer may be reimbursed up to a set limit for any additional tax liability owed due to an error in the preparation of the customer s tax return 
other revenues other revenues include ancillary fees we earn from franchisees  including a fee per tax return paid by franchisees for the processing of each electronically transmitted tax return 
we recognize 
table of contents revenues from processing fees at the time the tax returns are filed 
in fiscal  over of all tax returns filed by our franchisees were filed electronically 
other revenues also include revenues that we earn from the sale or transfer of our franchise territories 
company owned office operations revenues service revenues service revenues include only revenues earned at our company owned offices and primarily consist of fees that we earn directly from our customers for the preparation of tax returns 
wal mart on march   we entered into an agreement with wal mart that grants us the exclusive right to provide tax preparation services within wal mart stores during the and tax seasons 
the wal mart agreement expires on may  and it may be renewed for three additional one year terms upon the mutual agreement of the parties 
the wal mart agreement contains certain early termination rights and indemnity obligations 
compensation to wal mart consists of fixed license fees for each wal mart store in which a jackson hewitt tax service office operates  additional fees based on the number of tax returns prepared by each office in the applicable tax seasons and additional fees based on the preparation and filing of tax returns through our on line tax preparation software  that we intend to introduce beginning in the tax season  for customers who accessed such on line tax preparation software via walmart 
com collectively  the fees 
franchised offices operating jackson hewitt tax service offices in wal mart stores pursuant to the wal mart agreement are obligated under their franchise agreements with us to reimburse us for all fees paid on their behalf to wal mart 
we have been involved with wal mart for many years prior to this exclusive agreement and it has historically represented a cost effective and efficient retail distribution channel from which to generate incremental tax returns 
in fiscal  approximately of the tax returns prepared by our network were generated in stores located in wal mart 
under our arrangement with wal mart  with an increased level of collaboration and an aggressive joint marketing and promotion plan  the overall wal mart opportunity  not just the incremental portion  offers substantial growth for us 
we are in the process of adding a significant number of new  incremental wal mart store locations for the tax season 
we expect that a majority of these locations will be run by our franchisees and the remaining locations will be part of our company owned operations 
we believe this exclusive arrangement will help grow our network and increase our revenues 
restructuring actions and other termination charges lease termination and related expenses as part of an overall effort to optimize company owned store locations and improve profitability  in fiscal  approximately under performing store locations were either closed  or we decided to exit in connection with our april restructuring action  which resulted in lease termination and related expenses of million 
employee termination expenses as part of an initiative to achieve a lower cost structure and in connection with other personnel changes  our overall consolidated workforce was reduced by approximately which resulted in employee termination expenses of million in fiscal management changes on june   the employment of michael c 
yerington  formerly our chief executive officer and president  was terminated 
upon termination  mr 
yerington also resigned as a director of our board 
on the same day  our board of directors announced that harry w 
buckley was appointed chief executive officer  president and a director on our board

foster  formerly our chief marketing officer  was terminated 
effective november   mark l

economic stimulus in february  president bush signed into law the economic stimulus act of the new law allowed a refundable credit against tax to low and middle income individuals for we prepared approximately  economic stimulus program esp tax returns in fiscal  which were tax returns filed by customers that had no legal requirement to file a tax return but filed a tax return solely to receive an economic stimulus payment from the irs 
we have presented certain tax return data excluding the impact of esp tax returns in order to help investors compare  on an equivalent basis  our financial results for fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal internal review on september   we reached an agreement with the irs resolving its examination of our internal tax return preparation compliance systems and processes 
in connection with closing the audit  we agreed to make a voluntary compliance payment of million 
in september  the department of justice doj announced that it had reached a settlement of the civil injunction suits it had filed in april against a franchisee and other named defendants operating in four states based upon allegations involving fraudulent tax return preparation doj lawsuits 
we were not named as a defendant in these suits 
in october  the franchisee named in the doj lawsuits exited the jackson hewitt system 
we retained outside counsel to conduct an internal review the internal review of the allegations set forth in the doj lawsuits and of our policies  practices and procedures in connection with such tax return preparation activities 
the internal review s examination determined that there was no corporate involvement in the allegations made against the franchisee 
it also resulted in recommendations which were implemented for the tax season and enhanced certain systems and processes  including the development of additional compliance requirements such as enhanced monitoring tools and increased training of franchisees and tax return preparers

table of contents we believe that a series of factors contributed towards impeding our ability to compete in the market place during the tax season 
as a result  we have engaged a management consulting firm to assist us with defining the root causes of our poor performance and to assist us in formulating a strategy that will set us on a path to sustainable improved performance 
an important part of the assessment process is determining the degree to which the following factors adversely affected our business in the tax season i our customers overall experience  ii our locations  iii our pricing  iv our overall marketing effectiveness  especially our local marketing  v online encroachment  and vi our early season product execution 
by better understanding which factors contributed most to our difficult tax season  we will be able to direct our attention and resources to improve our performance in the tax season 
an important element of our location strategy is that the maturation of our offices from which the average number of tax returns prepared per office increases as offices age 
our retail partner locations typically prepare fewer tax returns as they tend to be smaller in size than typical storefront locations 
due to the factors discussed above  the average number of tax returns prepared per office presented in the table below decreased in most age categories as compared to fiscal the following table includes  for fiscal  the average number of tax returns prepared by offices in our network  including the percentage of retail partner locations as a percentage of total offices by age category  based upon the number of years in our network number of years in our network offices as a of total offices retail partner locations as a of total offices by age average number of tax returns prepared per office total offices please see franchise results of operations and company owned office results of operations for additional highlights

liquidity and capital resources historical sources and uses of cash from operations seasonality of cash flows the tax return preparation business is highly seasonal resulting in substantially all of our revenues and cash flow being generated during the period from january through april following the tax season  from may through december  we primarily rely on excess operating cash flow from the previous tax season and our credit facility to fund our operating expenses and to reinvest in our business to support future growth 
given the nature of the franchise business model  our business is generally not capital intensive and has historically generated strong operating cash flow from operations on an annual basis 
credit agreement in february  we sought relief in connection with our consolidated leverage ratio financial covenant under our former amended and restated million credit facility in advance of the fiscal fourth quarter measurement date 
under our former amended and restated million credit facility  the consolidated leverage ratio financial covenant stepped down from to for the period ending april  during which our projections indicated that our fourth quarter ebitda would be insufficient to achieve compliance 
as a result  
table of contents in april  we amended our existing senior revolving credit facility the april amended and restated credit agreement primarily to provide for additional flexibility in connection with the allowable maximum consolidated leverage ratio under the credit facility covenants 
the april amended and restated credit agreement is a committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of banks with a maturity date of october  and is secured by all of our assets 
borrowings under the april amended and restated credit agreement are to be used to finance working capital needs  general corporate purposes  and potential acquisitions 
under the terms of the april amended and restated agreement  the principal amount available under the credit agreement was reduced from million to million and is comprised of an amortizing term loan of million and a revolving credit line of million 
the term loan amortization requires mandatory payments of million in april plus of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  if any  due in the first quarter of fiscal  million in april plus of excess cash flow  if any  due in the first quarter of fiscal  and payment of the remaining principal at maturity 
we believe we have the ability  and we have the intent  to refinance the million term loan payment due in april under our april amended and restated credit agreement and  therefore  have continued to classify this portion of the debt as a long term obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratio  which is the ratio of consolidated debt measured on a trailing four quarter basis to consolidated earnings before interest taxes  depreciation and amortization  was amended to be for the fiscal quarters ending april  through july   for the fiscal quarter ending october   for the fiscal quarter ending january   and for the fiscal quarters ending april  through july  the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  which is the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense  was amended to be greater than or equal to over the remaining term of the facility 
eurodollar borrowings now bear interest at libor plus a credit spread ranging from to  base rate borrowings now bear interest at the prime rate plus a spread of to and the facility now carries an annual fee ranging from to of the unused portion 
over the remaining term of the april amended and restated credit agreement  we are prohibited from paying dividends or repurchasing shares of our common stock  and we will be limited to acquisitions totaling million per year 
additionally  the credit facility contains various other customary restrictive covenants that limits our ability to  among other things  i incur additional indebtedness or guarantees  ii create liens or other encumbrances on our property  iii enter into a merger or similar transaction  iv sell or transfer property except in the ordinary course of business  and v make other restricted payments 
as of april   we were not aware of any instances of non compliance with such financial or restrictive covenants 
we believe that the commitment levels under our april amended and restated credit agreement will continue to support our ongoing operations and will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs during the next months 
in the future  we may require additional financing to meet our capital needs 
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the market in which we operate 
in addition  our inability to generate sufficient profits during tax season may unfavorably impact our funding requirements 
dividend on march   we announced that our board of directors had voted to suspend our per share quarterly common stock dividend 
this action will enable us to incrementally retain just over million per year 

table of contents credit market crisis the credit markets have been experiencing unprecedented volatility and disruption causing many lenders and institutional investors to cease providing funding to even the most credit worthy borrowers or to other financial institutions 
the credit crisis could limit the ability of our financial partners to fund  securitize or sell the financial products that are made available to our customers through our offices and negatively impact the ability of our lending syndicate to make funds available to us under our credit facility 
additionally in fiscal  the credit crisis adversely impacted our franchisees ability to grow and operate their businesses  including their ability to pay amounts due us 
as a result  we recorded a provision for uncollectible receivables of million in fiscal for additional information on how the credit market crisis may adversely affect our business and financial performance  please see item a risk factors 
sources and uses of cash operating activities in fiscal  we received million more cash for operations as compared to fiscal due to the following lower income tax payments of million primarily due to the decrease in operating income between years  the absence of million in payments associated with internal review expenses  lower bonus payments for full time and seasonal employees of million as we paid million in fiscal accrued in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal accrued in fiscal  the absence of a million severance payment to our former chief executive officer  who departed in october  and cash proceeds of million from an insurance recovery related to the settlement of the california attorney general and pierre brailsford matters 
partially offsetting the factors discussed above were lower fixed fees of million received under our agreements with our financial product providers  higher occupancy costs of million associated with maintaining a higher average number of company owned offices as a result of fiscal acquisitions  and higher external legal fee payments of million 
in fiscal  we received million less cash from operations as compared to fiscal due to the following lower franchise operations revenues primarily due to a decrease in the number of tax returns prepared and lower financial product fees  higher costs of approximately million associated with incremental labor and facilities to support the new company owned offices opened in fiscal  payments of million associated with the internal review primarily accrued in fiscal higher interest payments on our credit facility of million primarily due to increased borrowings  and payment of million in severance to our former chief executive officer  who departed in october

investing activities in fiscal  we used million less cash for investing activities as compared to fiscal due to lower cash paid for the acquisition of tax return preparation businesses of million and lower net funding provided to franchisees of million 
partially offsetting the overall decrease in net cash used in investing activities were higher capital expenditures of million primarily due to higher capitalized software development costs 
in fiscal  we used million more cash for investing activities as compared to fiscal due to higher cash paid for the acquisition of tax return preparation businesses of million and higher net funding provided to franchisees of million 
partially offsetting the overall increase in net cash used in investing activities were lower capital expenditures of million as fiscal included leasehold improvements and new equipment purchases associated with the relocation of our technology headquarters to a new building and lower capitalized software development costs 
financing activities in fiscal  we used million more cash from financing activities as compared to fiscal primarily due to a reduction of net borrowings under our credit facility of million  and the absence of million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options primarily by our former chief executive officer  who departed in october partially offsetting the above was the absence of million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in fiscal and the absence of a fourth quarter dividend payment in fiscal in fiscal  we used million less cash for financing activities as compared to fiscal primarily due to the following higher net borrowings under our credit facility of million  reduced spending of million on the repurchase of shares of our common stock  and higher proceeds of million resulting from the exercises of stock options 
partially offsetting the overall decrease in net cash used in financing activities were higher quarterly dividend payments to stockholders of million for which the quarterly payments were increased to per share in fiscal as compared to per share in fiscal future cash requirements and sources of cash future cash requirements over the next months  our primary cash requirements will be the funding of our operating activities including contractual obligations and commitments  capital expenditure requirements  acquisitions  the funding of franchisee office expansion  repaying debt outstanding  and making periodic interest payments on our debt outstanding  as described more fully below 
marketing and advertising we receive marketing and advertising payments from franchisees to fund our budget for most of these expenses 
marketing and advertising expenses include national  regional and local campaigns designed to increase brand awareness and attract both early season and late season customers 
such expenses are seasonal in nature and typically increase in our third and fourth fiscal quarters when most of our revenues are earned 

table of contents company owned offices our company owned offices complement our franchise system and are focused primarily on organic growth through the opening of new company owned offices within existing territories as well as increasing office productivity 
we also continue to pursue selective acquisition opportunities for our company owned office segment in economically attractive  high growth markets adjacent to our current operations 
under the terms of the april amended and restated credit agreement  we are limited to annual acquisitions of million 
expenses to operate our company owned offices begin to increase during the third fiscal quarter and peak during the fourth fiscal quarter primarily due to the labor costs related to the seasonal employees who provide tax return preparation services to our customers 
lease termination payments we anticipate spending approximately million in fiscal in connection with lease terminations accrued for in fiscal based on certain assumptions and if we are successful in buying out of these lease commitments 
capital expenditures we anticipate spending between million and million on capital expenditures in fiscal  nearly half of which will be related to kiosks purchased in support of our expanded wal mart opportunity 
the majority of the remaining capital expenditures are planned for information technology upgrades  including personnel related payments capitalized for the development of internal use software 
franchisee funding we anticipate providing franchisees with funding for conversions and to open new storefront offices as we look to build a stronger distribution system 
debt service as of june   we had million outstanding under our april amended and restated credit agreement 
under the terms of the april amendment  a mandatory payment of million is due in april in connection with the amortizing term loan of million 
additionally  we anticipate having to spend between million and million on interest in fiscal future sources of cash we borrow against our credit facility to fund operations with increases particularly during the first nine months of the fiscal year 
beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter  we expect our primary sources of cash to be royalty and marketing advertising fees from franchisees  service revenues earned at company owned offices and financial product fees 
we plan to target and will seek to maintain a capital structure that is consistent with a low investment grade credit profile  broadly modeled in the bbb area 
we have no near term intention to seek a formal credit rating  and  given our size  we may have difficulty receiving an investment grade rating from the major rating agencies  however we use this profile for guidance 
we believe that targeting this capital structure profile over the long term will result in an appropriate balance between the needs of equity and debt providers  between financial risk and financial flexibility for our company  while providing a prudent use of leverage to minimize jackson hewitt s weighted average cost of capital 
over the remaining term of the amended and restated credit agreement  we are not permitted to pay dividends or repurchase shares of common stock 
seasonality of operations given the seasonal nature of the tax return preparation business  we have historically generated and expect to continue to generate substantially all our revenues during the period from january through april in fiscal we earned of our revenues during this period 
we historically operate at a loss through the first eight months of each fiscal year  during which we incur costs associated with preparing for the upcoming tax season 
additionally  the aggregate net loss in the off season period historically has increased period over period as a result of our prior year office expansion in the company owned segment  anticipated growth in the business and the cumulative effect of our share repurchase programs on interest expense

c primarily consists of estimated fixed fees to be paid to wal mart for each wal mart store in which we anticipate that a jackson hewitt tax service office will be operated in during the and tax seasons 
compensation to wal mart also consists of additional fees based on the number of tax returns prepared by each office in the and tax seasons and additional fees based on the preparation and filing of tax returns through our on line tax preparation software for customers who accessed such on line tax preparation software via walmart 
com  neither of which amounts are quantifiable at this time and excluded in the above table 
franchised offices operating offices in wal mart stores are contractually obligated with us to reimburse us for all fixed fees and additional fees paid on their behalf by us to wal mart 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
the following critical accounting policies may affect reported results resulting in variations in our financial results both on an interim and fiscal year basis 
goodwill we have million in goodwill as of april  the recoverability of goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test based on the estimated fair value of our underlying businesses 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter  which coincides with the development of our five year strategic operating plan 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment when an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
significant management judgment is required in assessing whether goodwill is impaired 
the carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by specifically identifying and allocating all of our consolidated assets and liabilities to each reporting unit based on various methods we deemed reasonable 
fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using an income approach which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market and risks inherent in the 
table of contents business 
factors affecting these future cash flows include  but are not limited to  markets and market share  tax return sales volumes and prices  cost structure  and working capital changes 
estimates are also used for our weighted average cost of capital in discounting the projected future cash flows and our long term growth rates 
in addition to the income approach  we corroborated our results with the use of market multiples for comparable companies to our reporting units 
if our estimates of fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors  we may determine that an impairment charge is necessary 
such a non cash charge would be equal in amount to the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value and would be recognized as a component of operating income in the reporting period identified 
we consider historical experience and all available information at the time the fair value of our reporting units are estimated 
however  fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used by us to evaluate the impairment of our goodwill 
we concluded as of april  that the fair value exceeded the net carrying value for each of our reporting units  thereby indicating no impairment in fiscal other indefinite lived intangible assets we have million in indefinite lived intangible assets as of april  other indefinite lived intangibles  which consist of our trademarks  include reacquired rights under franchise agreements from acquisitions  and are recorded at their fair value as determined through purchase accounting 
our trademarks are reviewed for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter 
additionally  we review the recoverability of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable 
if the fair value of our trademarks is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
for purposes of impairment testing  we estimate fair value using the relief from royalty approach  which is an income based approach 
we evaluated our estimates  which are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  including a fair royalty rate  revenues from our five year strategic operating plan  our weighted average cost of capital and long term growth rate 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for our trademarks could result in an impairment 
such a non cash charge would be limited the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset and its fair value and would be recognized as a component of operating income in the reporting period identified 
we concluded as of april  that the fair value exceeded the carrying value of our trademarks  thereby indicating no impairment in fiscal accounting standards issued but not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r was effective for us as of may  and will be applied prospectively to business combinations that have an acquisition date on or after may  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp fas 
fsp fas defers the implementation of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the aspects that have been deferred by fsp fas were effective for us beginning may  the adoption of fsp fas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the intent of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r and other gaap 
fsp was effective for us beginning may  we will apply the fsp prospectively to intangible assets acquired 
in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf clarifies that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non forfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities 
as participating securities  these instruments should be included in the calculation of basic eps 
fsp eitf was effective for us beginning may  we have not historically granted share based payment awards that entitled their holders to receive non forfeitable dividends before vesting  therefore the adoption of this eitf is not expected to have any impact to us 
in may  the fasb issued fas  subsequent events 
fas establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
although there is new terminology  the standard is based on the same principles as those that currently exist in the auditing standards 
the standard  which includes a new required disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events  is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to convert a notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings into fixed rate debt  with the intention of mitigating the economic impact of changing interest rates 
under these interest rate swap agreements  the first million of which became effective in october and the remaining million in november  we receive a floating interest rate based on the three month libor in arrears and pay a fixed interest rate averaging from to 
these interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
 no 
and no 
in connection with extending the maturity date under the amended and restated credit facility in october  we entered into interest rate collar agreements to become effective after the initial interest rate swap agreements terminate 
the interest rate collar agreements were entered into with financial institutions to limit the variability of expense payments on million of floating rate borrowings during the period from july to october to a range of the cap and the floor 
these interest rate collar agreements were determined to be cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended 
we have financial market risk exposure related primarily to changes in interest rates 
as discussed above  we attempt to reduce this risk through the utilization of derivative financial instruments 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate on our floating rate borrowings outstanding as of april   excluding our million of hedged borrowings whereby we fixed the interest rate  at an average ranging from to  would result in an annual increase or decrease in income before income taxes of million 
the estimated increase or decrease is based upon the level of variable rate debt as of april  and assumes no changes in the volume or composition of debt
