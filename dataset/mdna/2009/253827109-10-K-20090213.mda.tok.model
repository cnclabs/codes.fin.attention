table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth previously under the caption risk factors 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of diagnostic imaging products and personnel and equipment leasing services that improve patient care while driving positive healthcare economics 
we designed and commercialized the first solid state nuclear gamma camera for the detection of cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions 
our imaging systems are portable as well as fixed  and provide enhanced operability  improved patient comfort and  in the case of our triple headed cardius xpo system  shorter image acquisition time when compared to traditional vacuum tube cameras 
our nuclear cameras fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures in a physician s office  an outpatient hospital setting or within multiple departments of a hospital 
we generate revenues within two primary operating segments our personnel and equipment leasing service business digirad imaging solutions  or dis and our product segment 
through dis  we offer a comprehensive personnel and equipment leasing services program as an alternative to purchasing a gamma camera or ultrasound machine for physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging  echocardiography  vascular ultrasound  or any combination of these procedures in their offices by leasing the imaging system  certified personnel and other support required to perform imaging in the physician s office 
the flexibility of our products and our dis leasing service allows physicians more control over the diagnosis and treatment of their patients in their offices and to retain revenue from procedures they would otherwise refer elsewhere 
dis leasing services are primarily provided to cardiologists and internists who enter into annual contracts for personnel and equipment services delivered on a per day basis 
our typical lease contracts provide service coverage ranging from once per month to three times per week 
we experience some seasonality in our dis business related to summer vacations  holidays and inclement weather  which historically has most negatively affected our third quarter 
our product revenue results primarily from selling solid state gamma cameras and from the sale of camera maintenance contracts 
we sell our imaging systems to physician offices  hospitals  and imaging centers primarily in the united states  although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally 
our market the target market for our products and services is comprised of approximately  cardiologists   internists and family practitioners  and hospitals in the united states that perform or could perform nuclear cardiac and ultrasound procedures 
as of december   we have provided imaging services through dis to more than physicians and physician groups 
we have sold cameras through our product segment 
more than half of our dis nuclear and ultrasound imaging customers are internists or other primary care practitioners  and the remainder are cardiologists 
we believe our market has been negatively affected by declining reimbursements from medicare and medicaid programs  pricing pressures  and continuing efforts by some third party payors to reduce health care expenditures by requiring physicians to obtain specific accreditations or certifications  or disallowing reimbursement if imaging is performed with portable or leased cameras 
we expect each of these trends to continue 
trends and drivers the medical device industry  including the market for nuclear and ultrasound imaging systems and services  is highly competitive 
our business continues to be negatively affected by many factors  including declining healthcare reimbursement rates for cardiac imaging procedures  competition from alternative imaging modalities such as ct angiography  and declining average selling prices for our product offerings 

table of contents we implemented a new sales approach in our dis business beginning in which is based on formalized co marketing agreements with prominent academic or regional medical centers of influence coi 
our coi strategy pairs an influential medical institution with community based physicians in an effort to extend quality diagnostic capabilities to their patients  with an expected result of improved patient care 
this approach  as well as the expansion of our ultrasound imaging revenues brought about through the acquisition of ultrascan  inc ultrascan in may  contributed to our increase in revenues compared to the prior year 
we expect our coi strategy to be the key driver to expand our market share 
in the product segment  we were able to attain profitability in for the first time in our history as a result of revenue growth and lower costs from outsourcing and other cost control initiatives 
we increased visibility and sales through an expanded dealer network and a more experienced direct sales team 
the majority of our camera sales growth in came from selling more portable cameras compared to prior year 
we expanded our target market focus in to include hospitals and large physician practices  resulting in key camera placements at some important luminary centers and prominent cardiology practices 
we gained market share by leveraging our new cardius xpo series featuring fourth generation solid state detectors  lb 
patient imaging capacity  nspeed rapid imaging protocols and compact footprint 
our primary focus for is to improve both our profitability and our cash flow results 
to this end  we initiated a restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of to create greater efficiency in dis by selling or closing underperforming locations 
this is  combined with flattening the management structure  expected to result in a more profitable core dis footprint that can be leveraged with our coi strategy 
we anticipate improving our approach to launching and growing centers of influence during in our product segment  we will invest in our technology platform designed to attract new customer segments 
in the short term  we believe we can build on achievements by introducing new products targeted specifically at the larger physician practices and hospital market segments 
these initiatives are intended to drive the company towards consistent profitability and cash flow 
highlights our consolidated revenues were million during  which represented an increase of million  or  over the prior year  driven by an increase in imaging services revenue in our dis segment  as well as increases in camera sales and maintenance contract revenues in our product segment 
dis revenue increased million  or  as a result of an increase in ultrasound imaging services revenue 
in the product segment  revenue increased million  or  as a result of increased gamma camera sales and maintenance contract revenues 
our dis business currently operates in states and the district of columbia 
as of december   dis operated nuclear gamma cameras and ultrasound imaging systems  compared to nuclear gamma cameras and ultrasound imaging systems as of december  we believe we can improve our overall profitability by improving the utilization of our fleet of gamma cameras and ultrasound machines 
we measure efficiency by tracking system utilization  which is measured based on the percentage of days that our nuclear and ultrasound imaging machines are used to deliver services to customers out of the total number of days that they are available to deliver such services 
system utilization decreased to in  compared to for the same period in we continue to obtain additional hub accreditation to respond to the reimbursement requirements of some third party payors 
as of december   we had obtained accreditation from the intersocietal commission for the accreditation of nuclear medicine laboratories icanl for of our dis hub locations requiring accreditation 
we also recently received accreditation for our ultrasound imaging services through the intersocietal commission for the accreditation of echocardiography laboratories icael 
as more and more payors require independent accreditation  we are well positioned to meet these reimbursement demands 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results from operations  expressed as percentages of total revenues for the years ended december    and revenues dis product total revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization and impairment of intangible assets goodwill impairment loss restructuring loss total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net net loss comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year  driven by an increase in imaging services revenue in our dis segment  as well as increases in camera sales and maintenance contract revenues in our product segment 
dis revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues for  which is consistent with prior years 
we expect dis revenue to continue to represent the larger percentage of our consolidated revenue in future periods 
dis 
our dis revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributed to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of ultrascan  inc ultrascan  a provider of ultrasound imaging systems and services to physicians offices and hospitals  in may  which enabled us to generate revenue from ultrasound imaging services 
in response to continued operating losses  management initiated a realignment of its imaging business in the fourth quarter of this plan includes the sale or closure of underperforming dis hub locations  which we believe will enable our management team to better focus on our centers of influence 
we expect this change to result in a reduction of revenues beginning in the first quarter of in addition  revenue is expected to fluctuate throughout the year based on seasonality stemming from physician vacations  holidays and inclement weather 
product 
our product revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of gamma cameras sold in to systems compared to sold in the prior year and an increase in maintenance contract revenues to million in from million in the prior year due to the expansion of our installed base of gamma cameras 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience pricing pressures on our gamma cameras due to increased competition in our market 

table of contents gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for  representing a decrease of million  or  over the prior year 
this decrease is primarily related to rising costs of revenues in the dis segment 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from for dis

dis gross profit was million for  which represents a decrease of million  or  over the prior year  primarily due to the overall increase in labor  depreciation and other servicing costs 
depreciation costs increased due to our investment in the upgrade of our dis portable fleet  which was completed during the second quarter of our dis portable fleet consists primarily of cameras available for lease 
dis gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from for product 
costs of goods sold is primarily comprised of materials  labor and overhead associated with the manufacturing and warranty of our products 
warranty costs are charged to cost of revenues in the period our cameras are sold and are based on our historical experience with failure rates and repair costs 
product gross profit increased to million for  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in product sales 
product gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for from for operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our products 
the primary costs are salaries and fringe benefits  development material costs  facility and overhead costs  consulting fees and nonrecurring engineering costs 
research and development expenses were million for  which represents a decrease of million  or  over the prior year 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs 
research and development expenses were and of product revenue for and  respectively 
we expect to continue to invest in research and development as we improve our existing technology and introduce new products to address the needs of large cardiology practices and hospitals 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  travel  marketing  and collateral materials and tradeshow costs 
sales and marketing expenses were million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year  principally as a result of additional personnel costs  consistent with the increase in revenues in both the dis and product segments 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue for compared to for we expect to reduce our sales and marketing expenses through a reduction in personnel costs in connection with the restructuring plan approved in the fourth quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for finance and accounting  human resources and other personnel  as well as legal and other professional fees and insurance 
general and administrative expenses were million for  which was essentially unchanged compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue for compared to for we expect to reduce general and administrative expenses via a number of cost reduction initiatives in addition to the restructuring plan approved in the fourth quarter of goodwill impairment loss 
the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan in may resulted in the recording of goodwill 
among other assets  goodwill was recorded within a reporting unit in our dis segment on the date of the acquisition  and represented the excess between the purchase price and the net assets acquired 
during our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the assets held by the reporting unit  which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of million 
no impairment losses were recorded in the prior year 

table of contents restructuring loss 
we initiated a restructuring plan to enhance company profitability in the fourth quarter of the initiatives include plans to sell  close  and consolidate certain dis hub locations during the first quarter of in order to focus on hub locations that benefit from our centers of influence model 
these sales and closures involve the sale or abandonment of property and equipment and staff reductions at the hub locations impacted by the restructuring plans  as well as the reduction of certain management positions 
the loss on property and equipment make up million of the million loss recorded in the remaining loss of million primarily represents severance payments 
no losses pertaining to restructuring efforts were recorded in the prior year 
other income the decrease of million in other income reflects decreasing market yields  the lower levels of average cash and investments balances in compared to as a result of cash used to upgrade the dis fleet and acquire assets from ultrascan 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over  primarily as a result of higher dis revenues attributable to the introduction of ultrasound imaging services 
dis revenue accounted for of total revenues for  compared to for dis 
our dis revenue was million for  which represents an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of the ultrasound imaging services revenue generated from the assets recently acquired from ultrascan 
this increase was partially offset by our decision to discontinue the sale of stress agents  which contributed to million in revenue in and did not contribute to any revenue in product 
our product revenue was million for  representing a decrease of million  or  over the prior year 
the decrease in product revenue is attributable to a decline in the average selling prices for our gamma cameras  partially offset by increasing maintenance contract revenues 
gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for  representing an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in consolidated gross profit was principally generated from ultrasound imaging services 
the increase was also the result of our efforts to improve operational efficiencies  as well as lower material and supply costs 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for from for dis 
cost of dis revenue increased to million for  representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year  primarily generated from ultrasound imaging services  and offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs associated with our decision to discontinue the sale of stress agents 
historically  the pharmaceutical costs approximated their sales value  resulting in almost no profit on these sales 
dis gross profit increased to million for  which represents an increase of million  or

cost of goods sold was million for  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
product gross profit increased to million for  which represents an increase of million  or 
product gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for from for product margin improvement is due to a reduction in material costs and an improvement in operating efficiency gained from increased camera volumes as units were manufactured and placed into dis as part of our dis camera fleet upgrade program 

table of contents operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses were million for  which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year 
this was primarily attributable to a reduction in the average number of research personnel from to people and decreased spending on indirect materials associated with new product development 
research and development expenses were of product revenue for compared to for sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million for  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year

sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue for compared to for general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year as a result of lower personnel related expenses  legal and recruiting costs and a reduction in spending on outside services 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue for compared to for other income other income consists primarily of interest income  net of interest and other expenses 
the decrease in other income reflects the lower levels of average cash and investments balances in compared to  primarily due to the acquisition of ultrascan s net assets 
liquidity and capital resources general we require capital principally for capital expenditures and working capital to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of dis nuclear cameras  ultrasound machines  vans  and computer hardware and software 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current securities available for sale of million 
we currently invest our cash reserves in money market funds  us treasury  government and corporate debt securities 
based upon our current level of expenditures  we believe our current working capital  together with cash flows from operating activities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures and working capital for at least the next months 
net cash provided by operations totaled million in due to cash flow from net income before non cash charges such as goodwill impairment  restructuring loss  and depreciation 
in addition  we reduced our net inventory levels during as we focused on purchasing processes and outsourcing initiatives 
we experienced a decrease in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments and reduction in headcount 
net cash used by investing activities amounted to million in primarily due to purchases of property and equipment to complete the upgrade of our dis portable fleet 
the purchases of property and equipment were partially offset by net maturities of securities available for sale 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to approximately million in  and represents the repayment of capital lease obligations  net of proceeds arising from the exercise of stock options 
on february   our board of directors authorized a stock buyback program to repurchase up to an aggregate of million of our issued and outstanding common shares 
the timing of stock repurchases and the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased will be made in compliance with rule b under the securities exchange act of the timing and extent of the repurchase will depend upon market conditions  applicable legal and contractual requirements  and other factors 

table of contents the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan may require additional consideration of cash and common stock of up to million to be paid to the seller or its designees in the event that certain financial milestones are achieved over the next three years 
debt service as of december   we had capital lease obligations totaling million 
these obligations are secured by the specific equipment financed under each lease and will be repaid monthly over the lease terms  which range from one to months 
our dis subsidiary entered into the majority of these capital lease obligations 
we are committed to making future cash payments on capital leases including interest and operating leases 
we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition and inventory valuation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from providing in office services to support the performance of cardiac imaging procedures and from selling and servicing solid state digital gamma cameras 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  when all of the following four criteria are met a contract or sales arrangement exists  products have been shipped and title has transferred or services have been rendered  the price of the products or services is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sab sets forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title and risk of loss  the need for installation  and customer acceptance 
these factors and the specific terms of each contract or sales arrangement are considered when revenue is recognized 
dis revenue is derived from the leasing of personnel and equipment for in office nuclear and ultrasound imaging procedures 
revenue related to imaging services is recognized at the time services are performed and 
table of contents collection is reasonably assured 
dis services are generally billed on a per day basis under annual contracts  which specify the number of days of service to be provided  or on a flat rate month to month basis 
product revenues are generated from the sales of gamma cameras and follow on maintenance service contracts 
we generally recognize revenue upon delivery to customers 
we also provide installation and training for camera sales in the united states 
installation and training is generally performed shortly after delivery and represents a relatively insignificant cost  which we accrue at the time revenue is recognized 
neither service is essential to the functionality of the product 
maintenance services are sold beyond the term of the warranty  which is generally one year from the date of purchase 
revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the obligation and is included in product sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
reserves for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments historically  the need to estimate reserves for accounts receivable has been limited to our dis business 
we provide reserves for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts 
dis adjustments and credit memos are adjustments for billing errors that are normally adjusted within the first days subsequent to the performance of service 
we review reserves on a quarterly basis and make adjustments based on our historical experience rate and known collectibility issues and disputes 
we also consider our bad debt write off history 
our estimates of collectibility could be impacted by material amounts by changed circumstances  such as a higher number of defaults or material adverse changes in a payor s ability to meet its obligations 
the provision for billing adjustments is charged against dis revenues and the provision for doubtful accounts is charged to general and administrative expenses 
our risk of material loss is mitigated as we only have a small number of customer accounts that have receivable balances in excess of  inventory we state inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we review our inventory balances quarterly for excess or obsolete inventory levels 
except where firm orders are on hand  we consider production inventory quantities in excess of the next months demand as excess and reserve for them at of cost 
service inventory in excess of months demand is likewise reserved at of cost 
we establish obsolescence reserves at for obsolete products 
we review the reserve quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
we rely on historical information to support our reserve and utilize management s business judgment 
once the inventory is reserved  we do not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold 
valuation of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets long lived assets consist of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets 
we record property and equipment at cost  and record other intangible assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we calculate depreciation on property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
we calculate amortization on other intangible assets using either the accelerated or the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets  based on the nature of when we expect to receive cash inflows generated by the intangible assets 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

the scope of sfas no 
includes long lived assets  or groups of assets  to be held and used as well as those which are to be disposed of by sale or by other method 
sfas no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to 
table of contents be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
we perform an annual review of the carrying value of our long lived assets to be held and used  including certain identifiable intangible assets  during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
on december   our board of directors approved restructuring initiatives in order to enhance company profitability  which included the sale or abandonment of property and equipment held at certain dis hub locations 
property and equipment held at these locations have been impaired or reclassified as held for sale 
the associated losses on these assets are included in the restructuring loss included in loss from operations on our income statement 
the impairment losses were derived based on the estimated fair values of the assets  which were based on anticipated cash inflows generated from the sale or use of the assets 
assets that were reclassified as held for sale are reflected as current assets on our balance sheet 
valuation of goodwill on may   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of ultrascan  inc ultrascan  a provider of ultrasound imaging systems and services to physicians offices and hospitals 
the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan resulted in the recording of goodwill  which represented the excess between the purchase price and the net assets acquired 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the provisions of sfas no 
require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill to the carrying value of its long term assets 
if the carrying value of the long term assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test  whereby the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to its implied fair value 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded 
due to a significant decline in our market capitalization during the year  we determined that it was necessary to perform the second step of the impairment test 
we determined the implied fair value of goodwill utilizing the discounted cash flow method under the income approach as well as the market approach 
we concluded that the implied fair value is million  resulting in a million impairment loss  which is included in loss from operations on our statement of operations 
restructuring restructuring costs are recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
and are included in loss from operations on our income statement 
restructuring loss for the year ended december  is comprised of losses on the abandonment of property and equipment and assets held for sale  one time termination benefits for involuntarily terminated employees  and obligations pertaining to abandoned property leases 
losses on property and equipment were recorded consistent with our accounting policy related to long lived assets  described above 
one time termination benefits are recorded at the time they are communicated to the affected employees 
losses on property lease obligations are recorded when the lease is abandoned 
share based payments we grant options to purchase our common stock and restricted stock units rsus to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
these options are share based payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r 
we adopted sfas r on january   using the modified prospective method 
under this method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the provisions of sfas r apply only to awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of the stock option awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model on the date of grant 
the fair value of 
table of contents rsus is based on the stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of equity instruments that are expected to vest are recognized using the straight line method over the requisite service period 
the fair value of stock options is derived using the following assumptions  some of which are subjective by nature 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes merton model for the year ended december  were years for the expected term  for the expected volatility  for the risk free rate and for dividend yield 
the weighted average expected option term for  and reflects the application of the simplified method set out in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all options 
we utilized this approach as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock 
in  we also used the historical volatility of comparable companies to determine the expected volatility of our stock 
we estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical data for forfeitures and we are recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
we have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we applied apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  to account for our equity compensation plans as permitted by sfas r 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees was determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
those amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and were amortized  on an accelerated basis  as a non cash charge to cost of revenues and operations over the vesting period of the options 
warranty we generally provide a month warranty on our gamma cameras 
we accrue the estimated cost of this warranty at the time revenue is recorded and charge warranty expense to product cost of revenues 
warranty reserves are established based on historical experience with failure rates and repair costs and the number of systems covered by warranty 
warranty reserves are depleted as gamma cameras are repaired 
the costs consist principally of materials  personnel  overhead and transportation 
we review warranty reserves quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the return on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income
