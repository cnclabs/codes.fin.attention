overview west marine is one of the largest boating supply retailers in the world with net revenues of million 
net loss in was million  including a million pre tax charge for store closures and other restructuring costs  a million non cash  pre tax charge for impairment of long lived assets and the impact of a million charge to provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
our business strategy is to offer an assortment of competitively priced merchandise for the boat and for the boater that meets the needs of individual boaters and boating businesses  provides great customer experiences and offers the convenience of multi channel shopping 
we have three reportable segments stores  port supply  and direct sales 
our stores segment generated approximately of our net revenues 
our company owned stores open at the end of are located in states  puerto rico and canada 
in addition  we have one franchised store in turkey 
our port supply segment is one of the largest wholesale distributors of marine equipment in the united states 
products shipped to port supply customers directly from our warehouses represented approximately of our net revenues 
our direct sales segment  which includes our internet and catalog operations  offers customers around the world more than  products and it accounted for the remaining of our net revenues 
our fiscal financial results reflected continued weakness in revenues stemming from reduced boating activity  and weakness and uncertainty in the economy in general 
as we experienced worsening market conditions and lower than expected sales levels early in the year  we announced a series of restructuring and cost reduction initiatives to improve our economic performance in the shorter term  while maintaining our ability to 
table of contents deliver future growth 
we estimate the annualized pre tax profit improvement resulting from the following restructuring and cost reduction initiatives to be approximately million to million 
store closures we increased our store closures to  as part of restructuring activities and eight due to our real estate optimization strategy 
our real estate optimization strategy moves us toward having fewer  larger stores with better economics and a larger footprint to better meet our customers needs with a broader and more specialized assortment of merchandise 
distribution center closure in  we closed one of our three distribution centers located in hagerstown  maryland 
the closure of our maryland distribution center reflected not only our reduced supply chain requirements due to lower sales  but also the improvements we made in managing our inventory 
in addition to the operational cost benefits derived from transitioning from three to two distribution centers  we realized a one time cash savings due to the elimination of duplicate stock levels associated with replenishing goods to our sales channels from this additional location 
call center closure we closed our largo  florida call center and transitioned to a new on line call center technology that allows most of our sales  technical  and customer service associates to work from home  or in what we call our virtual call center 
we do continue to have some call center associates housed in our support center in watsonville  california 
we expect the virtual call center format will provide improved customer service and long term cost savings 
port supply we implemented changes in our port supply wholesale segment designed to increase profitability  including modifications to our in store wholesale pricing model  additional account qualification requirements  and a restructuring of our external and internal sales functions  support functions and delivery services 
store operations and other support departments we have continued to focus on re engineering and simplifying processes  restructuring our internal organizations  and prioritizing activities with a careful eye towards maximizing return on investment 
we continue to focus on key initiatives designed to position west marine for sustained  long term growth and profitability  and we remain committed to controlling our expense structure

this compares to a net loss for of million  which included a million non cash  pre tax charge for impairment of goodwill  million non cash  pre tax charge for impairment of long lived assets and million non cash  pre tax charge for store closures and other restructuring costs 
the year ended january  was a week fiscal period 
the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the additional week was immaterial 
segment revenues net revenues for the stores segment decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to a million  or  decrease in comparable store sales and an million decrease attributable to store closures in and partially offsetting the sales decreases was an million increase from new stores opened in and we do not expect improvements in the overall economy for and we expect sales to decline at roughly the same pace we experienced in we expect to open a small number of stores in new markets and to close underperforming stores when the economics are favorable 
we will also continue to pursue opportunities to consolidate multi store markets with larger square footage stores 
port supply net revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to increased revenues to port supply customers through our store locations which are included in stores revenues 
across the port supply business stores and warehouse  we saw lower sales year over year to two customer types  boat dealers and boat builders 
we believe these customers are being negatively impacted by the challenging economic environment and credit crisis 
we expect this decline to continue through fiscal net revenues from our direct sales segment decreased million  or  to million  due to decreased revenues from our call center channel 
the decrease from the call center channel was partially offset by increased internet revenues 
the overall decline in this segment was driven by lower domestic sales  partially offset by higher sales from some international markets 
we do not expect that the international sales growth experienced last year will necessarily continue 
at a fundamental level  we believe that the weakness in the economy has had  and will continue to have  a depressing effect on our revenues  with corresponding risks to our earnings and cash flow 
we believe our customer traffic and sales are most closely tied to boat usage  which is a discretionary spending item 
as consumers have to make economic tradeoffs  we believe that spending on boating related activities is being reduced 
there are a number of steps we are taking to respond to lower sales expectations  to ensure orderly management of the business and to preserve our financial strength to survive the current downturn  with the ultimate goal being to maximize opportunities when the marketplace recovers 
the common theme has been to reduce expenses and maximize cash flow 
two initiatives through which we are accomplishing this are the restructuring that was executed in eg  store  distribution center and call center closings  as well as overhead expense reductions discussed above  and the conservative budget put into place for  which focuses on expense control and cash management designed to deliver positive cash flow  debt reduction and higher inventory turnover despite continued negative sales trends 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for the week period ending january  decreased in by  or million  compared to the week period ending december  comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were  and  respectively 
as compared to the corresponding week period ended january   comparable store sales decreased 
the decline in comparable store sales reflects lower sales of higher priced discretionary items and lower in store 
table of contents traffic levels throughout the year 
sales of usage based products  such as fishing and watersports equipment  declined at a rate greater than the overall comparable store trend  which we believe is indicative of reduced boating activity 
the overall comparable store trends were consistent across the country and we do not expect them to improve until there is a general improvement in the economy 
we expect consumers to continue to reduce spending on both discretionary and needs based boating supplies and anticipate that comparable store sales decline in will be greater than gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for gross profit decreased primarily due to lower sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  a decrease of basis points compared to in gross profit was lower as a percentage of revenues by basis points due to occupancy expense 
occupancy is our largest fixed expense and its impact on gross margin is largely driven by sales results and the fixed nature of the expense 
vendor allowances de leveraged  down basis points  because of the reduced purchases for in line with lower sales and reduced inventory 
buying and distribution also contributed to the decline as a percentage of revenues  down basis points 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for and increased as a percentage of revenues to in  a basis point increase  compared to in the impact of expense controls implemented in  combined with lower variable expenses driven by lower revenues  resulted in a million decrease 
decreased expenses associated with stores closed in drove a further million reduction 
expenses were also lower due to lower management bonuses with a year over year reduction of million in and million paid to our former chief executive officer as severance compensation in fiscal lower expenses were partially offset by million in unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments 
store closure and other restructuring costs in  we anticipated closing a small number of stores  which we originally estimated to be in the range of to locations 
these closures were primarily due to relocation  or consolidation of smaller stores into fewer  larger stores to better serve our markets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we conducted a more detailed analysis of store operations  particularly in light of deteriorating boating market conditions  and concluded that additional underperforming stores should be closed 
during the year we closed stores spread across several major boating markets 
these stores were identified as having no reasonable expectation of significant positive cash flow over the near term 
during the third quarter of  as part of the business restructuring effort  management decided to close our distribution center located in hagerstown  maryland  and our call center located in largo  florida 
we recognized restructuring expenses of million consisting of million for store closures  million for port supply  million for the distribution center  million for the call center  and severance costs of million for reductions in force at our watsonville  california support center 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets impairment of long lived assets was million in fiscal  compared to million impairment charges for the impairment was primarily due to impaired stores 
the impairment charge of million was for impairment of store and information technology assets 

table of contents interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to both lower interest rates and lower average outstanding bank borrowings in fiscal  compared to fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a provision of  compared to a benefit of in the change in our effective tax rate was due to management s decision to establish a full valuation allowance of million on the net deferred tax assets 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues for were million  compared to net revenues of million for net loss for was million  including a million pre tax  charge for goodwill impairment  compared to a net loss for of million  including a million pre tax  charge for store closures and other restructuring costs and a million pre tax charge for impairment of long lived assets 
segment revenues net revenues for the stores segment decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to a million revenue decline attributable to the closure of certain underperforming stores during and an million decrease in comparable store sales 
additionally  revenues declined million due to stores closed in and million due to our reduced participation in events outside of store locations 
partially offsetting the revenue decreases was a million increase from new stores opened in port supply revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to increased revenues to port supply customers through our store locations  which are included in stores sales 
net revenues of our direct sales segment increased million  or  to million  due to million in increased revenues from our internet channel 
the increase from the internet channel was partially offset by reduced call center revenues 
comparable store sales comparable store sales decreased in by  or million 
comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
the decline in comparable store sales reflects the softer sales of higher priced discretionary items and lower in store traffic levels extending into the peak part of the boating season  which we believe is indicative of reduced boat usage 
these trends were particularly evident in florida  which is a key boating market 
gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in  a decrease of basis points compared to in gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to occupancy expense 
occupancy is our largest fixed expense and its impact on gross margin is largely driven by revenue results  and while occupancy expense decreased million  or  the fixed nature of the expense deleveraged gross margin by basis points due to the year over year decline in revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  compared to and increased as a percentage of revenues to in  a basis point increase  compared to in 
table of contents the full year impact of the expense reductions associated with the store closure initiative  as well as other expense controls implemented in  contributed basis points toward improved selling  general and administrative expense 
these expense improvements were partially offset by expenses of million associated with the ongoing sec investigation and million paid to our former chief executive officer as severance compensation 
goodwill impairment we updated our analysis and evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment as of december  due to fourth quarter changes in future cash flow expectations  market values of guideline companies and other factors used for impairment testing 
we re tested goodwill and determined that the carrying amount of its net assets exceeded fair value 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge related to goodwill of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and as of fiscal year end  we had no goodwill on the balance sheet 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
store closure and other restructuring costs store closure and other restructuring costs decreased by million to million in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal in  we closed stores  including underperforming stores that we had identified as having no reasonable expectation of significant positive cash flow over the near term 
additionally  we consolidated most call center operations in our largo  florida facility 
in  we reevaluated the facility closing costs for four stores of the underperforming stores closed in because we were continuing to fulfill lease payment obligations and were not successful in subleasing locations in the timeframe we originally anticipated 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets impairment of long lived assets was million in the fiscal  compared to million impairment for fiscal in  we incurred a non cash charge of million for store assets whose carrying value was greater than their expected undiscounted future cash flows  offset by a million deferred rent adjustment  for a net impairment charge of million 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower inventory levels than the prior year which drove reduced bank borrowings 
income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of  compared to a benefit of in the lower benefit rate in was primarily attributable to the non deductible portion of goodwill impairment changes  which reduced tax benefits by million 
in addition  during we recorded valuation allowances against our california enterprise zone credit and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we ended with million of cash  an increase from million at the end of working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  decreased to million at the end of  compared with million at the end of the decrease in working capital was primarily driven by lower inventory year over year of million 
neither our access to  nor the value of  our cash equivalents has been materially affected by the recent liquidity problems of financial institutions 

table of contents our cash needs for working capital are supported by a secured credit facility 
there is risk to this capital resource stemming from current market conditions in that the amount we have available to borrow under our loan agreement primarily is driven by the estimated liquidation value of our inventory 
external factors  such as increased liquidations and bankruptcies in the marketplace  could put downward pressure on this liquidation value and thus our associated borrowing availability 
however  we are taking steps to mitigate this risk 
first  we are focusing on maximizing cash flow and minimizing borrowing needs 
we expect to accomplish this by i increasing inventory turnover  which will require lower working capital to maintain fresh and adequate inventory at our stores  ii continuing to focus on expense control  including continual re engineering efforts to simplify and streamline administrative  inventory and other business processes  and to shrink or eliminate overhead costs as and when necessary or appropriate  and iii reducing capital spending and concentrating on investments with a demonstrable financial return 
second  we are improving the quality of our inventory by reducing the proportion of overstocked or discontinued goods 
third  we are maintaining frequent communications with our lenders to keep them apprised of our business plans and to monitor their ability to fund their loan commitment 
recent economic credit conditions have worsened and the pricing of debt under our existing credit facility may be favorable compared to the current market 
if renegotiated today  we believe our pricing could worsen by up to basis points and result in an incremental increase in interest charges 
such an incremental charge would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
operating activities during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million primarily due to a million decrease in merchandise inventories due to lower purchases 
the lower inventory purchases were because of lower revenues and our focus on better overall inventory management and correct product assortment in each store based on customer demographics 
this was partially offset by lower accounts payable of million  again due to lower inventory purchases  and by lower accrued expenses of million driven by timing of accrued payroll year over year 
capital growth in  we spent million on capital expenditures  mainly for new stores  store remodels  information technology and investment in supply chain efficiencies 
we opened four new stores and remodeled six stores in during  we expect a modest reduction in capital expenditures from the level in fiscal  and we expect capital expenditures will mainly be for store development activities  including new stores  store remodels and expansions  and information technology 
we intend to fund our expansion through cash generated from operations and bank borrowings 
financing arrangements net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily consisting of million in net repayments on our line of credit  partially offset by million in cash provided by financing activities related to associate share based compensation plans 
we have a credit facility for up to million that expires in december borrowing availability is based on a percentage of our inventory excluding capitalized indirect costs and certain accounts receivable 
at our option  subject to certain conditions and restrictions  our loan agreement provides up to million in additional financing during the term 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries and is secured by a security interest in all of our accounts receivable and inventory and that of our subsidiaries  certain other assets related thereto  and all proceeds thereof 
the credit facility includes a million sub facility available for the issuance of commercial and stand by letters of credit 
the credit facility also includes a sub limit of up to million for same day advances 

table of contents at our election  borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest based upon one of the following rates the prime rate announced by wells fargo bank  national association at its principal office in san francisco  california or the interest rate per annum at which deposits in us dollars are offered by reference lenders to prime banks in designated markets located outside the united states 
in each case  the applicable interest rate is increased by a margin imposed by the loan agreement 
the applicable margin for any date will depend upon the amount of available credit under the revolving facility 
the loan agreement also imposes a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility 
for and  the weighted average interest rate on all of the company s outstanding borrowings was and  respectively 
although our loan agreement contains customary covenants  including but not limited to  restrictions on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to incur debt  grant liens  make acquisitions and investments  pay dividends and sell or transfer assets  it does not contain debt or other similar financial covenants  such as maintaining certain specific leverage  debt service or interest coverage ratios 
instead  our loan is asset based which means our lenders maintain a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable which serve as collateral for the loan  and the amount we may borrow under our loan agreement at any given time is determined by the estimated liquidation value of these assets as determined by the lenders appraisers 
additional loan covenants include a requirement that we maintain minimum revolving credit availability equal to the lesser of million or of the borrowing base 
in addition  there are customary events of default under our loan agreement  including failure to comply with our covenants 
if we fail to comply with any of the covenants contained in the loan agreement  an event of default occurs which  if not waived by our lenders or cured within the applicable time periods  results in the lenders having the right to accelerate repayment of all outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreement before the stated maturity date 
a default under our loan agreement also could significantly and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing 
for example  the lenders obligation to extend credit is dependent upon our compliance with these covenants 
as of january   we were in compliance with our bank covenants 
at the end of fiscal year  borrowings under this credit facility were million  bearing interest at rates ranging from to  and million was available for future borrowings 
at the end of fiscal year  borrowings under this credit facility were million  bearing interest at rates ranging from to  and million was available to be borrowed 
at the end of fiscal year and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding commercial and stand by letters of credit 
the credit facility does not require a daily sweep lockbox arrangement except in specific circumstances  such as the occurrence of an event of default 
our aggregate borrowing base cannot exceed million and was million and million as of fiscal year and  respectively 
our borrowing base at each of our last two fiscal year ends consisted of the following in millions accounts receivable availability inventory availability less reserves total borrowing base our aggregate borrowing base was reduced by the following obligations in millions ending loan balance outstanding letters of credit total obligations 
table of contents accordingly  our availability as of fiscal year and  respectively  was in millions total borrowing base less obligations less minimum availability total availability contractual obligations aggregate information about our unconditional contractual obligations as of january  is presented in the following table in thousands 
total after years contractual cash obligations long term debt operating leases purchase commitments bank letters of credit other long term liabilities assumes that our bank long term debt is repaid at maturity and not refinanced 
includes estimated annual obligation for principal and interest payments  based upon the loan balance at january  and the average borrowing rate in operating lease amounts in this table represent minimum amounts due under existing agreements and exclude costs of insurance  taxes  repairs and maintenance 
all but a limited number of our purchase commitments  which are not material  are cancelable by us without penalty 
the timing of the remaining cash obligations including million for uncertain tax positions cannot be predicted 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for more information 
we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as delivery of functioning software products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
seasonality historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through august  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 

table of contents business trends our research indicates that the us boating industry continues to experience a down cycle  as evidenced by lower sales trends in each of our business segments compared to last year  lower new and used boat sales  and declining boat registrations in key states 
there are a number of steps we are taking to respond to this challenging industry climate and lower sales expectations to ensure orderly management of the business and preserve our financial strength to survive the current downturn and maximize our opportunity and when the marketplace recovers 
our focus has been to reduce expenses and maximize cash flow by controlling our operating expenses  continuing to improve the quality of our inventory by reducing overstocked or discontinued goods  maximizing cash flow and minimizing borrowing needs through inventory productivity management  including emphasizing specialized and localized product assortments in our stores  opening a small number of stores  closing stores and remodeling  expanding or significantly re merchandising stores during  reducing overhead by re engineering and streamlining business processes  closing our maryland distribution center  implementing service model changes in the port supply business to grow sales profitably  moving to a shared services model for external and internal customer service  closing our call center in largo  florida and moving to a virtual call center structure  enabling most of our call center associates to operate from their homes for maximum flexibility and optimization of cost and customer service levels  establishing a conservative budget for  which focuses on reduced capital spending  expense control and careful cash management  continuing to invest in our e commerce business in order to ensure customers are provided with better than expected customer service  and further exploring franchising and other growth vehicles to drive domestic and international sales and market presence 
we believe worsening economic conditions and turmoil in the financial markets have adversely impacted discretionary consumer spending in an already challenging climate for the boating industry  and we believe that this economic weakness will continue to have a depressing effect on our sales revenue  with corresponding risks to our earnings and cash flow in see the executive summary and segment revenues discussions included above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 

table of contents management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory valuation adjustments we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of the cost or market value on an average cost basis 
inventory cost is written down to market value when cost exceeds market value  which we estimate using current levels of aged and discontinued product and historical analysis of items sold below cost 
lower of cost or market adjustments included in ending inventory at january  and december  were million and million  respectively 
our lower of cost or market adjustments contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted consumer demand  the promotional environment  technological obsolescence and consumer preferences 
we have not made any material changes in our inventory valuation methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market adjustments 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
if we had to take additional markdowns of on all items included in merchandise inventory at january   net income would be affected by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
inventory capitalized indirect costs inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
capitalized indirect costs include freight charges for moving merchandise to warehouses or store locations and operating costs of our merchandising  replenishment and distribution activities 
we recognize indirect costs included in inventory value as an increase in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
indirect costs included in inventory value at january  and december  was million and million  respectively 
our capitalized indirect costs contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding factors of our cost accounting system  the soundness of the underlying principles and their consistent application 
in interim periods  the calculation of capitalized indirect costs requires management to estimate capitalized indirect costs  merchandise purchases and inventory levels for the full fiscal year 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our capitalized indirect costs 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our expenses included in capitalized indirect costs at january  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions costs associated with exit activities we occasionally vacate stores prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations that are under long term leases  we record an expense for the difference between our future lease payments and related costs eg  real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected future sublease rental income 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our analysis of the specific real estate market  including input from real estate firms  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
costs associated with exit activities included in accrued expenses at january  and december  was million and million  respectively 
our location closing liability contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future settlement payments  and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 
when making these assumptions  management considers a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our location closing liability at january   would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions impairment of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis 
we may also accelerate depreciation over the asset s revised useful life if it is identified for replacement or abandonment at a specific future date 
in fiscal years and  we incurred million and million charges  respectively  for impairment of long lived assets 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions deferred tax assets valuation allowance we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
as we determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we have a full valuation allowance against all net deferred tax assets of million 
if our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
our valuation allowance contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the future realization of net deferred tax assets 
we apply consistent methodologies to assess the need for a valuation allowance each quarter 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are reasonable  realization of net deferred tax assets ultimately depends on future taxable income 
actual results could differ 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to diminish our exposure to interest rate or currency rate risk  and we are not a party to any interest rate or currency rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
a basis point change in the interest rate of our weighted average interest rate affecting our floating financial instruments would have an effect of reducing our pre tax income and cash flows by approximately million over the next year 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item a increase in the exchange rate of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar would have an effect of reducing our pre tax income and cash flows by approximately million over the next year
