item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we have three reportable segments 
our consumer products and services segment includes our consumer protection and other consumer products and services 
this consists of identity theft management tools  membership product offerings and other subscription based services such as life and accidental death insurance 
our background screening segment includes the personnel and vendor background screening services provided by si 
our other segment includes the services for our relationship with a third party that administers referrals for identity theft to major banking institutions and breach response services reallocated from the consumer products and services segment 
this segment also includes the software management solutions for the bail bond industry provided by captira and corporate brand protection provided by net enforcers 
consumer products and services we offer consumers a variety of consumer protection services and other consumer products and services primarily on a subscription basis 
our services help consumers protect themselves against identity theft or fraud and understand and monitor their credit profiles and other personal information 
through our subsidiary  intersections insurance services  we offer a portfolio of services to include consumer discounts on healthcare  home  and auto related expenses  access to professional financial and legal information  and life  accidental death and disability insurance products 
our consumer services are offered through relationships with clients  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada  and clients in other industries 
we also offer our services directly to consumers 
our products and services are marketed to customers of our clients  and often are branded and tailored to meet our clients specifications 
our clients are principally credit card  direct deposit or mortgage issuing financial institutions  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada 
with certain of our 
table of contents financial institution clients  we have broadened our marketing efforts to access demand deposit accounts 
our financial institution clients currently account for the majority of our existing subscriber base 
we also are continuing to augment our client base through relationships with insurance companies  mortgage companies  brokerage companies  associations  travel companies  retail companies  web and technology companies and other service providers with significant market presence and brand loyalty 
with our clients  our services are marketed to potential subscribers through a variety of marketing channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing  inbound customer service and account activation calls  email  mass media and the internet 
our marketing arrangements with our clients sometimes call for us to fund and manage marketing activity 
the mix between our company funded and client funded marketing programs varies from year to year based upon our and our clients strategies 
we anticipate this trend of our company funded marketing programs continuing  and possibly increasing  into  particularly as our financial institution clients continue to request that we bear more of the new subscriber marketing costs as well as prepay commissions to them on new subscribers 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future until the financial markets and the general economy start to recover 
in  we expanded our efforts to market our consumer products and services directly to consumers 
we conduct our consumer direct marketing primarily through the internet 
we also may market through other channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing  email and mass media 
we expect to continue our own investment in marketing in with existing and new clients and expand our direct to consumer business 
our client arrangements are distinguished from one another by the allocation between us and the client of the economic risk and reward of the marketing campaigns 
the general characteristics of each arrangement are described below  although the arrangements with particular clients may contain unique characteristics direct marketing arrangements under direct marketing arrangements  we bear most of the new subscriber marketing costs and pay our client a commission for revenue derived from subscribers 
these commissions could be payable upfront in a lump sum on a per subscriber basis for the subscriber s enrollment  periodically over the life of a subscriber  or through a combination of both 
these arrangements generally result in negative cash flow over the first several months after a program is launched due to the upfront nature of the marketing investments 
in some arrangements we pay the client a service fee for access to the client s customers or billing of the subscribers by the client  and we may reimburse the client for certain of its out of pocket marketing costs incurred in obtaining the subscriber 
indirect marketing arrangements under indirect marketing arrangements  our client bears the marketing expense and pays us a service fee or percentage of the revenue 
because the subscriber acquisition cost is borne by our client under these arrangements  our revenue per subscriber is typically lower than that under direct marketing arrangements 
indirect marketing arrangements generally provide positive cash flow earlier than direct arrangements and the ability to obtain subscribers and utilize marketing channels that the clients otherwise may not make available 
shared marketing arrangements under shared marketing arrangements  marketing expenses are shared by us and the client in various proportions  and we may pay a commission to or receive a service fee from the client 
revenue generally is split relative to the investment made by our client and us 
the classification of a client relationship as direct  indirect or shared is based on whether we or the client pay the marketing expenses 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition  however  are not based on the classification of a client arrangement as direct  indirect or shared 
we look to the specific client arrangement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy  as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our typical contracts for direct marketing arrangements  and some indirect and shared marketing arrangements  provide that  after termination of the contract  we may continue to provide our services to existing subscribers  for periods ranging from two years to no specific termination period  under the economic arrangements that existed at the time of termination 
under certain of our agreements  however  including most indirect marketing arrangements and some shared marketing arrangements  the clients may require us to cease providing services 
table of contents under existing subscriptions 
clients under some contracts may also require us to cease providing services to their customers under existing subscriptions if the contract is terminated for material breach by us 
during the year ended december   we acquired membership agreements from citibank  which is recorded as a customer related intangible asset in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  for approximately million 
the intangible asset is amortized  on an accelerated basis  over the expected useful life of the subscribers  which we have determined to be ten years 
the acquisition of these contracts increases our revenue and amortization expense over the useful life of the asset 
as shown in the following table  the number of subscribers from our direct and shared marketing arrangements have increased over the past three fiscal years as of december  in thousands indirect marketing arrangements direct and shared marketing arrangements total subscribers through our increased direct marketing efforts over the last few years  subscribers in our consumer products and services segment from direct marketing arrangements has increased from in and in to of total subscribers as of december  the number of cancellations within the first days as a percentage of new subscribers was in  in and in the number of cancellations within the first days of subscription  as a percentage of new subscribers was slightly higher during the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
we analyze subscriber cancellations during the first days because we believe this time period affords the subscriber the opportunity to evaluate the service 
the number of cancellations after the first days  which are measured as a percentage of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the year plus new subscribers during the year less cancellations within the first days  was in  in and in this increase in is primarily due to a loss of approximately thousand subscribers from the termination of the wholesale relationship with discover 
the total number of cancellations during the year as a percentage of the beginning of the year subscribers plus new subscriber additions  was in  in  and in conversely  our retention rates  calculated by taking subscribers at the end of the year divided by subscribers at the beginning of the year plus additions for the year  decreased from in and in to in the retention rate decreased in primarily from the loss of approximately thousand subscribers from the termination of the wholesale relationship with discover 
revenue from subscribers obtained through our largest clients in the years ended december   and as a percentage of total revenue  and the principal contract arrangements with those clients  were as follows percentage of revenue for the years ended december  client relationship bank of america includes mbna shared direct marketing capital one direct and through equifax agreement indirect marketing discover indirect marketing citibank direct marketing citibank indirect marketing discover direct marketing american express shared marketing 
table of contents we have a master services agreement with equifax  which terminates in november  under which we provide various services to equifax in canada 
even if the master agreement is not terminated  however  either party may terminate the receipt of particular services from the other party on days prior notice 
with the exception of services to capital one customers acquired prior to january   and services related to equifax products in canada  we are not providing any services under that agreement 
prior to january   we provided our identity theft protection and credit management services under the master agreement with equifax to customers of capital one bank  or capital one  which marketed those services to consumers under an agreement between capital one and equifax 
on september   we entered into a marketing and services agreement with capital one under which  effective january   our services are marketed by capital one to its customers 
the services marketed to capital one customers under this agreement are substantially all of the services previously marketed through the master agreement between us and equifax  in addition to other services 
through our agreement with equifax  however  we continue to provide our services to the customers of capital one who enrolled for the services prior to january  on february   we received written notice from our client discover that  effective september   it was terminating the agreement for services administration between us and discover dated march   as amended the services agreement  including the omnibus amendment dated december  the omnibus amendment 
on the same date  we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the circuit court for fairfax county  virginia 
the complaint seeks a declaration that  if discover uses for its own purposes credit report authorizations given by customers to intersections or discover  it will be in breach of the services agreement and omnibus amendment to the services agreement 
in the complaint  intersections alleges that reliance on the credit report authorizations by discover or its new provider would be a breach of the services agreement and omnibus amendment thereto  and thus seeks a declaratory judgment to prevent discover from committing a breach of the parties contract 
a bench trial was held in the matter on february and   and we are awaiting a decision from the court 
we are re negotiating pricing or expect to re negotiate pricing with some of our top revenue producing clients in although some of these efforts may result in lower prices for some products  we expect that increasing volumes and changing of the sales mix to higher priced products will provide continued growth with these clients 
further  some of our top clients may look to us to increase our investments in subscriber acquisition  either through pre paid commissions or access to new marketing opportunities 
such opportunities enable us to grow our business and provide access to new avenues of subscriber growth possibly not available to us before 
background screening through our majority owned subsidiary  screening international  llc  we provide a variety of risk management tools for the purpose of personnel and vendor background screening services  including criminal background checks  driving records  employment verification and reference checks  drug testing and credit history checks to businesses worldwide 
our background screening services integrate data from various automated sources throughout the world  additional manual research findings from employees and subcontractors  and internal business logic provided by both screening international and by our clients into reports that assist in decision making 
our background screening services are generally sold to corporate clients under contractual arrangements with individual per unit prices for specific service specifications 
due to substantial difference in both service specifications and associated data acquisition costs  prices for our background screening services vary significantly among clients and geographies 
our clients include leading us  uk and global companies in such areas as manufacturing  staffing and recruiting agencies  financial services  retail and transportation 
our clients are primarily located in the us and the uk 
several of our clients have operations in other countries  and use our services in connection with those operations 
we have other clients in various countries  and expect the number of these clients to increase as we develop our global background screening business 
because we currently service the majority of our clients through our operations in the us and the uk  we consider those two locations to be the sources of our business for purposes of allocating revenue on a geographic basis 
we have several clients that contribute greater than of this segment s revenue 
the loss of one of these clients could have a material adverse impact on this segment s financial 
table of contents results 
revenue through our largest client in and was and of the segment s revenue 
none of these clients constitutes or more of our consolidated revenue 
during the fourth quarter ended  a significant client of si s uk subsidiary  control risks screening  terminated its relationship for background screening services 
in the year ended december   this client accounted for approximately of the subsidiary s revenue  but less than of our consolidated revenue 
we generally market our background screening services to businesses through an internal sales force 
our services are offered to businesses on a local or global basis 
prices for our services vary based upon complexity of the services offered  the cost of performing these services and competitive factors 
control risks group provides marketing assistance and services  and licenses certain trademarks to screening international under which our services are branded in certain geographic areas 
other our other segment includes our wholly owned subsidiary captira analytical  llc captira  which provides software and automated service solutions for the bail bonds industry 
these services include accounting  reporting  and decision making tools which allow bail bondsmen  general agents and sureties to run their offices more efficiently  to exercise greater operational and financial control over their businesses  and to make better underwriting decisions 
we believe captira s services are the only fully integrated suite of bail bonds management applications of comparable scope available in the marketplace today 
captira s services are sold to retail bail bondsman on a per seat license basis plus additional one time or transaction related charges for various optional services 
as captira s business model is relatively new  pricing and service configurations are subject to change at any time 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  net enforcers  inc net enforcers  we provide corporate identity theft protection services  including online brand monitoring  online auction monitoring and enforcement  intellectual property monitoring and other services 
net enforcers services include the use of sophisticated technology to search the internet for potential property right infringements  value added analysis and recommendation from our trained staff of analysts  and manual or automated enforcement activities as directed by our clients 
net enforcers services are typically priced as monthly subscriptions for a defined set of monitoring and analysis services  as well as per transaction charges for enforcement related services 
prices for our services vary based upon the specific configuration of services purchased by each client and range from several hundred dollars per month to thousands of dollars per month 
the pro forma impact of captira or net enforcers  prior to their acquisitions  on our historical operating results is not material 
we also offer victim assistance services as part of our agreement with the identity theft assistance corporation itac to help victims of identity theft that are referred to itac by their financial institutions 
we assist these customers in identifying instances of identity theft that appear on their credit report  notifying the affected institutions  and sharing the data with law enforcement 
these victim assistance services are provided free to the customers and we are paid fees by the itac members for the services we provide to their customers 
in addition  we offer data security breach response services to organizations responding to compromises of sensitive personal information 
we help these clients notify the affected individuals and we provide the affected individuals with identity theft recovery and credit monitoring services offered by our clients at no charge to the affected individuals 
we are paid fees by the clients for the services we provide their customers 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business 
table of contents operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
investments our short term investments consist of short term us treasury securities with original maturities greater than days but no greater than one year 
these investments are categorized as held to maturity  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and are carried at amortized cost because we have both the intent and the ability to hold these investments until they mature 
discounts are accreted into earnings over the life of the investment 
interest income is recognized when earned 
there are no restrictions on the withdrawal of these investments 
our long term investments consist of investments in equity shares of privately held companies and are evaluated in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb 
during the year ended december   we paid approximately million in cash for a preferred stock investment in guardid systems  inc guardid  a privately held company in california 
in addition  we received stock purchase warrants to purchase million shares of guardid s preferred stock at per share 
the warrants are contingently excercisable subject to guardid meeting certain revenue thresholds 
guardid provides smart card based hardware solutions to safeguard consumers against identity theft and online crime when they bank  shop and invest online 
as a result of the equity investment  we own less than of guardid 
the investment is accounted for at cost on the consolidated balance sheet 
see note  long term investments 
we evaluate impairment of investments in accordance with emerging issues task force  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
accordingly  we consider both triggering events and tangible evidence that investments are recoverable within a reasonable period of time  as well as our intent and ability to hold investments that may have become temporarily or otherwise impaired 
we did not have any impairment of our investments in the year ended december  foreign currency translation we account for foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiary at the exchange rates in effect at the end of the period and the results of operations at the average rate throughout the period 
the translation adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of shareholders equity  while transaction gains and losses are included in net income 
our financial results for the years ended december  and include a net impact of million related to foreign currency transaction losses and million related to a foreign currency transaction gain  respectively 
derivative financial instruments we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted 
sfas no 
requires us to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value  and contains accounting guidance for hedging instruments  which depend on the nature of the hedge relationship 
all financial instrument positions are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
in the year ended december   we entered into certain interest rate swap transactions that convert our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
our interest rate swaps are related to variable interest rate risk exposure associated with our long term debt and are intended to manage this risk 
the counterparty to our derivative agreements is a major financial institution for which we continually monitor its position and credit ratings 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by this financial institution 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in the shareholders equity section in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps  if any  is recorded in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents we have interest rate swaps on our outstanding term loan and a portion of our outstanding revolving line of credit  which have initial notional amounts of million and million  respectively see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the swaps modify our interest rate exposure by effectively converting the variable rate on our term loan at december  to a fixed rate of per annum through december and on our revolving line of credit at december  to a fixed rate of per annum through december the notional amount of the term loan interest rate swap amortizes on a monthly basis through december and the notional amount of the line of credit interest rate swap amortizes to million in and terminates in december we use the monthly libor interest rate and have the intent and ability to continue to use this rate on our hedged borrowings 
accordingly  we do not recognize any ineffectiveness on the swaps as allowed under the hypothetical derivative method of derivative implementation group issue no 
g  cash flow hedges measuring the ineffectiveness of a cash flow hedge under paragraph b when the shortcut method is not applied 
for the year ended december   there was no material ineffective portion of the hedge and therefore  no impact to the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value measurements we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  as amended  on january  sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb released a fasb staff position fsp fas effective date of fasb statement no 
which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  the partial adoption of sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently analyzing the impact  if any  of adopting sfas no 
for non financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
fasb staff position fsp no 
 determining the fair value of an asset when the market for that asset is not active  clarifies the application of sfas no 
in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  sfas no 
establishes a three tier value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require us to develop our own assumptions 
this hierarchy requires us to use observable market data  when available  and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value 
on a recurring basis  we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  including marketable securities and our interest rate swaps 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 on january  sfas no 
expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require certain assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas no 
 a company may elect to use fair value to measure eligible items at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
eligible items include  but are not limited to  accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees  issued debt and firm commitments 
currently  we have not expanded our eligible items subject to the fair value option under sfas no 
for the financial instruments that are not accounted for under sfas  which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term government debt instruments  trade accounts receivables  notes payable  leases 
table of contents payable  accounts payable and short term and long term debt  we consider the recorded value of the financial instruments to approximate the fair value based on the liquidity of these financial instruments 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on identity theft  credit management and background services  accidental death insurance and other membership products and other monthly subscription products 
our products and services are offered to consumers principally on a monthly subscription basis 
subscription fees are generally billed directly to the subscriber s credit card  mortgage bill or demand deposit accounts 
the prices to subscribers of various configurations of our products and services range generally from to per month 
as a means of allowing customers to become familiar with our services  we sometimes offer free trial or guaranteed refund periods 
no revenue is recognized during this refund or trial period 
identity theft  credit management and background services we recognize revenue from our services in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
consistent with the requirements of sab no 
s and  revenue is recognized when a persuasive evidence of arrangement exists as we maintain signed contracts with all of our large financial institution customers and paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchases  b delivery has occurred once the product is transmitted over the internet  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as sales are generally based on contract or list prices and payments from large financial institutions are collected within days with no significant write offs  and d collectability is reasonably assured as individual customers pay by credit card which has limited our risk of non collection 
revenue for monthly subscriptions is recognized in the month the subscription fee is earned 
for subscriptions with refund provisions whereby only the prorated subscription fee is refunded upon cancellation by the subscriber  deferred subscription fees are recorded when billed and amortized as subscription fee revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period  generally one year 
we generate revenue from one time credit reports and background screenings which are recognized when the report is provided to the customer electronically  which is generally at the time of completion 
revenue for annual subscription fees must be deferred if the subscriber has the right to cancel the service 
annual subscriptions include subscribers with full refund provisions at any time during the subscription period and pro rata refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscription with full refund provisions is recognized on the expiration of these refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscribers with pro rata provisions is recognized based on a pro rata share of revenue earned 
an allowance for discretionary subscription refunds is established based on our actual experience 
we also provide services for which certain financial institution clients are the primary obligors directly to their customers 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized when earned  which is at the time we provide the service  generally on a monthly basis 
the amount of revenue recorded by us is determined in accordance with financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which addresses whether a company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained by us amount billed less commissions or fees paid 
we generally record revenue on a gross basis in the amount that we bill the subscriber when our arrangements with financial institution clients provide for us to serve as the primary obligor in the transaction  we have latitude in establishing price and we bear the credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we generally record revenue in the amount that we bill our financial institution clients  and not the amount billed to their customers  when our financial institution client is the primary obligor  establishes price to the customer and bears the credit risk 
accidental death insurance and other membership products we recognize revenue from our services in accordance with sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
consistent with the requirements of sab no 
s and  revenue is recognized when a persuasive evidence of 
table of contents arrangement exists as we maintain paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchases  b delivery has occurred at the completion of a product trial period  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as the price of the product is agreed to by the customer as a condition of the sales transaction which established the sales arrangement  and d collectability is reasonably assured as evidenced by our collection of revenue through the monthly mortgage payments of our customers or through checking account debits to our customers accounts 
revenues from insurance contracts are recognized when earned 
marketing of our insurance products generally involves a trial period during which time the product is made available at no cost to the customer 
no revenues are recognized until applicable trial periods are completed 
the amount of revenue recorded by us is determined in accordance with fasb s eitf for insurance products  we generally record revenue on a net basis as we perform as an agent or broker for the insurance products without assuming the risks of ownership of the insurance products 
for membership products  we generally record revenue on a gross basis as we serve as the primary obligor in the transactions  have latitude in establishing price and bear credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we participate in agency relationships with insurance carriers that underwrite insurance products offered by us 
accordingly  insurance premiums collected from customers and remitted to insurance carriers are excluded from our revenues and operating expenses 
insurance premiums collected but not remitted to insurance carriers as of december  and  totaled million and million  respectively  and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other monthly subscription products we generate revenue from other types of subscription based products provided from our other segment 
we recognize revenue on services provided from identity theft referrals from major banking institutions and breach response services previously allocated to the consumer products and services segment 
we also recognize revenue from providing management service solutions  offered by captira  on a monthly subscription basis and online brand protection and brand monitoring  offered by net enforcers  on a monthly basis 
deferred subscription solicitation and advertising our deferred subscription solicitation costs consist of subscription acquisition costs  including telemarketing  web based marketing expenses and direct mail such as printing and postage 
we expense advertising costs the first time advertising takes place 
telemarketing  web based marketing and direct mail expenses are direct response advertising costs  which are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  reporting on advertising costs 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized as deferred subscription solicitation costs are evaluated at each balance sheet date  in accordance with sop  by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost pool basis to the probable remaining future benefit expected to result directly from such advertising costs 
probable remaining future benefit is estimated based upon historical subscriber patterns  and represents net revenues less costs to earn those revenues 
in estimating probable future benefit on a per subscriber basis we deduct our contractual cost to service that subscriber from the known sales price 
we then apply the future benefit on a per subscriber basis to the number of subscribers expected to be retained in the future to arrive at the total probable future benefit 
in estimating the number of subscribers we will retain ie  factoring in expected cancellations  we utilize historical subscriber patterns maintained by us that show attrition rates by client  product and marketing channel 
the total probable future benefit is then compared to the costs of a given marketing campaign ie  cost pools  and if the probable future benefit exceeds the cost pool  the amount is considered to be recoverable 
if direct response advertising costs were to exceed the estimated probable remaining future benefit  an adjustment would be made to the deferred subscription costs to the extent of any shortfall 
we amortize deferred subscription solicitation costs on a cost pool basis over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received  but no more than months 

table of contents commission costs in accordance with sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
 commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full refund provisions and monthly subscriptions are expensed in the month incurred  unless we are entitled to a refund of the commissions 
if annual subscriptions are cancelled prior to their initial terms  we are generally entitled to a full refund of the previously paid commission for those annual subscriptions with a full refund provision and a pro rata refund  equal to the unused portion of their subscription  for those annual subscriptions with a pro rata refund provision 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full commission refund provisions are deferred until the earlier of expiration of the refund privileges or cancellation 
once the refund privileges have expired  the commission costs are recognized in the same pattern that the related revenue is recognized 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with pro rata refund provisions are deferred and charged to operations as the corresponding revenue is recognized 
if a subscription is cancelled  upon receipt of the refunded commission from our client  we record a reduction to the deferred commission 
we have prepaid commission agreements with some of our clients 
under these agreements  we pay a commission on new subscribers in lieu of ongoing commission payments 
we amortize these prepaid commissions  on an accelerated basis  over a period of time not to exceed three years  which is the average expected life of customers 
the short term portion of the prepaid commissions is shown in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of the prepaid commissions is shown in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
amortization is included in commissions expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
deferred subscription solicitation costs included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  and december   were million and million  which includes million and million reported in other assets  respectively 
the short term portion of the prepaid commissions are approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  and is included in deferred subscription solicitation costs in our consolidated balance sheet 
amortization of deferred subscription solicitation and commission costs  which are included in either marketing or commissions expense in our consolidated statements of operations  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
subscription solicitation costs expensed as incurred related to marketing costs  which are included in marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations  as they did not meet the criteria for deferral in accordance with sop  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
software development costs we develop software for internal use and capitalize software development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and eitf  accounting for web site development cost 
costs incurred prior to and after the application development stage are charged to expense 
when the software is ready for its intended use  capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  which is generally three to five years 
in accordance with sop  the company regularly reviews its capitalized software projects for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we did not have any impairments in the years ended december   or goodwill  identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets we record  as goodwill  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in purchase transactions 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and follow the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we test goodwill annually as of october or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill has been assigned to our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
we have three reporting units consumer products and services  background screening and other  which is consistent with our operating segments 
goodwill resides in all three of our reporting units 

table of contents a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  b a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  c a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  d unanticipated competition  e the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and f slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  using a combined income discounted cash flow valuation model and market based approach  which measures the value of an entity through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable companies 
the income approach measures the value of the reporting units by the present values of its economic benefits 
these benefits can include revenue and cost savings 
value indications are developed by discounting expected cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for use of funds  trends within the industry  and risks associated with particular investments of similar type and quality as of the valuation date 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units is dependent on several significant assumptions  including our earnings projections  and our cost of capital discount rate 
the projections use management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including business plans  growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill 
we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach 
consideration is given to the line of business and operating performance of the entities being valued relative to those of actual transactions  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its goodwill carrying value to measure the amount of impairment charge  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
in other words  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of that reporting unit was the purchase price paid 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determined  in the first step of our goodwill impairment analysis performed as of october   that goodwill in the background screening and other reporting units was impaired 
additionally  due to the deterioration in the general economic environment and our market capitalization subsequent to the performance of our initial impairment test  we concluded a triggering event had occurred indicating potential additional impairment as of december  as of december   we considered these current and expected future market conditions and estimated that the remaining goodwill in our other reporting unit was impaired 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis  we are required to hypothetically apply purchase accounting to the reporting units using the fair values from the first step 
due to the timing and complexity of step two  we have yet to complete this step 
however  based upon our calculations  we recorded a preliminary estimate of million and million for the impairment charge in our statements of operations for the year ended december  for our background screening and other segment  respectively 
we are continuing to finalize the evaluation of the impairment of our goodwill  and the amount of the actual impairment charge may vary from this initial estimate 
we expect to complete the full evaluation of the impairment analysis during the quarter ending march  the impairment will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 

table of contents we will continue to monitor our market capitalization  along with other operational performance measures and general economic conditions 
a downward trend in one or more of these factors could cause us to reduce the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and recognize a corresponding impairment of our goodwill in connection with a future goodwill impairment test 
we review long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  property and equipment and other long term assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and determining the future cash flows for assets involved 
in conducting its analysis  the company compares the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long lived assets to the related net book values 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the net book value  the long lived assets are considered not to be impaired 
if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge is measured and recognized 
an impairment charge is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long lived assets 
fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows associated with these assets 
intangible assets subject to amortization include trademarks and customer  marketing and technology related assets and well as non compete agreements 
such intangible assets  excluding customer related  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which are generally three to ten years 
customer related intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line or accelerated basis  dependent upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up 
as a result of the termination of a key employee under a non compete agreement  the discontinued use of certain technology and the decrease in demand for our products at our subsidiary  net enforcers  we reviewed our finite lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
using the income and relief from royalty methods 
based on this analysis  the carrying values of these assets exceeded the estimated fair values 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the customer  marketing and technology related finite lived intangible assets in the other segment for the year ended december  in addition  under a contract with a third party data provider  we paid minimum payments to the provider for the usage of data and certain exclusivity rights 
the data purchased under this agreement was non credit data intended for use primarily in our fraud protection products 
these payments were being capitalized in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet and were being amortized based upon the actual usage of the data 
due to declining market conditions  including the impact on our financial institution clients and their pace in adoption of new product capabilities such as non credit data  in december  we terminated the original contract with this data provider and entered into a new contract 
the new contract allows us enhanced data and services and improved licensing terms 
the minimum payments by us under the new agreement will be lower than under the old agreement by million in and million in  but the total payments will remain the same 
we believe that the revised payment terms align more closely with the expected pace of adoption of new product capabilities 
minimum payments due under the new arrangement will be expensed as incurred under operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
we performed a fas analysis to determine if the remaining asset recorded under the original contract was impaired 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of approximately million related to the unamortized payments 
this impairment charge will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
net loss for the year ended december   included an income tax benefit of approximately million 
the income tax benefit includes a non cash increase of the valuation allowance on cumulative federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets of approximately thousand  thousand and million  respectively 
these deferred tax assets are primarily related to federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards that we believe 
table of contents cannot be utilized in the foreseeable future 
sfas no 
requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
according to sfas no 
 a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
due to over two years of cumulative losses and forecasted losses in the near term for our background screening segment  a valuation allowance of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law 
as a matter of course  we may be audited by various taxing authorities and these audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
in june  the fasb issued financial interpretation fin no

 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement

trends related to the current economic environment we anticipate the weakening economy to have the following three principal effects on our business we expect new card issuances at our financial institution clients to slow  which in turn translates into a softening of revenue for our consumer products and services segment 
we also expect charge or credit card delinquencies and card cancellations to increase  which might result in the increased cancellation of certain of our services 
our relationships with some financial institution clients may change to more direct marketing arrangements as they look more for outside sources to fund partner programs and invest in marketing  which can present both opportunities and challenges to us 
this may require additional cash  which may not be available to us 
the consolidation of the major financial institutions and turbulence with the financial services market will also have an impact 
we also expect a global slowdown in hiring to reduce the volume of purchases of background screening reports  which will reduce revenue in our background screening segment 
reductions in external spending by financial institutions and corporations may reduce case volumes and increase cancellation rates in our other segment

in  we entered into certain interest rate swap transactions that convert our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt

the counterparty to our derivative agreements is a major financial institution for which we continually monitor its position and credit ratings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments and consist primarily of short term us treasury securities with original maturity dates of less than or equal to days 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
market risks related to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our interest rate exposure is related to long term debt obligations 
a significant portion of our interest expense is based upon changes in the benchmark interest rate libor 
we have entered into a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate the variable rate risk on our long term debt obligations 
the fixed rate is and on notional amounts of million and million  respectively  as of december  foreign currency we have a foreign majority owned subsidiary  screening international  and therefore  are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
screening international s wholly owned subsidiary  control risks screening limited  is located in the united kingdom  conducts international business and prepares financial statements per uk statutory requirements in british pounds 
control risks screening s financial statements are translated to us dollars for us gaap reporting 
as a result  our financial results are affected by fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates 
during and the first half of  the us dollar has generally been weaker relative to the british pound 
this weakness had a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations during those periods 
however  during the past several months  the us dollar has strengthened relative to the british pound  which has adversely impacted our results of operations as british pounds are translating into less us dollars 
the impact of the transaction gains and losses from the uk statutory records on the income statement was a loss of thousand for the year ended december  we do not believe that the volatile impact of exchange risk from recent prior periods is indicative of the future  however  there can be no assurances that this volatility will not continue 
we have international sales in canada and  therefore  are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
we collect fees from subscriptions in canadian currency and pay a portion of the related expenses in canadian currency  which mitigates our exposure to currency exchange rate risk 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions 
during the year ended december   the us dollar has generally been stronger relative to the canadian dollar  which has adversely impacted our results of operations as canadian dollars are translating into less us dollars 
we have commenced startup operations in singapore and therefore  are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
the impact of the transaction gains and losses from the singapore statutory records on the income statement was a loss of thousand for the year ended december  we have determined that the impact of the conversion has an insignificant effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows and we believe that a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar relative to the singapore currency will continue to have an insignificant effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and transaction risk  however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
we will assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
the foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in our results of operations  and were not material for all periods presented 
fair value we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as our investments consist primarily of short term us treasury securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
