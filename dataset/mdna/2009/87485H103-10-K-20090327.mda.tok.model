critical accounting policies the accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
the most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
the company has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of the current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the company evaluates the allowance for loan loss on a quarterly basis and believes that the allowance for loan loss is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectability of the loans  including current and projected economic conditions  past credit experience  delinquency status  the value of the underlying collateral  if any  and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans and commitments 
the company determines the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  primarily on an analysis of the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits on an individual basis 
the company segments the loan portfolios into as many components as practical 
each component would normally have similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
the company analyzes the following components of the portfolio and provides for them in the allowance for loan losses 
all significant credits on an individual basis that are classified doubtful 
all other significant credits reviewed individually 
if no allocation can be determined for such credits on an individual basis  they shall be provided for as part of an appropriate pool 
all other loans that are not included by the credit grading system in the population of loans reviewed individually  but are delinquent or are classified or designated special mention eg pools of smaller delinquent  special mention and classified commercial and industrial  and real estate loans 
homogenous loans that have not been reviewed individually  or are not delinquent  classified  or designated as special mention eg pools of real estate mortgages 
all other loans that have not been considered or provided for elsewhere eg pools of commercial and industrial loans that have not been reviewed  classified  or designated special mention and other off balance sheet commitments to lend 
no assurance can be given that the company will not sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio will not require an increase in the allowance 
prevailing factors in association with the methodology may include improvement or deterioration of individual improvement or deterioration of individual commitments or pools of similar loans  or loan concentrations 
available for sale securities statement of financial accounting standards sfas requires that available for sale securities be carried at fair value 
this is a critical accounting estimate in that the fair value of a security is based on quoted market prices or if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
adjustments to the available for sale securities fair value impact the consolidated financial statements by increasing or decreasing assets and stockholders equity 
servicing asset the company services sba and non sba loans for investors and records a related mortgage servicing asset 
the servicing calculations contain certain assumptions such as the expected life of the loan and the discount rate used to compute the present value of future cash flows 
exposure results from the loan life assumption if loans prepay faster than expected 
exposures results from the discount rate assumption if prime rate adjusts severely and permanently  which can cause adjustments to the income statement 
supplemental employee retirement plan the company has entered into supplemental employee retirement agreements with certain executive officers 
the liability under these agreements is measured in accordance with sfas no 
the liability is based on estimates involving life expectancy  length of time before retirement  appropriate discount rate  forfeiture rates and expected benefit levels 
should these estimates prove materially different from actual results  the company could incur additional or reduced future expense 
deferred tax assets deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
the company uses an estimate of future earnings to support the position that the benefit of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and the net income will be reduced 
accounting change from time to time  the financial accounting standards board issues pronouncements which govern the accounting treatment for the company s financial statements 
for a description of the recent pronouncements applicable to the company  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
summary results of operations in  the federal reserve lowered its federal funds rate the rate at which banks may borrow from each other by two hundred basis points resulting in lower offered deposit rates by the bank  which positively affected the interest margin 
however  the variable rate loans adjusted downward with the decline in the prime rate  subject to any contracted floor rates 
these changes resulted in a significant improvement to the net interest margin 
the ongoing and deepening recession has caused declining real estate values and has reduced the liquidity and net worth of businesses and consumers in the company s market area

net interest income is impacted by changes in general market interest rates and by changes in the amounts and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
comparisons of net interest income are frequently made using net interest margin and net interest rate spread 
net interest margin is expressed as net interest income divided by average earning assets 
net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest earning assets and the average rate incurred on total interest bearing liabilities 
both of these measures are reported on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest margin is the higher of the two because it reflects interest income earned on assets funded with non interest bearing sources of funds  which includes demand deposits and stockholders equity 
the average balance of nonperforming loans is included in the average balance of loans 
because nonperforming loans do not accrue income  an increase in nonperforming loans will result in a decrease in asset yield 
as of december  compared to  rates paid on interest bearing liabilities declined faster than yields on earning assets  resulting in a twenty nine basis point increase in net interest margin 
as of december  compared to  rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased faster than yields on earning assets  resulting in a twenty one basis point decrease in net interest margin

the following table sets forth components of total net loans outstanding in each category at the dates indicated at december  dollars in thousands one to four family residential multifamily residential commercial real estate land construction real estate consumer loans commercial  non real estate total gross loans net deferred loan costs total loans receivable  net of deferred loan costs allowance for loan losses loans receivable  net outstanding loan commitments at december  and december  primarily consisted of undisbursed construction loans  lines of credit  and commitments to originate commercial real estate and multifamily loans 
based upon past experience  the outstanding loan commitments may grow throughout the year if loan demand increases  subject to economic conditions 
as of december   the hospitality industry was identified as a concentration of credit as it represents of the loan portfolio 
additionally  as of december  and december   approximately and  respectively  of the bank s loans were secured by real estate 
commercial real estate is comprised of owner user  investor  owner user sba and owner user sba 
although management believes this concentration to have no more than the normal risk of collectability  a substantial decline in the economy in general  or a decline in real estate values in the company s primary market areas in particular  could have an adverse impact on the collectability of these loans and requires an additional increase in the provision for loan losses 
the bank monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions as well as other factors on the collectability of real estate loans 
real estate construction loans are primarily interim loans to finance the construction of commercial  multifamily and single family residential property 
these loans are typically short term 
other real estate loans consist primarily of loans made based on the property and or the borrower s individual and business cash flows 
maturities on real estate loans other than construction loans are generally restricted to fifteen years on an amortization of thirty years with a balloon payment due in fifteen years 
any loans extended for greater than five years generally have re pricing provisions that adjust the interest rate to market rates at times prior to maturity 
commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit are made for the purpose of providing working capital  covering fluctuations in cash flows  financing the purchase of equipment  or for other business purposes 
such loans and lines of credit include loans with maturities ranging from one to five years 
consumer loans and lines of credit are made for the purpose of financing various types of consumer goods and other personal purposes 
consumer loans and lines of credits generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest or interest only payments with periodic principal payments 
in extending credit and commitments to borrowers  the company generally requires collateral and or guarantees as security 
the repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flow or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers 
the company s requirement for collateral and or guarantees is determined on a case by case basis in connection with management s evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing properties  residences and other real property 
the company secures its collateral by perfecting its security interest in business assets  obtaining deeds of trust  or outright possession among other means 
as of december  and  the loan portfolio was primarily comprised of floating and adjustable interest rate loans 
the following table sets forth the repricing percentages of the adjustable rate loans as of december  and december  december  reprice within one year reprice within one to two years reprice within two to three years reprice within three to four years reprice within four to five years reprice after five years total the following table sets forth the maturity distribution of loans as of december  and december  at those dates  the bank had no loans with maturity greater than thirty years 
in addition  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined fixed interest rates and those with adjustable floating interest rates 
adjustable interest rates generally fluctuate with changes in the various pricing indices  primarily the six month constant maturity treasury index  six month libor  and prime rate 
at december  maturing within one year maturing one to five years maturing after five years total dollars in thousands one to four family residential multifamily residential commercial real estate land construction real estate consumer loans commercial  non real estate total loans with predetermined interest rates loans with floating or adjustable interest rates allowance for loan losses the bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
additions to the allowance are made by charges to operating expenses in the form of a provision for loan losses 
all loans that are judged to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance while any recoveries are credited to the allowance 
management has instituted loan policies which includes using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies to adequately evaluate and assess the analysis of risk factors associated with its loan portfolio and to enable management to assess such risk factors prior to granting new loans  and to assess the sufficiency of the allowance 
actual loan losses could differ materially from management s estimate if actual loss factors and conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized 
management conducts a critical evaluation of the loan portfolio quarterly 
this evaluation is an assessment of the following factors including the results of the internal loan review  any external loan review and any regulatory examination  loan loss experience  estimated potential loss exposure on each credit  concentrations of credit  value of collateral  any known impairment in the borrower s ability to repay and present economic conditions 
loans receiving lesser grades fall under the classified category  which includes all nonperforming and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection 
foreclosed or repossessed loan collateral  other real estate owned oreo  is recorded at the lower of cost or appraised value less estimated costs 
there are  however  limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the volume of loans makes it impractical to re grade every loan every quarter 
therefore  it is possible that some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
each month the bank also reviews the allowance and makes additional transfers to the allowance as needed 
at december  and december   the allowance for loan losses was and  respectively  of loans outstanding 
while no assurance can be given  management believes that the increase in the allowance is adequate to reflect the increase in the loan portfolio balance  non accrual loans and the overall economic downturn  which may adversely affect small businesses and borrowers in the bank s market areas 
the bank is working diligently with all borrowers to proactively identify and address difficulties as they arise 
as of december  and  charge offs of loans totaled  and  respectively  and recoveries on previously charged off loans totaled  and  respectively 
there were eighteen nonperforming loans as of december   one nonperforming loan as of december  and one foreclosed property that was transferred to other real estate owned as of december  after the additional charges to the allowance for loan losses for the fourth quarter  the bank continues to be well capitalized under regulatory capital requirements 
as of december  and  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was and  respectively 
although the company deems these levels adequate as of such periods  no assurance can be given that further economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect the borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur 
these losses would be reflected in increased losses in the loan portfolio  which losses could possibly exceed the amount then reserved for loan losses 
the following table summarizes the loan loss experience  transactions in the allowance for loan losses and certain pertinent ratios for the periods indicated for the year ended december  dollars in thousands gross loans outstanding  period end average amount of loans outstanding period end non performing loans outstanding loans loss reserve balance  beginning of period net charge offs recoveries additions reductions charged to operations allowance for loan and lease loss  end of period ratio of net charge offs recoveries during the period to average loans outstanding during the period ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans at period end nonperforming assets the bank manages credit losses by consistently enforcing conservative underwriting and administration procedures and aggressively pursuing collection efforts with troubled debtors 
the bank closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk and to increase diversification of earning assets 
internal and external loan reviews are performed frequently using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
management has evaluated loans that it considers to carry additional risk above the normal risk of collectability  and by taking actions where possible to reduce credit risk exposure by methods that include  but are not limited to  seeking liquidation of the loan by the borrower  seeking additional tangible collateral or other repayment support  converting the property through judicial or non judicial foreclosure proceedings  and other collection techniques 
all significant nonaccrual loans have been evaluated for impairment and have been assigned specific reserves as deemed necessary 
going forward  the bank will continue to review all impaired loans on a quarterly basis in accordance with statement of financial standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the bank s policy is to place loans on non accrual status when  for any reason  principal or interest is past due for ninety days or more unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection or if the bank determines that there is little to no chance of being paid current by the borrower 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on nonaccrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonaccrual loans 
any interest accrued  but unpaid  is reversed against current income 
interest received on non accrual loans is credited to income only upon receipt and in certain circumstances may be applied to principal until the loan has been repaid in full  at which time the interest received is credited to income 
nonaccrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectability of both interest and principal 
when appropriate or necessary to protect the company s interests  real estate taken as collateral on a loan may be taken by the company through foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
real property acquired in this manner is known as other real estate owned  or oreo 
oreo is carried on the books as an asset at fair value less estimated costs to sell 
oreo represents an additional category of nonperforming assets 
the company did not have any oreo as of december  and one oreo for  as of december  the following table provides information with respect to the components of the nonperforming assets at the dates indicated

deposits the principal source of funds for the bank are core deposits non interest and interest bearing transaction accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  and certificates of deposits from the bank s market areas 
at december   total deposits were  representing an increase of  or over the december  balance 
the company s deposit growth plan for and to continue into was to concentrate its efforts on increasing noninterest bearing demand accounts 
as of december   these accounts increased  or as compared to the same period prior year 
the bank also experienced increases in interest bearing demand accounts  money market and savings and time deposits accounts greater and less than  the company obtained wholesale deposits through deposit brokers of million of deposits and million of deposits and through non brokered wholesale sources of million of deposits and million of deposits as of december  and  respectively 
these deposits  some of which were certificates of deposit of  or more  were obtained for generally longer terms than can be acquired through retail sources as a means to control interest rate risk or were acquired to fund all short term differences between loan and deposit growth rates 
however  based on the amount of wholesale funds maturing in each month  the company may not be able to replace all wholesale deposits with retail deposits upon maturity 
to the extent that the company needs to renew maturing wholesale deposits at then current interest rates  the company incurs the risk of paying higher interest rates for these potentially volatile sources of funds 
in  the bank established a relationship with reserve funds  an institutional money manager that offers a money market savings based sweep product to community banks 
under this program  end investors use the reserve funds as a conduit to invest money market savings deposits in a consortium of community banks 
the end investors receive a rate of interest that is generally higher than alternative money market funds  the community banks receive large money market savings balances  and the reserve funds receives a fee by acting as the conduit 
the bank began accepting deposits from this program in november in  the bank terminated its relationship with the reserve funds and established a relationship with total bank solutions in as of december  and  the deposits were million and million  respectively

the following table summarizes the significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  contractual obligations at december  year years years years total operating leases borrowings debt borrowed funds in response to the current market s strong competition for deposit accounts  the company has supplemented its funding base by increasing fhlb borrowings 
the borrowings obtained in have generally been at lower rates and longer terms than alternative retail certificate of deposits 
the average term of fhlb borrowings has also been extended as a means to control interest rate risk 
the company has secured advances from the federal home loan bank at december  and december  amounting to million and million  respectively  a increase 
the increase in fhlb borrowings was primarily due to funding the rate of growth of the loan portfolio while matching the duration of the loan portfolio to minimize interest rate risk 
as of december   unused borrowing capacity at the fhlb was million under a formula based on eligible collateral 
assets pledged as collateral to the fhlb consisted of million of the loan portfolio and million of the investment securities portfolio as of december  as of december   the unused borrowing capacity at the fhlb was million and assets pledged as collateral to the fhlb consisted of million of the loan portfolio and million of the investment securities portfolio as of december  the advances have been outstanding at varying levels as of december  total interest expense on fhlb borrowings as of december  and was  and  respectively 
over time the company expects that funds provided by retail deposits obtained through the increasing branch network and business banking group will be utilized to decrease fhlb borrowings during periods when the growth in deposits exceeds the growth in loans

ace provides funds for projects and activities that result in the creation or retention of jobs or provides services or other benefits for low and moderate income people and communities 
ace funds may be used to support community lending and economic development  including small business  community facilities  and public works projects 
an advantage to using this program is that the interest rates and fees are generally lower than rates and fees on regular fhlb advances 
the maximum amount of advances that a bank may borrow under the ace program depends on a bank s total assets as of the previous year end

the company used the net proceeds from this transaction to fund the growth of the bank and to increase the bank s capital position 
total interest expense attributable to the long term debt as of december  was  capital resources under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  capital adequacy is measured as a percentage of risk adjusted assets in which risk percentages are applied to assets on the balance sheet as well as off balance sheet  such as unused loan commitments 
the guidelines require that a portion of total capital be core  or tier capital consisting of common stockholders equity and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
tier capital consists of other elements  primarily non perpetual preferred stock  subordinated debt and mandatory convertible debt  plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
the guidelines also evaluate the leverage ratio  which is tier capital divided by average assets 
the bank intends to maintain regulatory capital in excess of the highest regulatory standard  referred to as well capitalized 
the bank routinely projects its capital levels by analyzing forecasted earnings  credit quality  securities valuation  shareholder dividends  asset volumes  share repurchase activity  and other factors 
capital ratios are reviewed by management on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is adequate to meet the bank s anticipated future needs 
for all periods presented  the bank s ratios exceed the regulatory definition of well capitalized as defined in the regulations issued by the fdic 
the bank s capital ratios have been computed in accordance with regulatory accounting guidelines 
the bank s capital adequacy ratios as of december  and are presented in the following table

the major source of the funds required is generally provided by payments and maturities of loans  sale of loans  liquidation of assets  deposit inflows  investment security maturities and paydowns  federal funds lines  fhlb advances  other borrowings and the acquisition of additional deposit liabilities 
one method that banks utilize for acquiring additional liabilities is through the acceptance of brokered deposits defined to include not only deposits received through deposit brokers  but also deposits bearing interest in excess of basis points over market rates  typically attracting large certificates of deposit at high interest rates  however it s managements intention to reduce fhlb advances and brokered deposits as a percentage of total funding over the next two years 
the bank s primary use of funds are for origination of loans  the purchase of investment securities  maturing cd s  demand and saving deposit withdrawals  repayment of borrowings and dividends to common shareholders 
to meet liquidity needs  the company maintains a portion of funds in cash deposits in other banks  federal funds sold  and investment securities 
as of december   liquid assets were comprised of in federal funds sold   in interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions   in cash and due from banks  and  in available for sale securities 
those liquid assets equaled of total assets at december  as of december   liquid assets were comprised of  in federal funds sold   in interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions   in cash and due from banks  and  in available for sale securities 
the liquid assets equaled of total assets at december  in addition to liquid assets  liquidity can be enhanced  if necessary  through short or long term borrowings 
the bank anticipates that the federal funds lines and fhlb advances will continue to be important sources of funding in the future  and management expects there to be adequate collateral for such funding requirements 
a decline in the bank s credit rating would adversely affect the bank s ability to borrow and or the related borrowing costs  thus impacting the bank s liquidity 
as of december   the bank has additional borrowing capacity including unsecured lines of credit totaling million with two correspondent banks and a million line of credit with the federal reserve bank of san francisco to borrow through the discount window  which were not drawn upon at december  the bank is also a member of the fhlb san francisco and has a line of credit through pledged loans and securities for advances of million  of which million was available at december  management anticipates that cash and cash equivalents on hand  deposits and borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity for its operating  investing and financing needs and its regulatory liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future  however  it s managements intention to reduce fhlb advances and brokered deposits as a percentage of total funding over the next two years 
for non banking functions  the company is dependent upon the payment of cash dividends from the bank to service its commitments 
the fdic and dfi have authority to prohibit the bank from engaging in activities that  in their opinion  constitute unsafe or unsound practices in conducting its business 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question and other factors  that the fdic and the dfi could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under some circumstances  be an unsafe or unsound practice 
furthermore  the fdic has established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by banks under its jurisdiction 
the company expects cash dividends paid by the bank to the company to be sufficient to meet payment schedules 
as of december  and december   there were  and  in dividends paid by the company to the shareholders  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million as of december   compared to million for the same period in the change was primarily the result of an increase in net income  provision for loan losses and loans originated for sale partially offset by proceeds from loan sales  net change in accrued interest receivable and other assets and loans transferred to available for sale 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million as of december   compared to million used by investing activities for the same period in the change was primarily the result of an increase in loans originated and purchase of investment securities available for sale partially offset by proceeds from sales of investment securities available for sale  maturity of investment securities available for sale and a decrease in the purchase of bank owned life insurance 
funds provided by financing activities totaled million as of december   compared to funds provided by financing activities of million for the same period in the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in deposits  fhlb advances and issuance of long term debt 
the company anticipates maintaining its cash levels in mainly through profitability and retained earnings 
it is anticipated that loan demand will be moderate during  although such demand will be dictated by economic and competitive conditions 
the company aggressively solicits non interest bearing demand deposits and money market checking deposit  which are the least sensitive to interest rates 
however  higher costing products  including money market savings and certificates of deposits  have been less stable during the recent period of increased rate competition from banks affected by the subprime and mortgage lending crisis 
the growth of deposit balances is subject to heightened competition and the success of the company s sales efforts and delivery of superior customer service 
depending on economic conditions  interest rate levels  and a variety of other conditions  deposit growth may be used to fund loans  purchase investment securities or to reduce short term borrowings 
however  due to concerns regarding uncertainty in the general economic environment  competition  and political uncertainty  loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the bank s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its loan and deposit functions 
the careful planning of asset and liability maturities and the matching of interest rates to correspond with this maturity matching is an integral part of the active management of an institution s net yield 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  net yields may be affected 
even with perfectly matched re pricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of assets  timing lags in adjusting certain assets and liabilities that have varying sensitivities to market interest rates and basis risk 
in an overall attempt to match assets and liabilities  the company takes into account rates and maturities to be offered in connection with the certificates of deposit and variable rate loans 
because of the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities  the company is negatively affected by the increasing interest rates 
conversely  the company would be positively affected in a decreasing rate environment 
the company has generally been able to control the exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining a large percentage of adjustable interest rate loans and the majority of the time certificates in relatively short maturities 
the majority of the loans have periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors 
the company has also controlled the interest rate risk exposure by locking in longer term fixed rate liabilities  including fhlb borrowings  brokered certificates of deposit  and non brokered wholesale certificates of deposit 
it s managements strategy to minimize the use of fhlb advances  brokered deposits and non brokered deposits beyond the need for interest rate risk management 
since interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously  a cumulative gap analysis alone cannot be used to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity position 
to supplement traditional gap analysis  the company performs simulation modeling to estimate the potential effects of changing interest rates 
the process allows the company to explore the complex relationships within the gap over time and various interest rate environments 
the following table shows the bank s cumulative gap analysis as of december  at december  within three months three to twelve months one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities federal funds interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions loans fhlb and pcbb stock total interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking money market and savings time deposits fhlb advances long term debt junior subordinated debentures total interest rate sensitivity gap cummulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of interest earning assets the target cumulative one year gap ratio is to 
the policy limit for net earnings at risk for a basis points change in rates is  indicating a worst case decrease in earnings given a basis point change in interest rates 
the policy limit for a basis points change in rates is  indicating a decrease in net interest income 
management strives to maintain rate sensitive assets on its books 
management also evaluates the use of fhlb products including longer term bullet advances  amortizing advances  and interest rate swaps as tools to control interest rate risk 
if one of the interest rate risk measures exceeds the policy limits  management adjusts product offerings and repositions assets and liabilities to bring the interest rate risk measure back within policy limits within a reasonable timeframe 
the current one year gap ratio is 
a negative gap indicates that in an increasing interest rate environment  it is expected that net interest margin would decrease  and in a decreasing interest rate environment  net interest margin would increase 
the company believes that there are some inherent weaknesses in utilizing the cumulative gap analysis as a means of monitoring and controlling interest rate risk 
specifically  the cumulative gap analysis does not address loans at their floor rates that cannot reset as rates change and does not incorporate varying prepayment speeds as interest rates change 
the company  therefore  relies more heavily on the dynamic simulation model to monitor and control interest rate risk 
interest rate sensitivity the company uses a dynamic simulation model to forecast the anticipated impact of changes in market interest rates on its net interest income and economic value of equity 
sensitivity of net interest income nii and capital to interest rate changes arises when yields on loans and investments change in a different time frame or amount from that of rates on deposits and other interest bearing liability 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the statement of condition is managed with the objective of correlating the movements of interest rates on loans and investments with those of deposits 
the asset and liability policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of change to nii and capital in changing interest rate environments 
the bank uses simulation models to forecast nii and capital 
simulation of nii and capital under various scenarios of increasing or decreasing interest rates is the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk 
using licensed software developed for this purpose  management is able to estimate the potential impact of changing rates 
a simplified statement of condition is prepared on a quarterly basis as a starting point  using as inputs  actual loans  investments and deposits 
in the simulation of nii and capital under various interest rate scenarios  the simplified statement of condition is processed against two interest rate change scenarios 
each of these scenarios assumes that the change in interest rates is immediate and interest rates remain at the new levels 
the model is used to assist management in evaluating and in determining and adjusting strategies designed to reduce its exposure to these market risks  which may include  for example  changing the mix of earning assets or interest bearing deposits 
the table below summarizes the effect on nii and capital due to changing interest rates as measured against the flat rate scenario 
estimated net interest income sensitivity estimated change in economic value of equity simulated rate changes basis points basis points basis points unchanged basis points basis points basis points as illustrated in the above table  the company is currently liability sensitive 
the implication of this is that the company s earnings will increase in a falling rate environment  as there are more rate sensitive liabilities subject to reprice downward than rate sensitive assets  conversely  earnings would decrease in a rising rate environment 
therefore  an increase in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
in contrast  a decrease in market rates may improve net interest income 
management believes that all of the assumptions used in the analysis to evaluate the vulnerability of its projected net interest income and economic value of equity to changes in interest rates approximate actual experiences and considers them to be reasonable 
however  the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on the bank s projected net interest income and economic value of equity may vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the projections on which they are based 
the asset liability committee meets quarterly to monitor the investments  liquidity needs and oversee the asset liability management 
in between meetings of the committee  management oversees the liquidity management 
return on equity and assets the following table sets forth key ratios for the periods ended december    and as of december  net income as a percentage of average assets net income as a percentage of average equity average equity as a percentage of average assets dividends declared per share as a percentage of net income per share in  the company grew its earning asset base  produced additional other income and increased the dividends declared to per share in november from per share in january and per share in may and august dividends declared were per share in may and august  respectively  and increased to per share in november inflation the impact of inflation on a financial institution can differ significantly from that exerted on other companies 
banks  as financial intermediaries  have many assets and liabilities that may move in concert with inflation both as to interest rates and value 
however  financial institutions are affected by inflation s impact on noninterest expenses  such as salaries  benefits and occupancy expenses 
because of the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities  the bank tends to benefit in the short term from a decreasing interest rate market and suffer in an increasing interest rate market 
the management of federal funds rate by the federal reserve has an impact on the company s earnings such that changes in interest rates may have a corresponding impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans with the bank 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit 
to varying degrees  these instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instruments for undisbursed loan funds and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
at december  and december   the amounts of the company s undisbursed loan and line of credit funds were million and million  respectively  and there were no obligations under standby and commercial letters of credit in either period 
refer to the consolidated financial statements for more qualitative and quantitative disclosures about financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure aobut market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
although the company manages other risks  for example  credit quality and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be a principal market risk 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the majority of the company s interest rate risk arises from instruments  positions and transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
they include loans  securities available for sale  deposit liabilities  short term borrowings and long term debt 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change 
the company manages interest rate risk through its asset liability committee alco 
the alco monitors exposure to interest rate risk on a quarterly basis using both a traditional gap analysis and simulation analysis 
traditional gap analysis identifies short and long term interest rate positions or exposure 
simulation analysis uses an income simulation approach to measure the change in interest income and expense under rate shock conditions 
the model considers the three major factors of a volume differences  b repricing differences and c timing in its income simulation 
the model begins by disseminating data into appropriate repricing buckets based on internally supplied algorithms or overridden by calibration 
next  each major asset and liability type is assigned a multiplier or beta to simulate how much that particular balance sheet category type will reprice when interest rates change 
the model uses numerous asset and liability multipliers consisting of bank specific or default multipliers 
the remaining step is to simulate the timing effect of assets and liabilities by modeling a month by month simulation to estimate the change in interest income and expense over the next month period 
the results are then expressed as the change in pre tax net interest income over a month period for  and shocks
