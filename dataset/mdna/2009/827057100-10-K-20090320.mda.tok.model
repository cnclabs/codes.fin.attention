item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation related party transactions 
we do not have any long term contracts with spt  pct or silicon professional alliance corporation  or spac  another subsidiary of pct 
spt  pct or spac may cease providing services to us at any time 
if spt  pct or spac were to terminate their relationship with us we would experience a delay in reestablishing warehousing  logistics and distribution functions  and it could impair our ability to collect accounts receivable from spt and may harm our business 
in addition if spt were to experience financial difficulty  our collection of our accounts receivable could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 
we depend on a limited number of foreign foundries to manufacture our products  and these foundries may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which could cause our revenues to decline 
we outsource substantially all of our manufacturing and testing activities 
we currently buy all of our wafers and sorted die from a limited number of suppliers 
the majority of our products are manufactured by four foundries  grace and hhnec in china  tsmc in taiwan  and seiko epson corporation 
we have an equity investment in gsmc  a cayman islands company  which owns a wafer foundry subsidiary  grace in shanghai  china 
we anticipate that these foundries  together with samsung corporation in korea and powerchip semiconductor corporation  or psc  in taiwan will continue to manufacture substantially all of our products in the foreseeable future 
if these suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive prices we could suffer manufacturing delays  a possible loss of revenues or higher than anticipated costs of revenues  any of which could harm our operating results 
purchases from our top three suppliers accounted for of our costs of revenues in our revenues may be impacted by our ability to obtain adequate wafer supplies from our foundries 
the foundries with which we currently have arrangements  together with any additional foundry at which capacity might be obtained  may not be willing or able to satisfy all of our manufacturing requirements on a timely basis at favorable prices 
in addition  we have encountered delays in qualifying new products and in ramping up new product production and we could experience these delays in the future 
during the first quarter of  we experienced fabrication issues with one of our wafer foundries and capacity constraints for certain package types at one of our backend suppliers 
we are also subject to the risks of service disruptions  raw material shortages and price increases by our foundries 
such disruptions  shortages and price increases could harm our operating results 
manufacturing capacity has in the past been difficult to secure and if capacity constraints arise in the future our revenues may decline 
in order to grow  we need to increase our present manufacturing capacity 
the existing capacity from grace  hhnec and tsmc available were insufficient during we subsequently contracted for additional manufacturing capacity and do not expect capacity constraints in the forseeable future 
however  events that we have not foreseen could arise which would further limit our capacity 
similar to our investment in gsmc  we may determine that it is necessary to invest substantial capital in order to secure appropriate production capacity commitments 
if we cannot secure additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired and our operating results will be harmed 

table of contents our cost of revenues may increase if we are required to purchase manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases  loans  joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with wafer fabrication companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing if we need substantial capital in order to secure this capacity and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers have  from time to time  experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from marginal design or manufacturing process drift 
yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process  which often makes them difficult  time consuming and costly to correct 
furthermore  we rely on independent foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability  which could harm our operating results 
if our foundries discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade the technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may face production delays and lower revenues 
our wafer and product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture our products 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a foundry will cease production on an older or lower volume manufacturing process that it uses to manufacture our products 
additionally  we cannot be certain our foundries will continue to devote resources to advance the process technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based 
we are currently transitioning to lower geometries  and if our foundries are unable to successfully make this transition our business will be harmed 
either one of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time 
our dependence on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher costs of materials 
we depend on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties on the service they provide to us  potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
these risks may lead to increased costs  delayed product delivery or loss of competitive advantage  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 

table of contents because our flash memory products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
due to the flash memory product cycle we usually require more than nine months to realize volume shipments after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design in  which may take three months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional nine months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we expect that the current negative global economic conditions will continue to lengthen our sales cycles 
our success is dependent on the growth and strength of the flash memory market 
substantially all of our products  as well as all new products currently under design  are stand alone flash memory devices or devices embedded with flash memory 
a memory technology other than superflash may be adopted as an industry standard 
our competitors are generally in a better financial and marketing position than we are from which to influence industry acceptance of a particular memory technology 
in particular  a primary source of competition may come from alternative technologies such as fram or mram devices if such technology is commercialized for higher density applications 
to the extent our competitors are able to promote a technology other than superflash as an industry standard  our business will be harmed 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could harm sales of our products 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor memory components and have recently added significant capacity for such production 
our low density memory products  medium density memory products  and high density memory products  if we are successful in developing these products  face substantial competition 
in addition  we may in the future experience direct competition from our foundry partners 
we have licensed to our foundry partners the right to fabricate products based on our technology and circuit design  and to sell such products worldwide  subject to our receipt of royalty payments 
competition may also come from alternative technologies such as ferroelectric random access memory devices  or fram  magneto resistive random access memory  or mram  or other developing technologies 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working 
table of contents relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 
in addition  products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and incur significant expense to redesign our products and ensure compliance with relevant standards 
we believe that products for these applications will encounter intense competition and be highly price sensitive 
while we are currently developing and introducing new products for these applications  we cannot assure you that these products will reach the market on time  will satisfactorily address customer needs  will be sold in high volume  or will be sold at profitable margins 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
the high level of complexity and integration of our products increases the risk of latent defects  which could damage customer relationships and increase our costs 
our products are based upon evolving technology and are highly complex 
the integration of additional functions into already complex products could result in a greater risk that customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after we have already shipped significant quantities of a product 
although we test our products  we may in the future encounter defects or errors 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  product warranty costs for recall and replacement and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional personnel 
we are dependent on bing yeh  our president and chief executive officer  as well as the other principal members of our management team and engineering staff 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular the highly skilled design  applications and test engineers involved in the development of flash memory technology 
competition is especially intense in silicon valley  where our corporate headquarters are located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to recruit and retain key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could harm our business 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secrets  copyrights  mask work rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries 
litigation may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
as of december   we held patents in the united states relating to certain aspects of our products and processes  with expiration dates 
table of contents ranging from to and have filed for several more 
in addition  we hold several patents in europe  japan  korea  taiwan and china 
we cannot assure you that any pending patent application will be granted 
our operating results could be harmed by the failure to protect our intellectual property 
the matters relating to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements has resulted in litigation  which could harm our financial results 
in march  our board of directors determined to conduct a voluntary review of our historical stock option grant practices covering the time from our initial public offering in through the review was led by the chairman of the audit committee of the board of directors with the assistance of outside independent legal counsel  and began on or about march  as described further in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   the chairman of the audit committee reached the conclusion that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for stock option grants made in certain prior periods 
as a result  we recorded additional non cash stock based compensation expense  and related tax effects  related to stock option grants and restated our historical financial statements 
the review of our historical stock option granting practices required us to incur substantial expenses for legal  accounting  tax and other professional services  totaling million for in addition  the review diverted management s attention from our business  and could in the future harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are engaged in derivative suits  which may become time consuming  costly and divert management resources and could impact our stock price 
securities class action law suits are often brought against companies  particularly technology companies  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs and management resources in defending against such claims 
our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation 
as described in item legal proceedings  several derivative complaints have been filed against our directors and certain of our executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants 
the complaints were brought purportedly on behalf of sst against certain of our current and former officers and directors and allege  among other things  that the named officers and directors a breached their fiduciary duties as they colluded with each other to backdate stock options  b violated rule b of the securities exchange act of  and c were unjustly enriched by their receipt and retention of such stock options 
these or future similar complaints  or any future litigation may not result in the same conclusions reached by the chairman of the audit committee 
the conduct and resolution of these matters or other litigation will be time consuming  expensive and may distract management from the conduct of our business 
former employees may also bring lawsuits against us or engage us in arbitration relating to their stock options and other matters 
these lawsuits may be time consuming and expensive  and cause further distraction from the operation of our business 
the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we are also involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
there can be no assurance that the shareholder class action complaints  the shareholder derivative complaints or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring payments in the future which may adversely impact gross margins 
no estimate can be made of the possible loss or possible range of loss associated with the resolution of these contingencies 
as a result  no losses have been accrued in our financial statements as of december  
table of contents during the course of these lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending these matters  and at any time  additional claims may be filed against us  which could increase the risk  expense and duration of the litigation 
further  because of the amount of discovery required in connection with this type of litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
for more information with respect to our litigation  please also see item legal proceedings 
if we are accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose  we could suffer a significant impact on our business and be forced to pay damages 
third parties may assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay damages that could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
we receive from time to time  letters or communications from other companies stating that such companies have patent rights that involve our products 
since the design of most of our products is based on superflash technology  any legal finding that the use of our superflash technology infringes the patent of another company would have a significantly negative effect on our entire product line and operating results 
furthermore  if such a finding were made  there can be no assurance that we could license the other company s technology on commercially reasonable terms or that we could successfully operate without such technology 
moreover  if we are found to infringe  we could be required to pay damages to the owner of the protected technology and could be prohibited from making  using  selling  offering to sell or importing into the united states any products that infringe the protected technology 
in addition  the management attention consumed by and legal cost associated with any litigation could harm our operating results 
during the course of these lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
if an earthquake or other natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility or those of our suppliers  we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenues 
our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults 
in addition  some of our suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters  our operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster such as typhoon near one or more of our major suppliers  like the earthquakes in april and december or the typhoons in september and july that occurred in taiwan  could potentially disrupt the operations of those suppliers  which could then limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  could harm our business 
terrorist attacks in the united states or abroad against american interests or citizens  us retaliation for these attacks  threats of additional terrorist activity and the war in iraq have caused our customer base to become more cautious 
any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers  distributors and suppliers  affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products  or affect the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer spending in particular  which could harm our business 

table of contents a virus or viral outbreak in asia could harm our business 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from asia and our logistics center is located in taiwan 
a virus or viral outbreak in asia  such as the sars outbreak in early or threat of the avian flu  could harm the operations of our suppliers  distributors  logistics center and those of our end customers  which could harm our business 
prolonged electrical power outages  energy shortages  or increased costs of energy could harm our business 
our design and process research and development facilities and our corporate offices are located in california  which is susceptible to power outages and shortages as well as increased energy costs 
to limit this exposure  all corporate computer systems at our main california facilities are on battery back up 
in addition  all of our engineering and back up servers and selected corporate servers are on generator back up 
while the majority of our production facilities are not located in california  more extensive power shortages in the state could delay our design and process research and development as well as increase our operating costs 
our growth has in the past placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources and if we fail to manage our growth  our ability to market or sell our products or develop new products may be harmed 
our business has in the past experienced rapid growth which strained our internal systems and future growth will require us to continuously develop sophisticated information management systems in order to manage our business effectively 
we have implemented a supply chain management system and a vendor electronic data interface system 
there is no guarantee that these measures  in themselves  will be adequate to address any growth  or that we will be able to foresee in a timely manner other infrastructure needs before they arise 
our success depends on the ability of our executive officers to effectively manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our results of operations will be harmed 
if we fail to successfully implement new management information systems  our business may suffer severe inefficiencies that may harm the results of our operations 
if we determine that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the year ended december  and will continue to do so for future fiscal periods 
we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review  evaluation  and the implementation of improvements 
additionally  management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may identify deficiencies that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors 
the restatement of financial statements for the years ended december  through december  in prior filings with the sec is a strong indicator of the existence of a material weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting 
we concluded that the control deficiencies that resulted in the restatement of the previously issued consolidated financial statements were remediated  and thus concluded that the control deficiencies relating to our historical stock option grant practices that resulted in the restatement of the previously issued financial statements did not constitute a material weakness as of december  additionally  as of december  and and the quarter and nine months ended september   we did not maintain effective controls over the completeness  accuracy  valuation and presentation and disclosure of inventory and the related cost of revenue accounts 
specifically  our controls over the recording of inventory 
table of contents adjustments resulting from physical inventory observations  capitalization of production variances into inventory and valuation of inventory related reserves in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  were not effective 
these control deficiencies resulted in audit adjustments to the and consolidated annual financial statements and to the interim financial statements for the quarters ended march  and september   that required remediation 
management implemented a remediation plan and remediated the material weaknesses as of december  should we determine in future fiscal periods that we have additional material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  the reliability of our financial reports may be impacted  and our results of operations or financial condition may be harmed and the price of our common stock may decline 
future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  we adopted sfas no 
r in the first quarter of which requires us to record charges to earnings for the stock options we grant and purchases of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  sec regulations and nasdaq marketplace rules are creating uncertainty for public companies 
we continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we have invested resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment has resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and we may be harmed 
acquisitions could result in operating difficulties  dilution and other harmful consequences 
in the past five years we have acquired emosyn  llc  a fabless semiconductor manufacturer specializing in the design and marketing of smart card ics for sim applications  g plus  inc  a semiconductor manufacturer specializing in the design and marketing of radio frequency ics and monolithic microwave ics and actrans systems inc  a fabless semiconductor company that designs flash memory and eeproms 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  technologies  services  products and other assets  including interests in our existing subsidiaries and joint ventures 
at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of such transactions 
any such transactions could be 
table of contents material to our financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that any such discussions or negotiations will result in the consummation of any transaction 
the process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky 
the areas where we may face difficulties include diversion of management time  as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues of integration and future products  declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  the need to integrate each company s accounting  management information  human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management  and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls  procedures and policies  and in some cases  the need to transition operations onto our technology platforms 
international acquisitions involve additional risks  including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages  currency risks  and the particular economic  political  and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 
moreover  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions 
as a result of future acquisitions or mergers  we might need to issue additional equity securities  spend our cash  or incur debt  contingent liabilities  or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading supplier of nor flash memory semiconductor devices for the digital consumer  networking  wireless communications and internet computing markets 
nor flash memory is a form of nonvolatile memory that allows electronic systems to retain information when the system is turned off 
nor flash memory is now used in hundreds of millions of consumer electronics and computing products annually 
we produce and sell many products based on our superflash design and manufacturing process technology 
our products are incorporated into products sold by many well known companies including apple  asustek  benq  cisco  dell  first international computer  gigabyte  haier  huawei  infineon  intel  ibm  inventec  legend  lenovo  lg electronics  freescale semiconductor  nec  nintendo  panasonic  philips  quanta  samsung  sanyo  seagate  sony  sony ericsson  toshiba  texas instruments  vtech and zte 
we also produce and sell other semiconductor products including flash microcontrollers  smart card ics and modules  radio frequency ics and modules  nand controllers and nand controller based modules 
one of our goals is diversification through the active development of our non memory business 
our objective is to transform sst from a pure play in flash memory to a multi product line semiconductor company and a leading licensor of embedded flash technology 
we continue to execute on our plan to derive a significant portion of our revenue from non memory products  which includes flash microcontrollers  nand controller based modules  smart card ics and radio frequency ics and modules 
we believe non memory products represent an area in which we have significant competitive advantages and also an area that  in the long run  can yield profitable revenue with higher and more stable gross margins than our memory products 
we may also explore strategic alternatives such as acquisitions or investments in other businesses 
our product strategy is two fold to continue to develop and grow our core nor flash memory and embedded flash technology licensing business  while diversifying our business by expanding into new markets and pursuing growth opportunities through the development of new nand controller based module and radio frequency ic products 
in the nor flash market  our goals are to be the leading worldwide supplier of low density nor flash memory devices and to maintain our position as the world s number one embedded flash licensor by growing both upfront fees and per unit royalties 
in our new business markets  our objectives are to leverage our core competencies in nand controller design into systems solutions as adoption of solid state memory technology grows  and to leverage our radio frequency wireless technology and systems expertise as development continues on a multitude of electronic devices which are enabled for wireless communication 
the board of directors has appointed a strategic committee to review our investments and to investigate strategic alternatives  including acquisitions and divestitures 
the strategic committee is working closely with management and an outside consultant to evaluate our operations and products  and identify potential new business opportunities 
this evaluation involves all aspects of our business in order to drive value for our shareholders and position sst for future growth 

table of contents market conditions and global reorganization the unprecedented sudden decrease in demand for semiconductor products during the fourth quarter of  resulting from the deepening global financial crisis  has caused a significant decline in our revenues 
this decline in demand is evident in our results  with revenue from nearly all application segments down significantly in the fourth quarter of  as compared with the third quarter 
the digital consumer segment saw especially sharp declines  with fourth quarter revenues decreasing more than from the third quarter 
this persistent difficult economic environment necessitated that we accelerate certain planned changes to our business and focus 
we took important steps to reduce our inventory  streamline our organizational structure and reduce our expenses by focusing our efforts on our most strategic initiatives 
in december  we announced the implementation of a global reorganization designed to reflect changes in anticipated demand for our products 
this action was taken to reduce costs of operations  realign our development priorities  and to improve our focus on accelerating time to market of select new products 
this refined strategy continues the essential elements of diversification by focusing on a reduced number of projects in the areas of non commodity nor products  nand controllers and modules and radio frequency products which are synergistic with our memory markets 
we believe this focus on a smaller set of projects  along with the reduction in operating expenses  will ultimately make our company more profitable and enhance shareholder value 
the reorganization included a reduction in overall headcount of approximately  or percent of our global workforce  most of which was completed by the end of we incurred a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of  all of which is related to severance costs associated with the workforce reduction  and we expect to incur an additional restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of the workforce reduction and other restructuring actions took place worldwide and in all functional areas of the company  and are expected to reduce payroll related expenses by approximately million in in review over the past years  we have established ourselves as an industry leader with our superior superflash technology  deep customer relationships and a talented team of employees dedicated to a common goal of excellence 
several years ago  with the recognition that our core memory business will continue to experience average selling price pressure that would limit our revenue growth potential  we began a diversification plan of investing in products and technologies that are expected to yield average selling prices  or asps  that are higher than our current memory products 
we believe that a strategy of diversification will allow for better growth opportunities and higher return for our shareholders 
we have invested internally and externally on new technologies designed to enhance our competitive position  and have received strong initial market response to many of our initiatives 
in the fourth quarter of  our non memory products contributed of overall product revenue and of product gross profit 
through our recent focus on executing this diversification strategy  we have achieved important milestones on several new products and technologies  including nandrive  a high performance  small form factor solid state drive 
our nandrive products contain an integrated ata controller and nand memory in a multichip package and are used as a basic building block for storage in a wide variety of applications 
during  we expanded our nandrive family of products with the addition of mbyte  gbyte  gbyte and gbyte products  capable of operating at industrial temperature ranges  making them compelling storage options in harsh environments including medical equipment  factory automation and automotive electronics 
since introduction  our customer base for the nandrive family has continued to grow  with early success coming from applications such as ip set top boxes  mobile internet devices and industrial applications 
in  we saw the first meaningful revenue from our nandrive devices  with total shipments in excess of  units  and we continue to work on many design in opportunities 
as we ramp up production at this early stage of product cycle  we expect to see significant fluctuations both in quarterly revenue and unit shipments 

table of contents radio frequency power amplifiers 
using advanced technologies  these devices feature a highly efficient  low power  small footprint design that supports wireless standard 
we are beginning to see traction in the adoption of our radio frequency ics and modules  targeted at a wide range of wireless and multimedia applications  including cell phones 
we shipped nearly million units in and expect continued growth in due to the complexity of these new product families  the design in and qualification cycle is expected to be long  and we further expect our near term results to be significantly impacted by the challenging overall economic environment 
despite the current economic and competitive challenges  we continued to develop our core flash memory business and we believe we are well positioned in our memory product business as well as our as well as our complementary technology licensing business 
as an increasing number of electronic products have been designed around microprocessors and microcontrollers  virtually all of these products incorporate some low density nor flash memory for code storage 
in many cases  the code size for each product is also increasing as consumers demand more features and functionality 
further  as the definition of low density continues to expand into  and mbit densities  we believe this creates an opportunity for us and gives strong evidence that our core business will benefit from market growth in the future 
we address this market with feature rich  cost effective products which allow us to support a very broad range of applications 
for applications requiring smaller memory  we offer embedded superflash technology through licensing agreements 
our investment in producing innovative solutions continues to build on the success of our memory business  and during we announced three developments in nor flash memory products 
first  we announced the series serial quad i o sqi family of bit multiplexed i o serial interface flash memory devices 
the series high data rate  combined with low pin count and enhanced serial interface architecture  provide an ideal code storage solution for applications such as ultra low cost handsets  bluetooth headsets  optical disk drives and gps devices 
the second was a new addition to our v spi serial flash product family  a mbit  small form factor product which is ideal for battery powered  space constrained mobile applications 
third  we announced a collaboration with freescale semiconductor  in which our spi serial flash devices enable freescale s latest products to deliver dramatically enhanced battery life 
also  in the area of memory technologies  we are continuing to reduce manufacturing costs through the transition to more advanced process technologies that generally carry a lower cost per die 
during we successfully brought up our nm technology at both grace and powerchip  foundries which we expect to produce a majority of our products in five products have been released to production from these lines and four more are under verification and qualification 
these products include the  and mbit parallel and serial family of products  which we believe will provide the proper cost structure to remain competitive in the broader commodity memory market 
outlook we have experienced a rapid deterioration in our booking activities since september  as our customers delayed their purchase orders in response to the sudden slowdown in consumer demand 
booking activities remained weak through the fourth quarter of and early our customers continue to report a lack of demand visibility and we believe there is still inventory in the sales channels that will need to be absorbed before bookings will accurately reflect demand 
our own inventory has declined significantly from the end of the third quarter of  as we carefully monitor customer requirements and have adjusted wafer starts accordingly 
we expect to reduce our inventory level further in the first quarter of the global reorganization and reduction in workforce is being conducted in a manner that we believe will best enable us to support the current and future requirements of our customer base and invest appropriately in our technology roadmap in order to enhance both our shorter and longer term competitive position 
our objective is to continue to execute on our strategy of diversification and the advancement of our technology through 
table of contents collaborated efforts with our strategic partners  while reducing operating expenses 
our fabless business model  in conjunction with our technology leadership  has been resilient during past business cycle downturns and we look forward to emerging stronger from this challenging environment 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by periodic changes in business conditions caused by product supply and demand imbalance 
when the industry experiences downturns  they often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns are characterized by weak product demand  excessive inventory and accelerated decline of selling prices 
our current operating environment represents such a downturn and we cannot predict the extent or duration of the downturn

our product sales are made primarily using short term cancelable purchase orders 
the quantities actually purchased by the customer  as well as shipment schedules  are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s needs and in our supply of product 
accordingly  our backlog of open purchase orders at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
changes in the amount of our backlog do not necessarily reflect a corresponding change in the level of actual or potential sales

december  december  december  memory revenue non memory revenue product revenues technology licensing total net revenues the following discussions are based on our reportable segments described in note segment and geographic reporting to our consolidated financial statements 
memory products memory product revenue decreased in from  primarily due to the overall reduction in demand for semiconductor products caused by the global economic downturn 
in  as compared with  both unit shipments and average selling prices decreased across all memory product families  and were down and  respectively 
although unit shipments for serial flash products decreased in from  average selling prices remained relatively stable  down only memory revenue decreased in from primarily due to supply constraints due to wafer shortages from our foundry sources 
these shortages led to orders that could not be fulfilled and forced us to be more selective in order acceptance 
as a result  certain revenue opportunities were lost due to our inability to produce an adequate supply of products 
while overall unit shipments increased for  average selling prices declined due to continuing competitive pricing pressures in low density markets 
we anticipate that memory product revenues will decline again in the first quarter of  and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
non memory products non memory product revenue increased in from  with a decrease in unit shipments of  led by smart card ic  offset by an increase in average selling prices of  due to product mix 
the decrease in unit shipments for smart card ic was due in part to our decision to focus on sales of higher margin products 
the favorable mix primarily reflects the introduction of our nandrive family of products 
non memory revenue decreased substantially in from supply constraints  a decrease in units shipped and a decrease in average selling prices all led to the decline 
the decline was led by nand controller shipments which declined for decreases of average selling prices in non memory products in were mainly due to pricing pressures on smart card ics 
we expect non memory product revenue to fluctuate significantly throughout due to the current adverse economic conditions  as well as the start up nature of our new product lines and diversification in our customer base 

table of contents technology licensing revenue technology licensing revenue includes a combination of up front fees and royalties 
technology licensing revenue increased in from  with the increase coming from royalties  primarily due to an ongoing trend toward flash technology within microcontroller markets 
technology licensing revenue for increased over primarily due to increased royalties from our licensees

average selling prices declined somewhat  as a result of the generally competitive industry environment 
gross profit for was also negatively impacted by inventory write downs of million  primarily on our serial flash and combomemory products  due to quantities in excess of forecasted demand and declining average selling prices 
comparatively  in  high demand coupled with capacity constraints resulted in low inventory levels and favorable cost variances from the sale of products for which we had previously taken write downs 
gross profit for memory products in increased from while supply constraints caused a loss of revenue  it also forced us to review existing business carefully and allowed us to pursue the most profitable opportunities 
as a result  we concentrated on sales of higher margin products with just a increase in units shipped over overall memory gross margins were up as a result of shipping more profitable products  despite an decrease in average selling prices 
we expect memory product margins to fluctuate significantly in the future due to changes in sales volume  product mix  average selling prices and inventory write downs 

table of contents non memory products gross profit for non memory products increased in from  despite a reduction in overall unit shipments and the generally weak economic environment 
the increase in gross profit was due to higher unit shipments and stable average selling prices for nandrive and microcontroller products  which was partially offset by a decrease in unit shipments for other non memory products and inventory write downs of million  primarily on smart card ic inventory 
gross profit for non memory products declined in from nand controller shipments declined by million units leading to the majority of the decline in gross profit 
in addition  supply constraints led to an overall decrease in unit shipments which  coupled with continuing pricing pressures on smart card  contributed to a decrease in average selling prices as well as a decrease in our overall non memory gross margins 
we expect non memory product margins to fluctuate significantly in the future due to changes in sales volume  product mix  average selling prices and inventory write downs

research and development expenses for increased by million  or from  due primarily to increases of million for product development related expenses including wafers  masks and evaluation parts and million for software and intellectual property licenses 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of  for salaries  bonuses and employee benefits  and  for stock based compensation 
research and development expenses for included a million charge to write off various intellectual property licenses  as we refined our focus toward our most strategic initiatives 
total expense related to compensation and benefits decreased in  as compared to  largely as a result of our emphasis on research and development activities in asia 
the decrease in expense for stock based compensation is due primarily to the accelerated expense recognition in of options granted in prior years  coupled with a reduction in the number of options granted to research and development personnel in for in comparison to  research and development expenses increased due to higher depreciation expense of  increased salaries and wages of million  additional software license fees of  and accruals for bonus programs of  increased research and development expenses were generally due to the ramp up of next generation products 

table of contents due to a sharp decline in booking activities and near term revenue forecasts in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a worldwide restructuring plan and reduced our overall headcount

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  cost of revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board 
the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market  provision for adverse purchase commitments  
table of contents warranty accrual  litigation losses  valuation of equity investments  goodwill  long lived assets  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  and fair value measurements 
revenue recognition 
sales to direct customers and foreign stocking representatives are recognized net of an allowance for estimated returns 
when product is shipped to direct customers or stocking representatives or by our distributors or spt to end users  prior to recognizing revenue  we also require that evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
legal title generally passes to our customers at the time our products are shipped 
payment terms typically range from to days 
sales to distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing price protection and the right of stock rotation on unsold merchandise 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and future returns  we defer recognition of such revenues  related costs of revenues and related gross profit until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
products shipped to spt are accounted for as our inventory held at our logistics center  and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
most of our technology licenses provide for the payment of up front fees and continuing royalties based on product sales 
for license and other arrangements for technology that we are continuing to enhance and refine  and under which we are obligated to provide unspecified enhancements  revenue is recognized over the lesser of the estimated period that we have historically enhanced and developed refinements to the technology  approximately two to three years the upgrade period  or the remaining portion of the upgrade period from the date of delivery  provided all specified technology and documentation has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
from time to time  we reexamine the estimated upgrade period relating to licensed technology to determine if a change in the estimated upgrade period is needed 
revenue from license or other technology arrangements where we are not continuing to enhance and refine technology or are not obligated to provide unspecified enhancements is recognized upon delivery  if the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
royalties received during the upgrade period under these arrangements are recognized as revenue based on the ratio of the elapsed portion of the upgrade period to the estimated upgrade period 
the remaining portions of the royalties are recognized ratably over the remaining portion of the upgrade period 
royalties received after the upgrade period has elapsed are recognized when reported to us which generally occurs one quarter in arrears and concurrently with the receipt of payment 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates in relation to the estimated period of technology enhancement and development  the amount and timing of our revenues from up front license fees and royalties could be materially affected 
allowance for sales returns 
we maintain an allowance for estimated product returns by our customers 
we estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  known returns we have not received and other estimates 
the allowance for sales returns was million  million and  as of december   and  respectively 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other estimates 
if we were to make different judgments of the financial condition of our customers or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required  which could materially impact our results of operations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was   and  as of december   and  respectively 
as of december   spt accounted for of our net accounts receivable balance 
if spt were to experience financial difficulty  our collection of accounts receivable could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of average future selling prices  and  if average selling prices are lower than our estimate  we may be required to reduce our inventory value to reflect the lower of cost or market 
our inventories include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we maintain allowance for inventory for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and those inventories carried at costs that are higher than their market values 
we review on hand inventory including inventory held at the logistic center for potential excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market exposure and adjust the level of inventory reserve accordingly 
for excess inventory analysis  we compare the inventory on hand with the forecasted demand 
demand is based on one year for packaged products and two years for products in die form 
for the obsolete inventory analysis  we review inventory items in detail and consider date code  customer base requirements  planned or recent product revisions  end of life plans and diminished market demand 
if we determine that market conditions are less favorable than those currently projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories and lower of cost or market reserves was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
provision for adverse purchase commitments 
we maintain a provision for adverse purchase commitments for in process orders at our vendors when we have recorded lower of cost or market valuation provision against our on hand inventory 
once production has begun against our purchase orders  we are committed to purchasing the inventory or  if we cancel the order  we are liable for all costs incurred up to the time of cancellation 
if we have written down our on hand inventory of the ordered product for lower of cost or market valuations  we must consider the impact to in process inventory at our vendor 
we evaluate our in purchase orders to determine the impact of canceling the order and the impact of purchasing the inventory at a cost higher than the estimated current market value 
if we determine that market conditions become less favorable than those currently projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required when the inventory is purchased 
the recorded provision for adverse purchase commitments was   and million as of december   and  respectively 
warranty accrual 
our products are generally subject to warranty and we provide for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we will replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the recorded value of our warranty accrual was   and  as of december   and  respectively 

table of contents litigation losses 
from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending these matters 
there can be no assurance that shareholder class action complaints  shareholder derivative complaints or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future  all of which may adversely impact net income 
as of december   no estimate can be made of the possible loss or a possible range of loss associated with the resolution of these contingencies and therefore we have not recorded any accrual for such costs 
if additional information becomes available such that we can estimate with a reasonable degree of certainty that there is a possible loss or a possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  such costs or estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations in the semiconductor industry 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results in these companies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying value of our equity investments was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
further  we may record additional such impairment charges in the future  which could be material to our results of operations 
investments in non marketable equity securities are inherently risky  and a number of these companies are likely to fail 
their success is dependent on product development  market acceptance  operational efficiency  and other key business success factors 
in addition  depending on their future prospects and market conditions  they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations  with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments would likely become impaired 
such impairment charges may have material impact on our results of operations 
we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects  b the technological feasibility of the investee s products and technologies  c the general market conditions in the investee s industry or geographic area  including adverse regulatory or economic changes  d factors related to the investee s ability to remain in business  such as the investee s liquidity  debt ratios  and the rate at which the investee is using its cash  and e the investee s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 
investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired  in which case the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established 
when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view  we write off the investment  since we consider the estimated fair value to be nominal 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and written down when impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our sfas no 
analysis 
we utilize a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a 
table of contents fair value based test 
in computing fair value of our reporting units  we use estimates of future revenues  costs and cash flows from such units 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities 
we perform this analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined the goodwill acquired from our acquisition of g plus and actrans had become impaired in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
we did not record any impairment charge related to goodwill in as of december   our recorded goodwill of million relates to our technology licensing segment 
long lived assets 
long lived assets include property and equipment  equity investments and intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of one to five years 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we estimate the future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  expected to result from the use of those assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
as part of our analysis  we determined  of long lived assets had been impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge to research and development to write off various intellectual property licenses  as we refined our focus toward our most strategic initiatives 
we did not record any other impairment charges related to long lived assets in stock based compensation 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
r with regard to equity based compensation  which requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
the fair value of stock options shares are estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires us to make subjective assumptions in implementing sfas no 
r  including expected stock price volatility  and estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the accelerated method 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the additional paid in capital pool  or apic pool  to determine if there are any tax shortfalls which require recognition in the consolidated statements of operations 
we use historical volatility as we believe it is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of volatility 
we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
if we determined that another method used to estimate expected volatility was more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for share based awards could change significantly 
higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant 
accounting for income taxes 
we currently maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
expected future us losses represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
during  and  we maintained a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
at december   and the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was million  million and million  respectively 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and 
table of contents measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
step one  recognition  requires a company to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
step two  measurement  is based on the largest amount of benefit  which is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin on january  was recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin was a million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
to the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 
the amount of interest and penalties accrued upon the adoption of fin and at december  was not material 
fair value measurements 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment tests  non financial assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination 
therefore  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of this statement did not impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition  but required additional disclosure for assets and liabilities measured at fair value

operating capital requirements we believe that our cash balances  together with funds we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
although our revenue projections for the next year have been adversely impacted by the rapid decline in demand for semiconductor products  we believe our available cash and marketable securities are sufficient to cover projected working capital requirements without significant gross profit contribution 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to seek additional borrowings or capital and  if so required  that such borrowing or capital will be available on acceptable terms 
factors that could affect our short term and long term cash used or generated from operations and as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include the average selling prices of our products  customer demand for our products  the need to secure future wafer production capacity from our suppliers  the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue  merger  acquisition or joint venture projects  investments in strategic business partners  unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  and the outcome of ongoing litigation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
currently  we do not hedge these foreign exchange rate exposures 
substantially all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce revenues and or result in operating losses 
in addition  a downturn in the economies of china  japan or taiwan could impair the value of our investments in companies with operations in these countries 
if we consider the value of these companies to be impaired  we will write off  or expense  some or all of our investments 
in  and  we recorded investment impairments of million  million and million  respectively 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of december  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
as of december   the carrying value of our available for sale investments approximated fair value
