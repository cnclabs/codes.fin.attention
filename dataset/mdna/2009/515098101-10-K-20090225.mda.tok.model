introduction landstar system  inc and its subsidiary  landstar system holdings  inc together referred to herein as landstar or the company  provide transportation services to a variety of market niches throughout the united states and to a lesser extent in canada  and between the united states and canada  mexico and other countries through its operating subsidiaries 
landstar s business strategy is to be a non asset based provider of transportation capacity and logistics services delivering safe  specialized transportation services  utilizing a network of independent commission sales agents  third party capacity providers and employees 
landstar focuses on providing transportation services which emphasize safety  customer service and information coordination among its independent commission sales agents  customers and capacity providers 
the company markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and utilizes third party capacity providers exclusively to transport customers freight 
the nature of the company s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue 
historically  the company reported the results of three operating segments the carrier segment  the global logistics segment and the insurance segment 
beginning in the thirteen week period ended march   the company revised the presentation format of its segment disclosure to consolidate the previously reported three segments to two segments the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment 
this change in segment reporting reflected increased centralization and consolidation of certain administrative and sales functions across all of the company s operating subsidiaries and the increased similarity of the services provided by the operations of the company s various operating subsidiaries  primarily with respect to truck brokerage services 
as a result of this change in presentation  the revenue and operating results formerly separated into the carrier and global logistics segments  together with corporate overhead  which was previously included as other in the segment information  were consolidated into the transportation logistics segment 
this change in segment reporting had no impact on the company s consolidated balance sheets  statements of income  statements of cash flows or statements of changes in shareholders equity for any periods 
this change in reporting also had no impact on reporting with respect to the insurance segment 
the transportation logistics segment markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents 
the transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of transportation and logistics services including truckload transportation  rail intermodal  air cargo and ocean cargo services  the arrangement of multimodal ground  air  ocean and rail moves and warehousing to a variety of industries including automotive products  paper  lumber and building products  metals  chemicals  foodstuffs  heavy machinery  retail  electronics  ammunition and explosives and military hardware 
in addition  landstar provides transportation services to other transportation companies including logistics and less than truckload service providers 
landstar also provides dedicated contract and logistics solutions  including freight optimization and less than truckload freight consolidations  expedited land and air delivery of time critical freight and the movement of containers via ocean 
each of the independent commission sales agents has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment 
truckload services primarily are provided for a wide range of general commodities  much of which are over irregular or non repetitive routes  utilizing dry and specialty vans and unsided trailers  including flatbed  drop deck and specialty trailers 
available truckload services also include short to long haul movement of containers by truck and expedited ground and dedicated power only truck capacity 
these services are provided by independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company under exclusive lease arrangements the bco independent contractors and other third party truck capacity providers under non exclusive contractual arrangements truck brokerage carriers 
rail intermodal  air and ocean services are provided by third party railroad carriers and air and ocean cargo carriers 
the company has contracts with all 
table of contents of the class domestic railroads and certain canadian railroads and contracts with domestic and international airlines and ocean lines 
warehousing services are provided by independent contractors who provide warehouse capacity to the company under non exclusive contractual arrangements warehouse capacity owners 
during the fiscal year ended december   revenue hauled by bco independent contractors  truck brokerage carriers  rail intermodal carriers  air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers represented     and  respectively  of the company s transportation logistics segment revenue 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended december   revenue for passenger bus capacity provided for evacuation assistance related to the storms that impacted the gulf coast in september bus revenue represented of the company s transportation logistics segment revenue in the insurance segment is comprised of signature insurance company signature  a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary  and risk management claim services  inc the insurance segment provides risk and claims management services to landstar s operating subsidiaries 
in addition  it reinsures certain risks of the company s bco independent contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to landstar s operating subsidiaries 
revenue  representing premiums on reinsurance programs provided to the company s bco independent contractors  at the insurance segment represented approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  changes in financial condition and results of operations management believes the company s success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers 
management believes the most significant factors to the company s success include increasing revenue  sourcing capacity and controlling costs 
while customer demand  which is subject to overall economic conditions  ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue  the company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities 
management s primary focus with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate million or more of landstar revenue million dollar agents 
management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by million dollar agents and the number of million dollar agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents 
management believes the decrease in number of million dollar agents in resulted from the severe downturn in the economy in the fourth quarter of and not necessarily from agent turnover 
the number of agents generating landstar revenue between  and  in and were and  respectively 
the following table shows the number of million dollar agents  the average revenue generated by these agents  the percent of consolidated revenue generated by these agents during the past three fiscal years and the number of agent locations at each fiscal year end fiscal year number of million dollar agents average revenue generated per million dollar agent percent of consolidated revenue generated by million dollar agents number of independent commission sales agent locations at year end 
table of contents management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads volume and revenue per load by mode of transportation 
revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price 
those factors include the average length of haul  freight type  special handling and equipment requirements and delivery time requirements 
for shipments involving two or more modes of transportation  revenue is classified by the mode of transportation having the highest cost for the load 
the following table summarizes this data by mode of transportation for the past three fiscal years fiscal year revenue generated through in thousands bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean cargo carriers air cargo carriers other number of loads bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean cargo carriers air cargo carriers revenue per load bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail intermodal ocean cargo carriers air cargo carriers includes premium revenue generated by the insurance segment and warehousing revenue generated by the transportation logistics segment

 dec 
 bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers approved and active other approved total available truck capacity providers number of trucks provided by bco independent contractors active refers to truck brokerage carriers who moved at least one load in the days immediately preceding the fiscal year end 
the company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to agents 
the company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims 
in addition  the company incurs selling  general and administrative costs essential to administering its business operations 
management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the company and establishes annual cost budgets which  in general  are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis 
purchased transportation represents the amount a transportation capacity provider is paid to haul freight 
the amount of purchased transportation paid to a bco independent contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue generated by the haul 
purchased transportation paid to a truck brokerage carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed upon rate 
purchased transportation paid to rail intermodal  air cargo and ocean cargo carriers is based on contractually agreed upon fixed rates 
purchased transportation paid to bus capacity providers was based on a contractually agreed upon rate 
purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue with respect to services provided by truck brokerage carriers  rail intermodal carriers  ocean cargo carriers and bus capacity providers is normally higher than that provided by bco independent contractors and air cargo carriers 
purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and  on a consolidated basis  increases or decreases in proportion to the revenue generated through bco independent contractors and other third party capacity providers and revenue from the insurance segment 
purchased transportation costs are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery 
commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed upon percentages of revenue or gross profit  defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation 
no commissions to agents were incurred in connection with the bus revenue 
commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation and the insurance segment and with changes in gross profit on services provided by truck brokerage carriers  rail intermodal carriers  air cargo carriers  ocean cargo carriers and bus capacity providers 
commissions to agents are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery 
rent and maintenance costs for company provided trailing equipment  bco independent contractor recruiting costs and bad debts from bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents are the largest components of other operating costs 
potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable

the company also retains liability for each general liability claim up to   for each workers compensation claim and  for each cargo claim 
for cargo claims incurred prior to may   the company retains cargo liability up to  per occurrence 
the company s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by truck brokerage carriers  rail intermodal carriers  air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents  cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on landstar s results of operations 
employee compensation and benefits account for over half of the company s selling  general and administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment and management information services equipment

the credit agreement  which expires on june   provides  of borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility   of which may be utilized in the form of letter of credit guarantees 
the initial borrowing of  under the credit agreement was used to refinance  of outstanding borrowings under the prior credit agreement  which was terminated in connection with entering into the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains a number of covenants that limit  among other things  the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the company is required to  among other things  maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  and maintain a leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  below a specified maximum 
the credit agreement provides for a restriction on cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders on the company s capital stock to the extent there is a default under the credit agreement 
in addition  the credit agreement under certain circumstances limits the amount of such cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders in the event that after giving effect to any payment made to effect such cash dividend or other distribution  the leverage ratio would exceed to on a pro forma basis as of the end of the company s most recently completed fiscal quarter 
the credit agreement provides for an event of default in the event  among other things  that a person or group acquires or more of the outstanding capital stock of the company or obtains power to elect a majority of the company s directors

in addition  the company has  in letters of credit outstanding  as collateral for insurance claims  that are secured by investments and cash equivalents totaling  investments  all of which are carried at fair value  consist of investment grade bonds having maturities of up to five years 
fair value of investments is based primarily on quoted market prices 
historically  the company has generated sufficient operating cash flow to meet its debt service requirements  fund continued growth  both internal and through acquisitions  complete or execute share purchases of its common stock under authorized share purchase programs  pay dividends and meet working capital needs 
as a non asset based provider of transportation capacity and logistics services  the company s annual capital requirements for operating property are generally for trailing equipment and management information services equipment 
in addition  a significant portion of the trailing equipment used by the company is provided by third party capacity providers  thereby reducing the company s capital requirements

legal matters as further described in periodic and current reports previously filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission  the company and certain of its subsidiaries the defendants are defendants in a suit the litigation brought in the united states district court for the middle district of florida the district court by the owner operator independent drivers association  inc ooida and four former 
table of contents bco independent contractors the named plaintiffs and  with ooida  the plaintiffs on behalf of all independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company and its subsidiaries under exclusive lease arrangements the bco independent contractors 
the plaintiffs allege that certain aspects of the company s motor carrier leases and related practices with its bco independent contractors violate certain federal leasing regulations and seek injunctive relief  an unspecified amount of damages and attorneys fees 
on march   the district court denied the request by plaintiffs for injunctive relief  entered a judgment in favor of the defendants and issued written orders setting forth its rulings related to the decertification of the plaintiff class and other important elements of the litigation relating to liability  injunctive relief and monetary relief 
the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit the appellate court of certain of the district court s rulings in favor of the defendants 
the defendants asked the appellate court to affirm such rulings and filed a cross appeal with the appellate court with respect to certain other rulings of the district court 
on september   the appellate court issued its ruling  which  among other things  affirmed the district court s rulings that i the defendants are not prohibited by the applicable federal leasing regulations from charging administrative or other fees to bco independent contractors in connection with voluntary programs offered by the defendants through which a bco independent contractor may purchase discounted products and services for a charge that is deducted against the compensation payable to the bco independent contractor a charge back deduction  ii the plaintiffs are not entitled to restitution or disgorgement with respect to violations by defendants of the applicable federal leasing regulations but instead may recover only actual damages  if any  which they sustained as a result of any such violations and iii the claims of bco independent contractors may not be handled on a class action basis for purposes of determining the amount of actual damages  if any  they sustained as a result of any violations 
further  the analysis of the appellate court confirmed the absence of any violations alleged by the plaintiffs of the federal leasing regulations with respect to the written terms of all leases currently in use between the defendants and bco independent contractors 
however  the ruling of the appellate court reversed the district court s rulings i that an old version of the lease formerly used by defendants but not in use with any current bco independent contractor complied with applicable disclosure requirements under the federal leasing regulations with respect to adjustments to compensation payable to bco independent contractors on certain loads sourced from the us dept 
of defense  and ii that the defendants had provided sufficient documentation to bco independent contractors under the applicable federal leasing regulations relating to how the component elements of charge back deductions were computed 
the appellate court then remanded the case to the district court to permit the plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief with respect to these violations of the federal leasing regulations and to hold an evidentiary hearing to give the named plaintiffs an opportunity to produce evidence of any damages they actually sustained as a result of such violations 
each of the parties to the litigation has filed a petition with the appellate court seeking rehearing of the appellate court s ruling  however  there can be no assurance that any petition for rehearing will be granted 
although no assurances can be given with respect to the outcome of the litigation  including any possible award of attorneys fees to the plaintiffs  the company believes that i no plaintiff has sustained any actual damages as a result of any violations by the defendants of the federal leasing regulations and ii injunctive relief  if any  that may be granted by the district court on remand is unlikely to have a material adverse financial effect on the company 
the company is involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business 
based on knowledge of the facts and  in certain cases  opinions of outside counsel  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such other claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome  after provisions therefor  will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company  but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management s estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected 
historically  management s estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct 
during  the company experienced a higher level of customer bad debt expense than experienced in any of the previous five years 
management believes this resulted from the difficult economic environment experienced by the company s customers 
although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at december  is appropriate  a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables 
conversely  a more robust economic environment may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables 
landstar provides for the estimated costs of self insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis 
the amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date 
the ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management 
the company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim 
historically  the company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior year claims estimates 
during fiscal years  and  insurance and claims costs included   and  respectively  of favorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims reserve at december  the company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes 
upon audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
certain of these tax planning strategies result in a level of uncertainty as to whether the related tax positions taken by the company will result in a recognizable benefit 
the company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to such tax positions due to the corresponding level of uncertainty with respect to the amount of income tax benefit that may ultimately be realized 
management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the uncertainty in such income tax positions is appropriate 
to date  the company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the company s past provisions for exposures related to the uncertainty of such income tax positions are not appropriate 
significant variances from management s estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables  the ultimate resolution of self insured claims or the provision for uncertainty in income tax positions can all be expected to positively or negatively affect landstar s earnings in a given quarter or year 
however  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items  given a range of reasonably likely outcomes  will not significantly affect the long term financial condition of landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations 
effects of inflation management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of landstar in the past five years 
however  inflation higher than that experienced in the past five years might have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
seasonality landstar s operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry 
results of operations for the quarter ending in march are typically lower than the quarters ending june  september and december

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its financing activities  primarily its borrowings on the revolving credit facility  and investing activities with respect to investments held by the insurance segment 
on june   landstar entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent the credit agreement

as of december   the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding was 
during the fourth quarter of  the average outstanding balance under the credit agreement was approximately  based on the borrowing rates in the credit agreement and the repayment terms  the fair value of the outstanding borrowings as of december  was estimated to approximate carrying value 
assuming that debt levels on the credit agreement remain at  the balance at december   a hypothetical increase of basis points in current rates provided for under the credit agreement is estimated to result in an increase in interest expense of  on an annualized basis 
all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are payable on june   the expiration date of the credit agreement
