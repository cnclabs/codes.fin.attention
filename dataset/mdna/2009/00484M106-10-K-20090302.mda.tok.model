item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
background since we commenced operations in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the identification  development and commercialization of novel therapies that improve neurological function in people with ms  sci and other disorders of the cns 
our marketed drug  zanaflex capsules  is fda approved for the management of spasticity 
we announced positive results from a phase clinical trial of our lead product candidate  fampridine sr  for the improvement of walking ability in people with ms in september a second phase trial of fampridine sr in ms  ms f  was initiated in june and favorable results from that study were released in june the objective of this study was to show that individuals treated with fampridine sr are significantly more likely to have consistent improvements in their walking than those treated with placebo 
a thorough qt cardiac study was initiated in september and favorable results from that study were released in january this study evaluated the potential to cause an increase in the electrocardiographic qt interval 
fampridine sr  at both therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses  was found to be no different than placebo 
on january   we submitted a new drug application to the fda for fampridine sr 
we have also discussed fampridine sr with national regulatory authorities of four european union member states and believe that the current data are sufficient to file a centralized maa with the european medicines agency 
we are in discussions with potential marketing partners regarding the commercialization of fampridine sr in the european union and other non us markets 
at the same time  we are preparing for the filing of a centralized maa with the emea 
we plan to maintain our flexibility in the timing of such a filing in order to optimize our ex us commercialization pathway and availability to patients 
we believe fampridine sr is the first potential therapy in late stage clinical development for ms that seeks to improve the function of damaged nerve fibers and  if approved  could be complementary to existing drugs used to treat ms 
to our knowledge  there are no current therapies indicated to improve walking ability in people with ms 
on february  the company acquired certain assets of neurorecovery  inc nri 
these assets will enable acorda to explore additional therapeutic indications for its investigational compound fampridine sr  as well as gain access to pre clinical compounds that may have utility in nervous system disorders 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  acorda was assigned two key licensing and research agreements relating to the use of aminopyridines in peripheral neuropathies and two early stage development candidates 
acorda also acquired nri s pre clinical and clinical data  regulatory filings including orphan drug designations  copyrights  trademarks and domain names relating to the three products 
acorda issued  shares of its common stock as the purchase price for these assets which were valued at per share 
the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of in process research and development assets and  as such  resulted in a non cash expense in the first quarter of of we have three preclinical programs focused on novel approaches to repair damaged components of the cns 
we believe all of our preclinical programs neuregulins  remyelinating antibodies and chondroitinase have broad applicability and have the potential to be first in class therapies 
while these programs have initially been focused on ms and sci  we believe they may be applicable across a number of cns disorders  including stroke and traumatic brain injury  because many of the mechanisms of tissue damage and repair are similar 
in addition  we believe 
table of contents that these programs have applicability beyond the nervous system  including in such fields as cardiology  oncology  orthopedics and ophthalmology 
our preclinical programs also target ms and sci  as well as other cns disorders  including stroke and traumatic brain injury 
from until mid  we were engaged almost exclusively in the in licensing of compounds and the preclinical and clinical development of these compounds 
we licensed the rights to fampridine sr from elan for the treatment of sci in in september  we entered into an amended license agreement with elan that granted us exclusive worldwide rights to fampridine sr in return for the payment of royalties and milestones 
in addition  we entered into a supply agreement under which elan provides fampridine sr based upon an agreed upon price schedule 
we have expended a significant portion of our funds on a number of clinical trials for fampridine sr  our most advanced product candidate  including two phase clinical trials of fampridine sr in sci and a phase clinical trial  the results of which were announced in april and the phase clinical trials for ms described above 
an earlier phase clinical trial in ms was completed in in mid  we decided to put our clinical trials of fampridine sr in sci on hold  and refocused our efforts on our ongoing fampridine sr in ms program  leading to our recently completed phase clinical trial of fampridine sr for improvement of walking ability in people with ms 
we may resume our clinical development of fampridine sr for sci in the future 
in july  we acquired all of elan s research  development  distribution  sales and marketing rights to zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets in the united states 
these products are fda approved for the management of spasticity 
we made an upfront payment to elan of million and we will also be obligated to pay royalties upon the achievement of specified sales levels 
through december   we achieved and paid all required milestones totaling million in the aggregate  based on the achievement of specified levels of sales 
as part of our zanaflex acquisition  we entered into a long term supply agreement with elan under which elan provides us with zanaflex capsules 
elan also assigned us its rights under an agreement with novartis for the supply of tizanidine and zanaflex tablets 
our marketing efforts are focused on zanaflex capsules  which we launched in april and pre launch activities associated with the commercialization of fampridine sr  if approved 
zanaflex tablets lost compound patent protection in and both zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets compete with generic tizanidine products 
although we currently distribute zanaflex tablets  we do not  and do not intend to  actively promote zanaflex tablets 
as a result  prescriptions for zanaflex tablets have declined and we expect that they will continue to decline 
our goal is to convert as many sales of zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets to sales of zanaflex capsules as possible 
we believe that sales of zanaflex capsules will constitute a significant portion of our total revenue until we begin to generate sales of fampridine sr if approved 
zanaflex capsules and tablets commercial operations were cash flow positive in and are expected to be cash flow positive in  with zanaflex capsules revenue expected to grow modestly during this period 
in late  we began establishing our own specialty sales force in the us  which consisted of sales professionals as of december  this sales force has targeted neurologists and other prescribers who specialize in treating people with conditions that involve spasticity 
we also employ an internal and field based team who call on managed care organizations  pharmacists and distribution customers 
in addition  we retain tms professional markets group  llc to provide a small  dedicated sales force of pharmaceutical telesales professionals who contact primary care  specialist physicians and pharmacists 

table of contents in december  we entered into a revenue interest assignment agreement with prf pursuant to which we assigned prf the right to receive a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement which definition is different from our net revenues as determined in accordance with gaap from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
the agreement covers all such zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement is terminated earlier 
under the agreement  prf is entitled to a royalty consisting of certain specified percentages of zanaflex net revenues  based upon the level of net revenues 
the agreement provides that the royalty rate will drop to upon prf s receipt of times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  as amended 
under the terms of the agreement  we are required to pay prf million on december  and an additional million on december  for more information regarding our agreement with prf  see liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
we completed our initial public offering in february  in which we sold  shares of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
since then  we have completed a million private placement of our common stock in october and three follow on common stock offerings  raising an aggregate of approximately million  in july and in february and august in september  we received a paragraph iv certification notice from apotex inc advising that it had filed an anda with the fda for generic versions of each of the three zanaflex capsules tizanidine hydrochloride dosage strengths marketed by us 
in response to the filing of the anda  in october  we filed a lawsuit against apotex corp 
and apotex inc collectively  apotex in the united states district court for the district of new jersey asserting infringement of our us patent no 
 relating to multiparticulate tizanidine compositions  including those sold by us as zanaflex capsules 
the patent expires in the defendants have answered our complaint  asserting patent invalidity and non infringement and counterclaiming  seeking a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and non infringement 
we have denied those counterclaims 
if the anda were approved by the fda and apotex were successful in challenging the validity of the patent  apotex could be permitted to sell a generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsule in competition with zanaflex capsules 
in march  apotex filed a motion  which we opposed  for partial judgment on the pleadings dismissing our request for relief on the ground that the case is exceptional under usc e or the court ruled in our favor and denied apotex motion in december we and apotex are currently proceeding with discovery in the case 
product revenue and returns product revenue consists of sales of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets 
under sfas  revenue recognition when the right of return exists  we are not permitted to recognize revenue until we can reasonably estimate the likely return rate for our products 
since we have only limited sales history with zanaflex capsules and due to generic competition and customer conversion from zanaflex tablets to zanaflex capsules  we cannot reasonably determine a return rate 
as a result  we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model 
at a future point in time  we expect to be able to reasonably estimate product returns and will then begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
under our deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the inventory held by the wholesaler as a component of inventory 
we recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to end users because once prescriptions are filled 
table of contents the product cannot be returned 
we use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
when we receive the prescription data  we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales 
we then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold 
we began receiving end user prescription data in march which enabled us to begin recognizing revenue from zanaflex tablet sales 
we began marketing zanaflex capsules in april and began receiving prescription data and recognizing revenue in the same month 
under our revenue interest assignment agreement with prf  as amended in november  prf is entitled to a portion of our net revenues from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
the agreement covers all zanaflex net revenues as defined in the agreement generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement terminates earlier 
under the agreement  prf is entitled to a certain portion of such zanaflex net revenues 
for more information regarding our agreement with prf  see liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
we accept returns of products for six months prior to and months after their expiration date 
returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
discounts and allowances reserves for wholesaler fees for services  cash discounts  medicaid and patient program rebates and chargebacks have been established 
at the time product is shipped to wholesalers a charge is recorded to discounts and allowances and the appropriate reserves are credited 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate of historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
allowances for wholesaler fees for services  chargebacks  rebates and discounts are established based on contractual terms with customers and analyses of historical usage of discount  chargeback and rebate reserves 
grant revenue grant revenue is recognized when the related research expenses are incurred and our performance obligations under the terms of the respective contract are satisfied 
to the extent expended  grant revenue related to the purchase of equipment is deferred and amortized over the shorter of its useful life or the life of the related contract 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of cost of inventory  expense due to inventory reserves  royalty expense  milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with the zanaflex acquisition  packaging costs  freight and required inventory stability testing costs 
our inventory costs  royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into in connection with our zanaflex acquisition 
any payments we make to prf in connection with the revenue interest assignment transaction entered into in december will not constitute royalty expense or otherwise affect our cost of sales

research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of million from  to million for the development of our preclinical pipeline products for a potential ind filing in late for one of these products and the company s acquisition of certain in process research and development assets of nri resulted in a non cash expense of approximately million in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in ms clinical development program expense of million or to million 
this decrease was primarily due to an initial ramp up of our second phase clinical trial of fampridine sr during and the thorough qt cardiac study which was conducted during the second half of operating expenses for clinical development  pre clinical research and development and regulatory were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in regulatory expenses of million for the preparation of an nda for fampridine sr and related consulting fees and an increase in research and development staff and compensation of approximately million to support pre clinical research and development  fampridine sr clinical studies and nda preparation 
other contract expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   an increase of  or

table of contents sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in and primarily due to an increase in our expected pre launch activities and an approximate doubling of the size of our existing sales force in anticipation of the potential launch of fampridine sr  if approved 
other income expense other expense was  in expense for the year ended december  compared to other income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of million 
this increase in interest expense was the result of a million increase in interest expense under the prf revenue interest agreement as a result of increased shipments and the impact of a million out of period adjustment made during the second quarter of to correct an error identified in the previously recorded effective interest expense related to the november amended revenue interests assignment agreement with prf 
this out of period adjustment did not increase the total interest expense associated with this agreement

as part of the zanaflex acquisition in  we agreed to accept any returns of zanaflex tablets that were returned subsequent to january   including returns of product that was originally sold by elan 
product returns prior to that date were the responsibility of elan 
as a result of this agreement  in december we recorded a return liability of million which was our best estimate of the zanaflex tablet returns for which we could potentially become liable 
our obligation to continue to accept these returns ended in june as a result of the returns we accepted since  the net balance remaining on this liability was approximately million in june we reversed this liability in june  which resulted in a reduction in discounts and allowances of million and a corresponding reduction of the product return liability on our balance sheet 
also contributing to the increase in discounts and allowances in versus was the higher level of zanaflex revenues and related shipments

the charges for excess inventory were taken in due to lower than anticipated sales of zanaflex capsules and because zanaflex capsules inventory had month dating at the time 
during the three month period ended june   results from stability testing performed on zanaflex capsules by our manufacturing partner  elan  supported an increase in zanaflex capsules expiration dating from months to months 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires that the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the remaining service period after the adoption date based on the award s original estimate of fair value 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we changed our method of recognizing the number of outstanding instruments for which the requisite service is not expected to be rendered from an actual basis to an estimate 
this change resulted in the recognition of a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the twelve months ending december  of  compared to none for the year ended december  the cumulative effect adjustment represents the difference between compensation cost recognized through the date of adoption using actual forfeitures and the cost that would have been recognized to date using estimated forfeitures 

table of contents beneficial conversion feature  accretion of issuance costs  preferred dividends and fair value of warrants issued to convertible preferred stockholders charges related to preferred stock decreased from million for the twelve month period ended december  to no charge for the twelve month period ended december   due to the recognition of the remaining unamortized portion of beneficial conversion charges and issuance costs and reversal of the cumulative preferred dividend upon the completion of our initial public offering of our common stock in february no further charges are necessary

financing arrangements in january  elan international services  ltd 
eis loaned us an aggregate of million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes to partly fund our research and development activities 
on december   elan transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with saints capital 
as of december   million of these promissory notes were outstanding 
in january  we entered into a million senior secured term loan which was repaid during the three month period ended march  on december   we entered into a revenue interest assignment agreement with prf  a dedicated healthcare investment fund  pursuant to which we assigned to prf the right to a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
to secure our obligations to prf  we also granted prf a security interest in substantially all of our assets related to zanaflex 
our agreement with prf covers all zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement terminates earlier 
in november  we entered into an amendment to the revenue interest assignment agreement with prf 
under the terms of the amendment  prf paid us million in november and an additional million in february since our net revenues during the fiscal year exceeded million 
under the terms of the amendment  we are required to pay prf million on december  and an additional million on december  under the agreement and the amendment  prf is entitled to the following portion of zanaflex net revenues with respect to zanaflex net revenues up to and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million but less than and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  and with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues 

table of contents notwithstanding the foregoing  once prf has received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  prf will only be entitled to of zanaflex net revenues 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a liability as of december   referred to as the revenue interest liability  of approximately million in accordance with eitf  sales of future revenues 
we impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method and record a corresponding accrued interest liability 
the effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the life of the arrangement 
the interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors  including the level of zanaflex sales 
we currently estimate that the imputed interest rate associated with this liability will be approximately 
payments made to prf as a result of zanaflex sales levels will reduce the accrued interest liability and the principal amount of the revenue interest liability 
upon the occurrence of certain events  including if we experience a change of control  undergo certain bankruptcy events  transfer any of our interests in zanaflex other than pursuant to a license agreement  development  commercialization  co promotion  collaboration  partnering or similar agreement  transfer all or substantially all of our assets  or breach certain of the covenants  representations or warranties we make under the agreement  prf may i require us to repurchase the rights we sold them at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised or ii foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf 
except in the case of certain bankruptcy events  if prf exercises its right  which we refer to as prf s put option  to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it  prf may not foreclose unless we fail to pay the put call price as required 
if we experience a change of control we have the right  which we refer to as our call option  to repurchase the rights we sold to prf at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised 
the put call price on a given date is the greater of i all payments made by prf to us as of such date  less all payments received by prf from us as of such date  and ii an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to prf of on all payments made by prf to us as of such date  taking into account the amount and timing of all payments received by prf from us as of such date 
we have determined that prf s put option and our call option meet the criteria to be considered an embedded derivative and should be accounted for as such 
therefore  we recorded a net liability of  as of december  related to the put call option to reflect its current estimated fair value  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
this liability is revalued on a semi annual basis to reflect any changes in the fair value and any gain or loss resulting from the revaluation is recorded in earnings 
during any period during which prf has the right to receive of zanaflex net revenues as defined in the agreement  then of the first million in payments from zanaflex sales we receive from wholesalers will be distributed to prf on a daily basis 
following the end of each fiscal quarter  if the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter exceeds the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive  prf will remit such excess to us 
if the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive during such quarter exceeds the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter  we will remit such excess to prf 
investment activities at december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million  as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in a treasury money market fund and high quality government bonds 
also  we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  as compared to

future capital needs our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of revenue generated from sales of zanaflex capsules  revenue from fampridine sr  if approved  the continued progress of our research and development activities  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the amount and timing of milestone or other payments made under collaborative agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the acquisition of licenses to new products or compounds 
we expect to incur losses from operations for at least the next several years as we continue to support our sales and marketing infrastructure for the commercialization of zanaflex capsules  increase our efforts to support pre launch activities for 
table of contents fampridine sr and its commercialization  if approved  and continue our clinical development and advance our preclinical programs 
we believe our year end cash  cash equivalents and investment balances will be in excess of million and that our current financial resources and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and meet financial obligations through based on our current projected revenue and spending levels 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future operating requirements we will need to raise additional capital  reduce planned expenditures  or incur indebtedness to fund its operations 
we may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our sales and marketing efforts  delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our research and development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
contractual obligations and commitments in january  eis loaned us an aggregate of million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes 
one promissory note in the principal amount of million bears interest at a rate of which began on the first anniversary of the note 
the other promissory note in the amount of million was non interest bearing 
on december   eis transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with saints capital 
in december  saints capital exercised the conversion option of the million convertible promissory note at an exercise price of per share and received  shares of common stock 
the remaining million convertible promissory note is convertible into  shares of common stock 
principal and interest are repayable  if not converted  ratably over a seven year period  beginning one year after we receive regulatory approval for certain products to be developed  subject to limitations related to gross margin on product sales 
if we and saints capital determine that regulatory approval will not likely occur  the million promissory note will automatically convert into the underlying common stock unless saints capital elects to have the amount due on the note cancelled 
if our license and supply agreements with elan are terminated for any other reason  the principal and interest is repayable ratably over years 
the million promissory note restricts our ability to incur indebtedness that is senior to the note  subject to certain exceptions  including for our revenue interest assignment arrangement with prf 
in july  we acquired all of elan s research and development  distribution  and sales and marketing rights to zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets in the united states 
under our zanaflex purchase agreement with elan  we were obligated to make milestone payments to elan of up to million based on cumulative gross sales of zanaflex tablets and zanaflex capsules 
as of december   we have made all of these milestone payments 
the final million milestone was reached in january and was paid in the three month period ended june  under our zanaflex supply agreement with elan  we are required to provide to elan an month rolling forecast at the beginning of each month and a two year forecast not later than july of each year 
we are required to order of the forecast required quantities for each five month period immediately following each monthly forecast report 
at december   the forecast requirement for the five month period following december  amounted to approximately million 
under our fampridine sr license agreement with elan  we are obligated to make milestone payments to elan of up to million over the life of the contract and royalty payments as a percentage of product sales 
in addition  under our various other research  license and collaboration agreements with other parties we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of approximately million over the life of the contracts 
the first milestone 
table of contents payment is due to elan days following the fda s approval of a nda for fampridine sr s use for the first indication and further milestone amounts are payable in connection with additional indications 
in december  we entered into a revenue interest assignment agreement with prf pursuant to which we assigned prf the right to receive a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement which definition is different from our net revenues as determined in accordance with gaap from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
the agreement covers all such zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement is terminated earlier 
in consideration for the assignment  prf paid us million at signing 
under our agreement with prf  we are required to use the remainder of the amount we received at signing and any other amounts we receive under the agreement to support commercialization  sales  marketing  clinical and regulatory activities and other financial obligations related specifically and solely to our zanaflex operations 
in november  we entered into an amendment to the revenue interest assignment agreement with prf 
under the amendment  prf is entitled to a royalty consisting of certain specified percentages of zanaflex net revenues  based upon the level of net revenues 
previously  once prf had received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least twice the aggregate amount prf paid us under the agreement  the royalty rate would drop to of zanaflex net revenues 
the amendment provides that the royalty rate will drop to upon prf s receipt of times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  as amended 
under the terms of the amendment  prf paid us million in november and agreed that we would be entitled to an additional million is due if our net revenues during the fiscal year equaled or exceeded million 
this milestone was met and the receivable was reflected in our december  financial statements 
this milestone payment was received in february under the terms of the amendment  we are required to pay prf million on december  and an additional million on december  the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of december  this table does not include certain contingent payments as to which we cannot reasonably determine amount and timing and does not include the million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes payable to saints capital or milestone payments under our license agreements as these amounts are payable on contingent events 
this table should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements payments due by period total less than year years years prf payments accrued interest on convertible notes payable operating lease inventory purchase commitment total prf payments represent the two million payments due to prf on december  and december  and exclude principal and interest payments  due to uncertainty as to the amount and timing of such payments 
represents accrued interest on the convertible note on the assumption that it remains outstanding during these periods 
the table does not reflect the repayment of principal  due to the contingent nature of any such repayment and the timing thereof

effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  primarily employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of critical accounting policies identifies the accounting policies that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting 
table of contents principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our areas of critical accounting policies sales revenue recognition  research and development  income taxes  and share based compensation 
revenue recognition we apply the revenue recognition guidance in sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  which among other criteria requires that future returns can be reasonably estimated in order to recognize revenue 
under sfas we are not permitted to recognize revenue until we can reasonably estimate the likely return rate for our products 
since we have only limited sales history with zanaflex capsules and due to generic competition and customer conversion from zanaflex tablets to zanaflex capsules  we do not believe we can reasonably determine a return rate 
as a result  we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model 
at a future point in time  which could be in a number of years  when we are able to reasonably estimate product returns we will begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
under our deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the inventory shipped as inventory held by others 
we recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to an end user because once a prescription is filled the product cannot be returned 
we use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales 
we then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold 
we began receiving end user prescription data in march which enabled us to begin recognizing revenue from zanaflex tablet sales 
we began marketing zanaflex capsules in april and began receiving prescription data and recognizing revenue in the same month 
in addition to the prescription data we purchase  we also receive data that we use to monitor trends in sales from wholesalers to their customers 
we receive this data from an outside vendor on a monthly basis 
this data includes the number of bottles shipped from certain wholesalers to their customers 
we also compare our shipments to wholesalers to prescription reports to further assess inventory in the distribution channel on a monthly basis 
we use the wholesaler sales trend data and the wholesaler vs 
prescription comparison to better understand market conditions  but not as a basis for recognizing revenue 
we accept returns of products for six months prior to and months after their expiration date 
returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities including  salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  and research and development conducted for us by third parties  such as sponsored university based research  clinical trial vendors  contract manufacturing for our preclinical program  and regulatory consulting to support our nda filing 
in addition  research and development expenses include expenses related to grant revenue and the cost of clinical trial drug supply shipped to our clinical study vendors 
we account for our clinical study costs by estimating the patient cost per visit in each clinical trial and recognizing this cost as visits occur  beginning when the patient enrolls in the trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial 
cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  
table of contents the site of the clinical trial  and the length of the treatment period for each patient 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accrual  such changes in estimate may be a material change in our clinical study accrual  which could also materially affect our results of operations 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred except where eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities applies 
in these cases  non refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are capitalized at the time of payment and expensed when the research and development activity has been performed 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the years ended december  and we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our gross deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot be sufficiently assured at december  as of december   we had available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income  if any  and expire between and and research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes  if any  through since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and expect to incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  the code  provides for a limitation of the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the code that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carry forwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the code  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
share based compensation we account for stock options and restricted stock granted to employees according to the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date of january  we estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the black scholes closed form option pricing model based on assumptions for the expected term of the stock options  expected volatility of our common stock  prevailing interest rates  and an estimated forfeiture rate 

table of contents we have based our current assumptions on the following assumption method of estimating estimated expected term of options based on the th percentile of our peer companies expected volatility combination of historic volatility of our common stock since october  and the historic volatility of the stock of our peer companies risk free interest rate yields of us treasury securities corresponding with the expected life of option grants forfeiture rates historical forfeiture data of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of the employees and expected performance of our common stock 
increases in the term and the volatility of our common stock will generally cause an increase in compensation expense 
we account for stock options granted to non employees on a fair value basis in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinion no 
and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  grants receivable  notes payable  convertible notes payable  accounts payable  and put call liability 
the estimated fair values of all of our financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts at december  we have cash equivalents and short term investments at december   which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as our interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds  us treasury bonds and corporate debt securities  the carrying value of our cash equivalents and short term investments approximate their fair value at december  we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments
