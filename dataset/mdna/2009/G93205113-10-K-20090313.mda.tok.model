please refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
our industry the offshore contract drilling industry provides drilling  workover and well construction services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies through the use of mobile offshore drilling rigs 
the customers are primarily large multinational oil and natural gas companies  government owned oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas producers 
historically  the offshore drilling industry has been very cyclical with periods of high demand  limited rig supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates 
periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in some rigs becoming idle for long periods of time 
as is common throughout the oilfield services industry  offshore contract drilling is largely driven by actual or anticipated changes in oil and natural gas prices and capital spending by companies exploring for and producing oil and natural gas 
sustained high commodity prices historically have led to increases in expenditures for offshore drilling activities and  as a result  greater demand for our services 
the recent volatility in the financial markets has led to a global decline in economic activity and increased the uncertainty of the future economic outlook 
the decline in economic activity has resulted in a worldwide decrease in demand for oil and natural gas and a steep decline in commodity prices which has caused many oil and gas companies to curtail planned capital spending 
given the volatility in the financial markets and general economic uncertainty  it is difficult to predict to what extent these events will affect our business in and our ability to grow and implement our strategy drilling fleet the following table sets forth certain information concerning our offshore fleet at march  name ownership make year built water depth rating feet drilling depth capacity feet location status independent leg cantilevered jackups emerald driller baker marine pacific class thailand operating sapphire driller baker marine pacific class singapore construction aquamarine driller baker marine pacific class singapore construction topaz driller baker marine pacific class singapore construction dynamically positioned drillships platinum explorer dsme proprietary design korea construction contracted titanium explorer dsme proprietary design korea construction contracted cobalt explorer dsme proprietary design korea construction semisubmersibles oban b moss maritime cs mkii in transit construction contracted sdo ii moss maritime cs mkii in transit construction owner has the option to extend vantage s management services agreement to this semisubmersible 
we anticipate that owner will exercise this option 
we have commenced marketing this rig to potential customers 

table of contents jackups a jackup rig is a mobile  self elevating drilling platform equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established for support and then the hull is raised out of the water into position to conduct drilling and workover operations 
the rig hull includes the drilling rig  jacking system  crew quarters  loading and unloading facilities  storage areas for bulk and liquid materials  helicopter deck  and other operating equipment 
the cantilever feature allows the drilling platform to be extended out from the hull  permitting the rig to perform drilling and workover operations over pre existing platforms and structures 
the baker marine pacific class ultra premium jackup rig is a proprietary design developed as an independent leg  cantilever  non harsh environment jackup rig 
these rigs have a drilling depth of approximately  feet and may operate in water depths up to feet  depending on ocean and ocean floor conditions 
drillships drillships are self propelled and can be positioned over a well site through the use of a computer controlled dynamic positioning thruster system 
the drillships are suited for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load carrying capacity 
the drillships that we will operate are being constructed by daewoo shipbuilding marine engineering co 
ltd 
dsme and are designed for drilling in water depths of up to  feet  with a total vertical drilling depth of up to  feet 
the drillships hull design has a variable deck load of around  tons and measuring feet long by feet wide 
semisubmersibles semisubmersibles are floating vessels that can be submerged by means of a water ballast system such that the lower hulls are below the water surface during drilling operations 
these rigs are capable of maintaining their position over the well through the use of a computer controlled dynamic positioning thruster system 
the semisubmersible that we will operate is designed to operate in water depths up to  feet  with total vertical drilling depth of up to  feet 
the semisubmersible is designed to be capable of drilling in harsh environmental conditions 
markets offshore drilling rigs are generally marketed on a worldwide basis as rigs can be moved from one region to another 
the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary between regions 
however  significant variations between regions do not tend to exist long term because of rig mobility 
the offshore drilling market generally consists of shallow water ft  midwater ft  deepwater  ft 
and ultra deepwater  ft the global shallow water market is serviced primarily by jackups 
there are approximately marketed jackups in the world  which vary by leg length and configuration 
our jackup fleet is focused on the long legged ft high specification market 
the drillships and semisubmersibles that we operate and have agreements to operate are focused on the deepwater and ultra deepwater segments which have been very strong in recent years as demand for deepwater and ultra deepwater rigs has exceeded supply 
drilling contracts the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with contracts traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
the rigs technical capabilities  availability  age and pricing are often the primary factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
other key factors include a contractor s reputation for service  safety record  environmental record  technical and engineering support and long term relationships with national and international oil companies 

table of contents oil and natural gas well drilling contracts are carried out on a dayrate  footage or turnkey basis 
under dayrate contracts  we charge the customer a fixed amount per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well 
in addition  dayrate contracts usually provide for a reduced dayrate  or lump a sum amount for mobilizing the rig to the well location  or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control 
a dayrate drilling contract generally covers either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or has a stated term 
these contracts may generally be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is damaged  destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party 
in addition  drilling contracts with certain customers may be cancelable  without cause  with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination payments 
in some instances  the dayrate contract term may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time at fixed or mutually agreed terms  including dayrates 
we anticipate that we will contract our services on a dayrate basis 
however  market conditions may require us to enter into other contracts that provide for payment on a footage basis  whereby we will be paid a fixed amount for each foot drilled regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well  or enter into turnkey contracts  whereby we agree to drill a well to a specific depth for a fixed price and to bear some of the well equipment costs 
compared with dayrate contracts  footage and turnkey contracts involve a higher degree of risk 
a customer is more likely to seek to cancel or renegotiate its contract during periods of depressed market conditions 
we could be required to pay penalties if our contracts with our customers are canceled due to excessive downtime or operational problems 
suspension of drilling contracts results in the reduction in or loss of dayrates for the period of the suspension 
if our customers cancel some of our significant contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on substantially similar terms  or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time  it could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 
competition the contract drilling industry is highly competitive 
demand for contract drilling and related services is influenced by a number of factors  including the current and expected prices of oil and natural gas and the expenditures of oil and natural gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas 
in addition  demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond our control  including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production of non opec countries and the policies of the various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis 
pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
rig availability  capabilities  age and each contractor s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination 
operators also may consider crew experience  rig location and efficiency 
we believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly competitive for the foreseeable future 
certain competitors may have greater financial resources than we do  which may better enable them to withstand periods of low utilization  compete more effectively on the basis of price  build new rigs or acquire existing rigs 
our competition ranges from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller  locally owned companies 
competition for offshore rigs is usually on a global basis  as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved  at a cost that is sometimes substantial  from one region to another in response to demand 
insurance the contract drilling industry is subject to hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and natural gas wells  including blowouts and well fires  which could cause personal injury  suspend drilling operations  or seriously damage or destroy the equipment involved 
offshore drilling operations are also subject to hazards particular to marine operations including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
we anticipate obtaining insurance policies covering certain exposures  including physical damage to our drilling rigs and personal injury claims by our drilling crews  loss of hire insurance  insurance for cargo  control of well  auto liability  non owned aviation and similar potential liabilities 
we cannot make any assurances that such insurance will be available or available on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents restructure agreement on november   vantage deepwater company  a cayman islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of the company deepwater  and f capital  a cayman islands exempted company that is wholly owned by hsin chi su  a director of the company  entered into a share sale and purchase agreement the restructure agreement relating to mandarin drilling company  a marshall islands corporation  mandarin that currently owns the construction contract for the platinum explorer 
pursuant to the terms of the restructure agreement  deepwater will purchase from f capital in a series of closings an aggregate of  ordinary shares of mandarin constituting of the outstanding shares of mandarin in consideration for payments in the aggregate of million  of which million had previously been paid  and the issuance by the company of warrants to purchase up to million of its ordinary shares  par value

environmental regulation for a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation  see item a 
risk factors vantage drilling is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations  including those that may impose significant costs and liability on it for environmental and natural resource damages 
as our operations increase  we anticipate that we will make expenditures to comply with environmental requirements 
to date  we have not expended material amounts in order to comply and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or competitive position or materially increase our capital expenditures

risk factors in evaluating our business  you should consider carefully the following risk factors in addition to the other information presented in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only risks that we face 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our securities may decline 
risks related to our business our business is difficult to evaluate due to a lack of operational history 
our predecessor  vantage energy  was formed in september and consummated an initial public offering in may vantage energy was a special purpose acquisition company with a limited operational history which consisted of certain financial transactions and the evaluation of potential acquisitions including the acquisition of ogil 
vantage was formed in primarily for the purpose of merging vantage energy with ogil 
the operations of ogil have been limited to the assumption of the construction contracts for the four baker marine pacific class ultra premium jackup drilling rigs  the first of which was placed into service in february because we have a limited operating history  you may not be able to evaluate our future prospects accurately  which will be dependent on our ability to successfully complete the construction of the jackups  semisubmersibles and drillships  obtain customer contracts and operate the jackups  semisubmersibles and drillships 
a material or extended decline in expenditures by oil and gas exploration and production companies  due to a decline or volatility in oil and natural gas prices  a decrease in demand for oil and natural gas or other factors  would adversely affect our business 
our business depends on the level of activity in oil and natural gas exploration  development and production expenditures of our customers 
oil and natural gas prices and our customers expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity 
commodity prices are affected by numerous factors  including the following changes in the global economic conditions  including the potential for a recession  the demand for oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and natural gas  expectations regarding future prices  advances in exploration  development and production technology  the ability of opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the availability and discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves  the level of production in non opec countries  domestic and international tax policies  the development and exploitation of alternative fuels  the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves  and the worldwide military and political environment  uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in significant oil and natural gas producing regions or further acts of terrorism 
oil and natural gas prices have been at historically high levels until experiencing a sharp decline during the second half of this decline in commodity prices has caused companies exploring for and producing oil and natural gas to cancel or curtail their drilling programs  or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons  including their lack of success in exploration efforts 
any reduction in the demand for drilling services may materially erode dayrates and utilization rates for drilling rigs  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and could have a significant negative impact on the market price of our securities 

table of contents our business is affected by local  national and worldwide economic conditions and the condition of the oil and gas industry 
recent economic data indicates the rate of economic growth worldwide has declined significantly from the growth rates experienced in recent years 
the consequences of a recession may include a lower level of economic activity  uncertainty regarding energy and commodity prices and reduced demand for oil and natural gas 
in addition  current economic conditions may cause many oil and natural gas production companies to reduce or delay expenditures to reduce costs  which in turn may cause a reduction in the demand for our services 
if the recession is prolonged or worsens  our business and financial condition may be adversely impacted and we could become more vulnerable to further adverse general economic and industry conditions 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  access to capital and cost of capital 
during the second half of and continuing in  the financial markets experienced extreme volatility 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets may limit our access to capital 
in december  we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement that made a portion of the facility subject to syndication to other financial institutions 
if we are not able to successfully syndicate those portions of our facility we will need to seek additional financing in order to complete our jackup rig construction program 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors including market and general economic conditions  the availability of capital  and the possibility that investors could develop a negative perception of our long or short term projects 
if we are not able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our industry is highly competitive  cyclical and subject to intense price competition 
due to our lack of operating history  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors 
the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with contracts traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis 
the rigs technical capabilities  availability and pricing are often the primary factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
other key factors include a contractor s reputation for service  safety record  environmental record  technical and engineering support and long term relationships with national and international oil companies 
our competitors in the offshore contract drilling industry generally have larger  more diverse fleets  longer operating histories that have established safety and environmental records over a measurable period of time  experienced in house technical and engineering support departments and long term relationships with customers 
this provides our competitors with competitive advantages that may adversely affect our efforts to contract the rigs on favorable terms  if at all  and correspondingly negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
the offshore contract drilling industry  historically  has been very cyclical with periods of high demand  limited rig supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates 
periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify competition in the industry and often result in some rigs becoming idle for long periods of time 
our lack of operating history may put us at a competitive disadvantage and result in our rigs being idle 
prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates  or extended idle time  could result in the recognition of impairment charges on our rigs if cash flow estimates  based upon information available to management at the time  indicate that the carrying value of the rigs may not be recoverable 
our business involves numerous operating hazards  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses 
our operations will be subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling and operation of oil and natural gas wells  such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  punchthroughs  craterings  fires and pollution 
the occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling or production operations  claims by the operator  severe damage to or destruction of the property and equipment involved  injury or death to rig personnel  and environmental damage 
we may also be subject to personal injury and other claims of rig or drillship personnel as a result of our drilling operations 
operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns  abnormal operating conditions  failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services and personnel shortages 
in addition  our operations will be subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our rigs could be damaged by high winds  turbulent seas  or unstable sea bottom conditions which could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until the damages are repaired 

table of contents damage to the environment could result from our operations  particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires 
we may also be subject to property  environmental and other damage claims by oil and natural gas companies and other businesses operating offshore and in coastal areas 
insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses  and we may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks 
moreover  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event resulting in damage to our rigs  including severe weather  terrorist acts  war  civil disturbances  pollution or environmental damage  occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a customer  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us 
consistent with standard industry practice  clients generally assume  and indemnify against  well control and subsurface risks under dayrate contracts 
these risks are those associated with the loss of control of a well  such as blowout or cratering  the cost to regain control or redrill the well and associated pollution 
we may not be able to obtain agreement from customers to indemnify us for such damages and risks 
additionally  even if clients agree to indemnify us  there can be no assurance  however  that clients will necessarily be financially able to indemnify us against all these risks 
failure to obtain deliveries of the jackup rigs may have a material and adverse effect on vantage 
at this time only one of the rigs is operational 
the other jackup rigs may not be completed  delivered to us or acceptable to our clients 
we may not be able to secure any drilling contracts for the rigs now or in the future 
any failure to obtain drilling contracts for any or all of the rigs may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and viability as a business 
there may be limits to our ability to mobilize rigs between geographic markets and the time and costs of such rig mobilizations may be material to its business 
the offshore contract drilling market is generally a global market as rigs may be mobilized from one market to another market 
however  geographic markets can  from time to time  have material fluctuations as the ability to mobilize rigs can be impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  governmental regulation and customs practices  the significant costs to move a rig  availability of tow boats  weather  and the technical capability of the rigs to operate in various environments 
additionally  while a rig is being mobilized from one geographic market to another  we may not be paid by our client for the time out of service or may mobilize the rig without a customer contract which will result in a lack of revenues that may be material to its results of operations and financial position 
operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
we do not expect operating and maintenance costs to necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
operating revenues may fluctuate as a function of changes in dayrate 
however  costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only semi variable regardless of the dayrate being earned 
in addition  should the rigs incur idle time between contracts  we would typically maintain the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract and would not reduce costs to correspond to the decrease in revenue 
during times of moderate activity  reductions in costs may not be immediate as the crew may be required to prepare the rigs for stacking  after which time the crew will be reduced to a level necessary to maintain the rig in working condition with the extra crew members assigned to active rigs or dismissed 
in addition  as rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another  the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly 
equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment 
contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized 
our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations  including those that may impose significant costs and liability on it for environmental and natural resource damages 
many aspects of our operations are affected by governmental laws and regulations that may relate directly or indirectly to the contract drilling and well servicing industries  including those requiring us to control the discharge of oil and other contaminants into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
our operations and activities in the united states will be subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  including the oil pollution act of  the outer continental shelf lands act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships 
additionally  other countries where we operate have environmental laws and regulations covering the discharge of oil and other contaminants and protection of the environment in connection with operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and even criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions that may limit or prohibit our operations 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability  rendering us liable for environmental and natural resource damages without regard to negligence or fault on our part 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
the application of these requirements  the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or development drilling for oil and natural gas could materially limit future contract drilling opportunities or materially increase our costs or both 
in addition  we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with laws and regulations or materially increase our costs or both 

table of contents any ban of offshore drilling by any city  state  or nation  or by any governing body may have a material and adverse affect on our business 
events in recent years have heightened environmental and regulatory concerns about the oil and gas industry 
from time to time  governing bodies may propose legislation that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas 
to date  no proposals which would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in our expected areas of operation have been enacted into law 
however  governing bodies may enact such laws now or in the future 
if laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restrict or prohibit offshore drilling in our expected areas of operation we could be materially and adversely affected 
changes in laws  effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our financial results 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws  both domestically and internationally 
tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation 
consequently  we are subject to changing tax laws  treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate 
our income tax expense is based upon its interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred 
a change in these tax laws  treaties or regulations or in the interpretation thereof  could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings 
if any country successfully challenges our income tax filings based on our operational structure there  or if we otherwise lose a material dispute  our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our financial results could be materially adversely affected 
new technology and or products may cause our jackup rigs to become less competitive 
the offshore contract drilling industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling techniques and services using new technologies  some of which may be subject to patent protection 
as competitors and others use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage 
further  we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost 
most of our competitors have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that will allow them to enjoy technological advantages and implement new technologies before we can 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technology or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
thus  our ability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technology may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate if a catastrophic event occurs 
as a result of the number of catastrophic events in the contract offshore industry in recent years  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  insurance underwriters have increased insurance premiums and increased restrictions on coverage and have made other coverages unavailable 
while we will attempt to obtain  and believe we can obtain  reasonable policy limits of property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance  including coverage for acts of terrorism  with financially sound insurers  we cannot guarantee that our policy limits for property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance  including coverage for acts of terrorism  would be adequate should a catastrophic event occur related to our property  plant  equipment  or product  or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay related claims or damages 
when any of our coverage expires  we cannot guarantee that adequate replacement coverage will be available  offered at reasonable costs  or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness 
the occurrence of an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of the rigs could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and or company liability was to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer was unable to sufficiently or fully pay related claims or damages which may significantly impair our ability to obtain such insurance coverage in the future 

table of contents we will incur substantial amounts of debt that may limit the cash flow available for its operations and place it at a competitive disadvantage 
we will incur a substantial amount of debt to fund the construction of the jackup rigs 
our level of indebtedness has important consequences to you and your investment in our securities 
for example  our level of indebtedness may require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt  which would reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other investments  which may limit our ability to carry out our business strategy  result in higher interest expense if interest rates increase and we have outstanding floating rate borrowings  or heighten our vulnerability to downturns in business or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions 
each of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and viability 
our international operations are subject to additional political  economic  and other uncertainties not generally associated with domestic operations 
the primary component of our business strategy is to operate in international oil and natural gas producing areas 
our international operations will be subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries  including political  social and economic instability  war and acts of terrorism  potential seizure  expropriation or nationalization of assets  damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees  including kidnappings  piracy  increased operating costs  complications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations  repudiation  modification or renegotiation of contracts  limitations on insurance coverage  such as war risk coverage in certain areas  import export quotas  confiscatory taxation  work stoppages  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  wage and price controls  imposition of trade barriers  imposition or changes in enforcement of local content laws  restrictions on currency or capital repatriations  currency fluctuations and devaluations  and other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control 
our financial condition and results of operations could be susceptible to adverse events beyond our control that may occur in the particular country or region in which we are active 
additionally  we may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not hedge an exposure to a foreign currency 
we may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation  controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital 
many governments favor or effectively require that drilling contracts be awarded to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these practices may result in inefficiencies or put us at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts against local competitors 

table of contents our contract drilling operations will be subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to the equipment and operation of drilling units  currency conversions and repatriation  oil and natural gas exploration and development  taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of units and other equipment 
governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions  the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries 
in some areas of the world  this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so 
operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems which are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries  which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings 
construction projects are subject to risks  including delays and cost overruns  which could have an adverse impact on our available cash resources and results of operations 
as part of our growth strategy we will contract from time to time for the construction of rigs and drillships 
we currently have contracts for the construction of three jackup rigs 
additionally  we will oversee and manage the construction of three ultra deepwater drillships and one ultra deepwater semisubmersible for third parties 
our rig construction projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project  including costs or delays resulting from the following unexpectedly long delivery times for  or shortages of  key equipment  parts and materials  shortages of skilled labor and other shipyard personnel necessary to perform the work  unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment  labor and raw materials  particularly steel  unforeseen design and engineering problems  unanticipated actual or purported change orders  work stoppages  latent damages or deterioration to hull  equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions  failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes  disputes with shipyards and suppliers  delays and unexpected costs of incorporating parts and materials needed for the completion of projects  financial or other difficulties at shipyards  adverse weather conditions  and inability to obtain required permits or approvals 
we may experience delays and costs overruns in the construction of these rigs due to certain of the factors listed above 
any delays could put at risk our planned arrangements to commence operations on schedule and subject us to penalties for such failure 
significant cost overruns or delays would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  capital expenditures for these projects could exceed our planned capital expenditures 
failure to complete a construction project on time may  in some circumstances  result in the delay  renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract 
our financial condition may be adversely effected if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions  fail to successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses we acquire  or are unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms 
the acquisition of assets or businesses that we believe to be complementary to our drilling operations is an important component of our business strategy 
we believe that acquisition opportunities may arise from time to time  and any such acquisition could be significant 
at any given time  discussions with one or more potential sellers may be at different stages 
however  any such discussions may not result in the consummation of an acquisition transaction  and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisitions 
any such transactions could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash  the incurrence of a substantial amount of debt or the issuance of a substantial amount of equity 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of our securities 
any future acquisitions could present a number of risks  including the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations  
table of contents the risk of failing to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely  and the risk of diversion of management s attention from existing operations or other priorities 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain  on terms we find acceptable  sufficient financing that may be required for any such acquisition or investment 
if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other operations or assets  our financial condition could be adversely affected and we may be unable to implement an important component of our business strategy successfully 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in integrating our acquisitions in a timely and cost effective manner  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
failure to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers or an increase in labor costs could hurt our operations 
we will require skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services to and support for our rigs and drillships 
in periods of increasing activity and when the number of operating units in our areas of operation increases  either because of new construction  re activation of idle units or the mobilization of units into the region  shortages of qualified personnel could arise  creating upward pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing 
the shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel also could negatively affect the quality and timeliness of our work 
in addition  our ability to expand our operations depends in part upon our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force 
compliance with or a breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations 
our operations will be subject to regulations that require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or other governmental approvals  control the discharge of materials into the environment  require the removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may in some cases impose strict liability  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
some of these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
the application of these requirements  the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some actions 
our credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit our ability to make investments and other restricted payments  including dividends  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  create or incur liens  receive dividend or other payments from our subsidiaries to us  sell our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions 
our credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum working capital ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio and net debt to capitalization ratio 
our compliance with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions  take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable  obtain future financing  fund needed capital expenditures  finance our acquisitions  equipment purchases and development expenditures  or withstand a future downturn in our business 
if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness or in current or future debt financing agreements  there could be a default under the terms of these agreements which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that we have borrowed 
our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants  including meeting financial ratios and tests  may be affected by events beyond our control 
if a default occurs under these agreements  lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the outstanding loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions may also be accelerated and become due and payable 
if any of these events occur  our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness  and we may be unable to find alternative financing 
even if we could obtain alternative financing  that financing might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable 
if we were unable to repay amounts borrowed  the holders of the debt could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding against collateral 

table of contents market conditions may dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage or turnkey basis  rather than on a dayrate basis  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and result of operations 
during cyclical periods of depressed market conditions  a customer may no longer need a rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a lower daily rate 
as a result  our potential customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their existing drilling contracts or avoid their obligations under those contracts 
in addition  the customers may have the right to terminate  or may seek to renegotiate  existing contracts if we experience downtime  operational problems above the contractual limit or safety related issues  if the rig is a total loss or in other specified circumstances 
some of our contracts may include terms allowing them to terminate contracts without cause  with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination payments 
in addition  we could be required to pay penalties  which could be material  if some of our contracts with our customers are terminated due to downtime or operational problems 
we may enter into contracts that are cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of a penalty  which may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract 
early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time 
the likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness 
while we intend to perform our services on a dayrate basis  market conditions may dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage basis  whereby we are paid a fixed amount for each foot drilled regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well  or enter into turnkey contracts  whereby it agrees to drill a well to a specific depth for a fixed price and bear some of the well equipment costs 
these types of contracts are more risky than a dayrate contract as the company would be subject to downhole geologic conditions in the well that cannot always be accurately determined and subject it to greater risk associated with equipment and downhole tool failures 
unfavorable downhole geologic conditions and equipment and downhole tool failures may result in significant costs increase or may result in a decision to abandon a well project which would result in the company not being able to invoice revenues for providing services 
such unfavorable costs increases or loss of revenue could have a material adverse impact on its financial position and result of operations 
dependence on key personnel the loss of some key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 
our future operations performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of management as well as marketing  sales and operations personnel 
the loss of one or more of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and further motivate highly skilled management  marketing  sales and operations personnel 
we have experienced intense competition for personnel  and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 
sox compliance while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place  we are still exposed to potential risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have evaluated our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we have performed the system and process evaluation and testing required complying with the management certification requirements of  and preparing for the auditor attestation under  section as a result  we incurred additional expenses and a diversion of management s time 
while we have been able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion  we cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting will be adequate in the future to ensure compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
if we are not able to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting  we might be susceptible to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the securities and exchange commission 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our ordinary shares 
the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets has lead to an extended worldwide economic recession 
a slowdown in economic activity caused by a recession has reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
benchmark crude prices peaked at over per barrel in july and then declined dramatically to approximately per barrel at yearend 
during  the benchmark for crude prices has fluctuated between the mid s per barrel and mid s per barrel 
demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices 
demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development  and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies  including national oil companies 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the immediate levels of exploration  development  and production activity 
perceptions of longer term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects 
lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
additionally  these factors may adversely impact our financial position if they are determined to cause an impairment of our long lived assets 
the global financial crisis may impact our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the continued credit crisis and related instability in the global financial system has had  and may continue to have  an impact on our business and our financial condition 
we may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve 
our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access such markets  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the credit crisis could have an impact on the lenders participating in our credit facilities or on our customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 

table of contents risks related to ordinary shares ownership of our ordinary shares by f capital because hsin chi su  through his ownership of f capital  will continue to hold a significant interest in us  the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions will be limited 
as of march   f capital owns approximately of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares 
upon completion of the restructuring agreement for the platinum explorer and assuming conversion of outstanding loans  f capital will own approximately of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares 
through his ownership of f capital  hsin chi su  one of our directors  will have significant influence over matters such as the election of our directors  control over business  policies and affairs  and other matters submitted to our shareholders 
additional sales of our ordinary shares or warrants by f capital or our employees or issuances by us in connection with future acquisitions or otherwise could cause the price of our securities to decline 
if f capital sells a substantial number of our ordinary shares in the future  the market price of our ordinary shares could decline 
the perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect 
furthermore  if we were to include ordinary shares in a registration statement initiated by us  those additional shares could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our ordinary shares 
one component of our business strategy is to make acquisitions 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue additional ordinary shares  which would have the effect of diluting your percentage ownership of the ordinary shares and could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 
we have no plans to pay regular dividends on our ordinary shares  so investors in our ordinary shares may not receive funds without selling their shares 
we do not intend to declare or pay regular dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future 
instead  we generally intend to invest any future earnings in our business 
subject to cayman islands law  our board of directors will determine the payment of future dividends on our ordinary shares  if any  and the amount of any dividends in light of any applicable contractual restrictions limiting our ability to pay dividends  our earnings and cash flows  our capital requirements  our financial condition  and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends or other distributions on our equity securities 
accordingly  shareholders may have to sell some or all of their ordinary shares in order to generate cash flow from their investment 
shareholders may not receive a gain on their investment when they sell our ordinary shares and may lose the entire amount of their investment 
because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands  you may face difficulties in protecting your interests  and your ability to protect your rights through the us federal courts may be limited 
we are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands  and substantially all of our assets will be located outside the united states 
in addition  most of our directors and executive officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the united states and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon our directors or executive officers  or enforce judgments obtained in the united states courts against our directors or executive officers 
our corporate affairs will be governed by our memorandum and articles of association  the companies law revision as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time the companies law and the common law of the cayman islands 
the rights of shareholders to take action against the directors  actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under cayman islands law are  to a large extent  governed by the common law of the cayman islands 
the common law of the cayman islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the cayman islands as well as from english common law  the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority  but are not binding on a court in the cayman islands 
the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the united states 
in particular  the cayman islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states  and some states  such as delaware  have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law 
in addition  cayman islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the united states 
the cayman islands courts are also unlikely 
table of contents to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the united states based on certain civil liability provisions of us securities laws  and to impose liabilities against us  in original actions brought in the cayman islands  based on certain civil liability provisions of us securities laws that are penal in nature 
there is no statutory recognition in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states  although the courts of the cayman islands will in certain circumstances recognize and enforce a non penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits 
the grand court of the cayman islands may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere 
certain differences in corporate law in the cayman islands and the united states could discourage or prevent our acquisition 
cayman islands companies are governed by  among others laws  the companies laws 
the companies law is modeled on english law but does not follow recent english law statutory enactments  and differs from laws applicable to united states corporations and their shareholders 
set forth below is a summary of some significant differences between the provisions of the companies law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the united states and their shareholders 
mergers and similar arrangements 
cayman island law does not provide for mergers as that expression is generally understood under the corporate laws of the various states of the united states 
while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances  commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a scheme of arrangement which may be tantamount to a merger  reconstructions and amalgamations can be achieved through other means to these statutory provisions  such as a share capital exchange  asset acquisition or control  through contractual arrangements  of an operating business 
in the event that these statutory provisions are used which are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states  the arrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent three fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors  as the case may be  that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting  or meeting summoned for that purpose 
the convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the grand court of the cayman islands 
while a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not be approved  the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself that we are not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with  the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question  the arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve  and the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the companies law or that would amount to a fraud on the minority 
when a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of of the shares to which the offer applies within four months  the offeror may  within a two month period  require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer 
an objection can be made to the grand court of the cayman islands but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud  bad faith  collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders 
if the arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved  the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights  which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of united states corporations  providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares 
shareholders suits 
our cayman islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been successfully brought in a cayman islands court 
in principle  we will normally be the proper plaintiff and a claim against us for example or our officers or directors may not be brought by a shareholder 
however  based on english authorities  which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be applied by a court in the cayman islands  exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which a company is acting or proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of its authority  the act complained of  although not beyond the scope of the authority  could be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of votes which have actually been obtained  or 
table of contents those who control the company are perpetrating a fraud on the minority 
a shareholder may have a direct right of action against the company where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed or are about to be infringed 
enforcement of civil liabilities holders of ordinary shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands 
the cayman islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and provides significantly less protection to investors 
additionally  cayman islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states 
although there is no statutory enforcement in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states  the courts of the cayman islands will recognize a foreign judgment as the basis for a claim at common law in the cayman islands provided such judgment is given by a competent foreign court  imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given  is final  is not in respect of taxes  a fine or a penalty  and was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands
