table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
outlook the company has taken or will take a number of actions to deliver improved earnings in cost reductions  including global rationalization of the company s product lines  remain a priority for the company throughout  in order to offset the impacts from reimbursement and pricing pressures  the global economic crisis and the potential volatility in the value of the us dollar 
the company will also look to increase prices in regions where sourcing has led to increased costs due to us dollar strength 
for regions that already increased prices during  we expect to receive additional benefit from those changes during the first part of the year 
finally  with declining commodity costs  the company expects to have a more favorable purchasing environment in than was the case in the company has two key challenges at the start of first  as previously communicated  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms announced us reimbursement cuts of for those product categories which had been included in phase one of the now delayed national competitive bidding ncb program 
these us cuts were effective january  in addition to the reduction on oxygen reimbursement from medicare mentioned above  the deficit reduction act s limit on months of rental payments for home oxygen went into effect january  cms has clarified that payments do restart after months of a patient s usage of oxygen 
invacare s new respiratory products for example  the low cost homefill oxygen delivery system  however  can help offset the reimbursement cuts that the home care provider is receiving from medicare 
secondly  the global financial crisis has negatively impacted the company s earnings by strengthening the us dollar  which lowers the translation of overseas profits 
separately  the financial crisis could impact the company s supplier and customer base  although there does not appear to be a material change in either at this point 
the company intends to remain judicious in its extension of credit to customers and to review supplier financial strength  particularly on key products and components 
with these factors in mind and despite the pressures from both lower reimbursement and the stronger us dollar  the company plans on improving earnings with organic growth and market share gains 
the projected increase in earnings is substantial in light of the weaker overseas profits due to foreign currency translation effects 
with cost reductions  including the global rationalization of invacare s product lines  the company envisions as the next step in stronger earnings at invacare 
organic sales growth  earnings and cash flow for are expected to be consistent with the guidance provided in the company s january  press release

the company is currently  and expects to be in  in compliance with all covenant requirements 
under the most restrictive covenant of the company s borrowing arrangements as of december   the company had the capacity to borrow up to an additional  via the company s revolving credit facility  provided that this capacity is not necessarily available to fund acquisitions by the company 
the company s borrowing arrangements impose restrictions regarding the establishment of intercompany loans and thus  cash transfers 
those restrictions can have a negative impact on the company s ability to meet liquidity needs  particularly in the united states 
while there is general concern about the potential for rising interest rates  the company believes that its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is manageable given that portions of the company s debt are at fixed rates for extended periods of time  the company has the ability to utilize swaps to exchange variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  if needed  and the company s free cash flow should allow it to absorb any modest rate increases in the months ahead without any material impact on its liquidity or capital resources 
as of december   the weighted average floating interest rate on borrowings was 
as is the case for many companies operating in the current economic environment  the company is exposed to a number of risks arising out of the global credit crisis

although the company has taken actions in an effort to mitigate these risks  during periods of economic downturn  the company s exposure to these risks increases 
events of this nature may adversely affect the company s liquidity or sales and revenues  and therefore have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
capital expenditures there are no individually material capital expenditure commitments outstanding as of december  the company estimates that capital investments for could approximate  to  compared to actual capital expenditures of  in the company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents  together with funds generated from operations and existing borrowing facilities  will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements and fund required capital expenditures for the foreseeable future

in preparing the financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition invacare s revenues are recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers 
the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  as updated by sab no 
 provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap to selected revenue recognition issues

shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
sales are made only to customers with whom the company believes collection is reasonably assured based upon a credit analysis  which may include obtaining a credit application  a signed security agreement  personal guarantee and or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer 
credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and or other relevant financial information 
existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts

table of contents the company offers discounts and rebates  which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized 
discounts offered include cash discounts for prompt payment  base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers 
volume discounts and rebates are given based on large purchases and the achievement of certain sales volumes 
product returns are accounted for as a reduction to reported sales with estimates recorded for anticipated returns at the time of sale 
the company does not sell any goods on consignment 
distributed products sold by the company are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections  delivery and returns 
product sales that give rise to installment receivables are recorded at the time of sale when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with dll  a third party financing company  to provide the majority of future lease financing to invacare customers 
as such  interest income is recognized based on the terms of the installment agreements 
installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments  interest income is no longer recognized 
all installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology  regardless of duration of the installment agreements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from health care  medical equipment dealers and long term care facilities located throughout the united states  australia  canada  new zealand and europe 
a significant portion of products sold to dealers  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on dealer liquidity and profitability 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customer 
in addition  as a result of the third party financing arrangement  management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company s limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company continues to closely monitor the credit worthiness of its customers and adhere to tight credit policies

to forecast future cash flows 
the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the year treasury rate for the risk free rate  a market risk premium  the industry average beta  a small cap stock adjustment and company specific risk premiums 
the assumptions used are based on a market participant s point of view and yielded a discount rate of to in compared to to in the discount rate has fluctuated in the last years by less than basis points 
if the discount rate used were basis points higher for the impairment analysis  the company would still not have an impairment for any of the reporting units 
while there was no indication of impairment in related to goodwill or intangibles for any reporting units  a future potential impairment is possible for any of the company s reporting units should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis 
furthermore  the company s annual valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the market inputs used to determine the discount rate change significantly 
for instance  higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the discount rate and thus increase the chance of impairment

historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the third party actuary to estimate the ultimate reserves 
for example  the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience  that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate 
estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss award settlements on claims

table of contents the company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
fas  fair value measurements  which created a framework for measuring fair value  clarified the definition of fair value and expanded the disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
fas did not require any new fair value measurements 
the company adopted the new standard as of january  for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the adoption had no material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  such as goodwill and intangibles  the company elected to adopt as of january  the provisions of fas as allowed pursuant to fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
the adoption of fas for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis had no material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations sfas r  which changed the accounting for business acquisitions 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes principles and requirements as to how an acquirer should recognize and measure in its financial statements the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest and goodwill acquired 
sfas r also requires expanded disclosure regarding the nature and financial effects of a business combination 
the company adopted sfas r as of january  and the adoption had no material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas r could have a material impact on the company s financial statements in future periods if the company completes significant acquisitions in the future 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
the company adopted sfas effective january  and is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption will have on the company s financial statement disclosures 
on may   the fasb issued fasb staff position apb fsp apb to provide clarification of the accounting for convertible debt that can be settled in cash upon conversion 
the fasb believed this clarification was needed because the accounting being applied for convertible debt does not fully reflect the true economic impact on the issuer since the conversion option is not captured as a borrowing cost and its full dilutive effect is not included in earnings per share 
the fsp requires separate accounting for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt in a manner that would reflect invacare s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the company had to bifurcate a component of its convertible debt as a component of stockholders equity and will accrete the resulting debt discount as interest expense 
the company adopted fsp apb effective january  and  as a result  the company expects that reported interest expense will increase and net earnings will decrease by approximately  or per share in  assuming no material change in weighted average shares outstanding during fsp apb requires retrospective application upon adoption and accordingly  amounts for and will be restated in the financial statements 
the impact on and will be to increase reported interest expense and decrease reported earnings by  per share and  per share  respectively

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk through various financial instruments  including fixed rate and floating rate debt instruments 
the company uses interest swap agreements to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
based on december  debt levels  a change in interest rates would impact interest expense by approximately  additionally  the company operates internationally and  as a result  is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
specifically  the exposure results from intercompany loans and third party sales or payments 
in an attempt to reduce this exposure  foreign currency forward contracts are utilized 
the company does not believe that any potential loss related to these financial instruments would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s current financing agreements  established in february  provided the company with total capacity of approximately  the  revolving credit facility has the earliest expiration date  which is february accordingly  the company s exposure to the volatility of the current market environment is limited as the company does not currently need to re finance any of its debt 
however  the company s borrowing arrangements contain covenants with respect to  among other items  maximum amount of debt  minimum loan commitments  interest coverage  dividend payments  working capital  and debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined in the company s bank agreements and agreement with its note holders 
the company is in compliance with all covenant requirements  but should it fall out of compliance with these requirements  the company would have to attempt to obtain financing in the current market environment and thus likely be required to pay much higher interest rates
