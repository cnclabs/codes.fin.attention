these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable  based upon the information available 
our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements 
the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra s reported financial results 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
other items that affect our revenue recognition include customer returns customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
historically  our product returns have not been significant 
however  if a significant issue should arise  it could have a material impact on our financial statements 
growth rebates some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year 
these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
each quarter  we estimate the amount of outstanding growth rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history 
historically  actual growth rebates have been in line with our estimates 
price protection some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve  which is charged against revenue 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal 
software revenue we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows 
table of contents our enterprise solutions group has fixed fee software implementation projects  for which we use the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition 
under this method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
our printers contain embedded firmware  which is part of the hardware purchase 
we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it 
we sell a limited amount of prepackaged  or off the shelf  software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers 
there is no customization required to use this software  and we have no post shipment obligations on the software 
revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped 
we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project 
we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware 
revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer 
we recognize license revenue under statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  when a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
maintenance and support agreements we enter into post contract maintenance and support agreements 
revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred 
shipping and handling we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
zebra enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type 
this bundle of products might include printers  current or future supplies  and services 
when this type of transaction occurs  we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the recognition criteria for that product is fully met 
investments and marketable securities investments and marketable securities at december   consisted of the following us government securities state and municipal bonds corporate bonds we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
trading and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
as of december   zebra s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale 
in addition  as of december   all of our investments in marketable debt securities with 
table of contents maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments on the balance sheet due to our ability to hold them until maturity 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for the fair value discussion of auction rate security investment valuations 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  an active collection effort by regional credit functions  reporting directly to the corporate financial officers  and credit insurance on the majority of our international revenues 
we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
over the last three years  accounts receivable reserves varied from to of total accounts receivable 
accounts receivable reserves as of december   were  or of the balance due 
we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december  while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first in  first out fifo method  or the current estimated market value 
we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
over the last three years  our inventory reserves have ranged from to of gross inventory 
as of december   inventory reserves were  or of gross inventory 
we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual assessment during june and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of may goodwill of a reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
examples of such events or circumstances include significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  testing for recoverability under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statement of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit  or allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed of 

table of contents due to the deterioration of the economy and a significant reduction in the price of our stock  we performed an interim test of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of and determined that the goodwill associated with our esg segment was impaired 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this impairment charge 
we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in zebra s stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets  we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain impairment indicators existed related to identified intangible assets in both our spg and esg businesses and conducted a special impairment test of intangibles 
this test resulted in an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this impairment charge

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio 
as stated in our written investment policy  the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 
zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers  investment liquidity  and broad diversification across investment strategies  and which limits the types of investments that may be made 
moreover  the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis

as of december  interest rate sensitive instruments percentage point movement effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax percentage point movement effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax because these securities are classified as available for sale under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the impact of a one percentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 
foreign exchange risk we conduct business in approximately countries throughout the world and  therefore  are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates 
we generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable 
we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies 
we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussions of hedging activities
