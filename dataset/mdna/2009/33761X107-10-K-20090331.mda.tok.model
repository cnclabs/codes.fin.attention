firstcity s investments include million and million in the form of debt investments and control oriented direct equity investments  respectively  under its special situations platform firstcity denver 
the special situations platform allows us to invest in us middle market companies  where we believe the supply of primary capital is limited and the investment opportunities are attractive 
the company s investments also include million of sba loan originations and advances through its majority owned subsidiary american business lending  inc abl 
the company believes that the ability to purchase and originate small business loans provides the diversity to create an attractive growth opportunity within the domestic market 
at december   firstcity s earning assets portfolio assets  equity investments  debt investments  entity level earning assets and investment security approximated million 
table of contents compared to million a year ago 
firstcity s global distribution of earning assets at carrying value at december  included million in the united states  million in europe  and million in latin america 
the company s earnings in were negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction losses  and net impairment provisions  declining collections  and rising asset level expenses related to the company s domestic consolidated portfolios and partnerships foreign currency transaction losses the combined impact of foreign currency transactions from the company s consolidated and non consolidated foreign operations resulted in a million foreign currency exchange loss in compared to a combined impact of million in foreign currency exchange gains in 
the global distribution of the company s combined foreign currency exchange loss in included million of exchange losses from european operations and million of exchange losses from latin american operations 
net impairment provisions  collections and asset level expenses the company incurred million of net impairment provisions in comprised of million of net provisions recorded to our consolidated portfolios  and million as our share of net impairment provisions recorded to portfolio assets held in our partnership interests 
the global distribution of the million of net impairment provisions recorded by the company in includes million in the united states  million in europe  and million in latin america 
the impairment provisions in were attributed primarily to declines in values of loan collateral and real estate assets in our domestic portfolios  and additional delays in the timing of collections of expected cash flows on domestic loan portfolios 
collections on the company s consolidated domestic portfolios decreased to million in from million in  and aggregate collections on portfolios held in non consolidated domestic partnerships decreased to million in from million in firstcity also incurred million of asset level costs ie property taxes  insurance  repairs and legal costs in from its consolidated domestic portfolios to protect the company s security interests in its loan collateral and to support foreclosed properties until they are sold 
these asset level costs are attributed primarily to increased levels of delinquent property tax and insurance payments by the borrowers  and increased loan defaults and foreclosures over the past months 
management believes that declines in real estate values  delayed collections  and rising asset level costs are the resulting adverse effects from a general decline in global economic conditions  and volatility and disruptions in the financial markets which adversely impacts our business due to rising loan defaults and foreclosures on loan collateral because borrowers cannot refinance their loans and or continue to make payments  and significant declines in real estate values due to excess building inventories 
the impairment provisions were identified in connection with management s quarterly evaluation of the collectability of the company s portfolio assets and loans receivable 
the process for evaluating and measuring impairment is critical to our financial results  as it requires subjective and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about the impact of matters that are uncertain 
it remains unclear what impact the illiquid markets  real estate value declines and the overall economic slowdown will ultimately have on our financial results 
therefore  we cannot provide assurance that  in any particular period  we will not incur additional impairment provisions in the future 
in spite of the substantial losses reported in the financial services sector over the past months and downward pressure on economic growth due to a decline in general economic conditions  management remains positive on the outlook of the company 
management believes that current market conditions should not hinder firstcity s ability to expand its business  and that asset acquisition opportunities at attractive margins are available

discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial position and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition portfolio assets the company invests in performing and non performing commercial and consumer loans  real estate and certain other assets portfolio assets or portfolios  and services and resolves such portfolio assets in an effort to maximize the present value of the ultimate cash recoveries 
the portfolio assets are generally non homogeneous assets  including loans of varying qualities that are secured by diverse collateral types and real estate 
some portfolio assets are loans for which resolution is tied primarily to the real estate securing the loan  while others may be collateralized business loans  the resolution of which may be based on the cash flows of the business or the underlying collateral 
on january   firstcity adopted and began accounting for its acquisitions of loan portfolios with credit deterioration in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
sop addresses accounting differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in acquired loans if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to 
table of contents credit quality 
sop requires acquired loans with credit deterioration to be initially recorded at fair value and prohibits carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of acquired loans that are within the scope of sop under sop  the excess cash flows expected at acquisition over the loan portfolio s purchase price is recorded as interest income over the life of the portfolio 
for portfolio assets comprised of loan pools acquired prior to january   the company designated such portfolios as non performing or performing 
the designations were made on the acquisition date of the portfolio and do not subsequently change even though the actual performance of the underlying loans may change 
the following is a description of the classifications and related accounting policies for the company s various classes of portfolio assets loans acquired prior to for portfolio assets acquired before january   the company initially recorded the purchased assets at cost  and acquisition date purchase discounts and loan loss allowances of the underlying assets were included as components of the cost and carrying value of the portfolio assets  as applicable 
income recognition for loans acquired prior to is based on management s initial designation of the purchased portfolio assets as non performing or performing 
such designations were made on the acquisition date and do not subsequently change even though the actual performance of the portfolio assets may subsequently change 
the following describes the company s accounting policies for performing and non performing portfolio assets acquired prior to non performing portfolio assets acquired prior to non performing portfolio assets acquired prior to consist primarily of distressed loans and loan related assets ie foreclosed loan collateral 
prior to january   portfolio assets were designated as non performing if a majority of the loans in the portfolio was significantly under performing in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements at the date of acquisition 
income on non performing portfolio assets is recognized only to the extent that collections exceed a pro rata portion of allocated cost from the pool 
cost allocation is based on a proration of actual collections divided by total estimated collections of the pool 
interest income is not recognized separately on non performing portfolio assets 
all collection proceeds  of whatever type  are included in the determination of income recognition for these portfolio assets 
the company accounts for these non performing portfolio assets on a pool basis 
performing portfolio assets acquired prior to performing portfolio assets acquired prior to consist primarily of portfolios of consumer and commercial loans acquired at a discount from the aggregate contractual amounts of the borrowers obligations 
portfolio assets were designated by management as performing if substantially all of the loans in the portfolio were being paid in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements at the date of acquisition 
performing portfolio assets are carried at the unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans  net of unamortized acquisition discounts and allowance for loan losses 
income on portfolio assets is recognized using the interest method  based on the portfolio s internal rate of return irr  and acquisition discounts for the portfolios as a whole are accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated life of the respective portfolios 
income on performing portfolio assets is accrued monthly based on each loan pool s effective irr 
significant increases in expected future cash flows may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the irr over a portfolio s remaining life 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing 
cash flows greater than the interest accrual will reduce the carrying value of the pool 
likewise  cash flows that are less than the accrual will increase the carrying balance 
the irr is estimated based on the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows using the company s proprietary collection model 
gains are recognized on performing portfolio assets when sufficient funds are received to fully satisfy the obligation on loans included in the pool  either from collections received from the borrower or proceeds received from the sale of the loan 
the gain recognized represents the difference between the 
table of contents proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the individual loan in the pool 
the company accounts for these performing portfolio assets on a pool basis 
impairment of loans acquired prior to the company evaluates and measures impairment for these performing and non performing portfolio assets on a pool basis at least quarterly 
management s estimate of irr as of january  is the basis for subsequent impairment testing for these portfolio assets acquired prior to if it is probable that a pool s cash flows estimated at acquisition plus any expected cash flow changes arising from changes in estimates after acquisition will not be collected  the carrying value of the pool will be reduced by establishing an allowance through provisions charged to operations to maintain the then current irr 
a pool can become fully amortized zero basis carrying value on the balance sheet while still generating cash collections 
in this case  all cash collections are recognized as income when received 
additionally  the company uses the cost recovery method when timing and amount of collections on a particular pool of accounts cannot be reasonably predicted 
under the cost recovery method  no income is recognized until the company has fully collected the cost of the portfolio  or until such time that the company considers the collections to be probable and estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
loans acquired after a substantial portion of the company s loans acquired after have experienced deterioration of credit quality between origination and the company s acquisition of the accounts 
the amounts paid for the loans reflect the company s determination the loans have experienced deterioration in credit quality since origination and that it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the underlying loans 
at acquisition  the company reviews the loan portfolio both by account and aggregate pool to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the account s contractual terms 
the following describes the company s accounting policies for non performing and performing loan portfolios acquired after loans with credit deterioration acquired after commencing january   firstcity adopted and began accounting for its acquisitions of loan portfolios with credit deterioration in accordance with the provisions of sop as permitted by sop  the company generally establishes static pools for purchased loan accounts that have common risk characteristics primarily loan type and collateral 
each static pool is accounted for as a single unit for the recognition of income  principal payments and loss provision 
once a static pool is established  individual accounts are generally not added to or removed from the pool unless the company sells  forecloses or writes off the loan 
at acquisition  firstcity determines the excess of the loan pool s scheduled contractual payments over all cash flows expected to be collected as an amount that should not be accreted nonaccretable difference 
the excess of the portfolio s cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition over the initial investment in the portfolio accretable yield is generally accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the portfolio 
the discount ie the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because the company does not expect to fully collect each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  loan portfolios are generally recorded at cost which approximates fair value at the time of acquisition 
in accordance with sop  the company accounts for its investments in sop loan portfolios using either the interest method or the cost recovery method 
application of the interest method is dependent on management s ability to develop a reasonable expectation as to both the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected 
in the event the company cannot develop or 
table of contents establish a reasonable expectation as to both the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected  sop permits the use of the cost recovery method 
under the interest method  an effective interest rate  or internal rate of return irr  is applied to the cost basis of the pool 
sop requires that the excess of the contractual cash flows over expected cash flows not be recognized as an adjustment of income or expense or on the balance sheet 
sop initially freezes the irr that is estimated when the loan accounts are purchased as the basis for subsequent impairment testing performed at least quarterly 
significant increases in actual  or expected future cash flows  is used first to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan pool  and any remaining increase may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the irr over the portfolio s remaining life 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing and income recognition 
under sop  subsequent decreases in projected cash flows do not change the irr  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the pool to maintain the then current irr  and are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations through provisions charged to operations  with a corresponding valuation allowance off setting the loan portfolio in the consolidated balance sheets 
firstcity establishes valuation allowances for loan portfolios acquired with credit deterioration to reflect only those losses incurred after acquisition that is  the cash flows expected at acquisition that are not expected to be collected 
income from loan portfolios accounted for under the interest method is accrued based on each pool s irr applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
gross collections in excess of the interest accrual and impairments will reduce the carrying value of the static pool  while gross collections less than the interest accrual will increase the carrying value 
the irr is estimated based on the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows using the company s proprietary collection models 
a pool can become fully amortized zero basis carrying balance on the balance sheet while still generating cash collections 
in this case  cash collections are recognized as income when received 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a loan pool are not reasonably estimable  the company accounts for such portfolios on the cost recovery method 
under the cost recovery method  no income is recognized until the company has fully collected the cost of the portfolio  or until such time the company considers the timing and amount of collections to be reasonably estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
at least quarterly  the company performs an evaluation to determine if the remaining amount that is probable of collection is less than the portfolio s carrying value  and if so  recognizes impairment through provisions charged to operations 
at december  and  the carrying value of sop loan pools accounted for under the cost recovery method approximated million and million  respectively 
loans without credit deterioration acquired after loans acquired without evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition for which firstcity has the positive intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment and reported at their unpaid principal balance net of unamortized purchase discounts or premiums 
differences between the initial investment and the related loan s principal amount at the purchase date are recognized as an adjustment of interest income over the life of the loan 
income on the loans is recognized under the interest method 
interest accrual generally ceases when payments become days contractually past due 
a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  management establishes an allowance for loan losses through a provision charged to operations 
at least quarterly  management evaluates the need for an allowance on an individual loan basis by considering information about specific borrower situations  estimated collateral values  general economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
loans are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 

table of contents loans receivable loans receivable consist of loans made to affiliated entities including acquisition partnerships and non affiliated entities  and purchased and originated us small business administration sba loans 
the repayment of the loans is generally dependent upon future cash flows of the borrowers  future cash flows of the underlying collateral  and distributions made from affiliated entities 
interest is accrued when earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans 
loan origination fees and costs  as well as purchase premiums and discounts  are amortized as level yield adjustments over the respective loan terms 
unamortized net fees  premiums or discounts are recognized upon early repayment or sale of the loans 
the company evaluates loans receivable for impairment on an individual loan basis at least quarterly by reviewing the collectibility of the loans in light of various factors  as applicable  such as estimated future cash receipts of the borrower or underlying collateral  historical experience  estimated value of underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions  and industry concentrations 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
a loan is considered impaired if it is probable that the company will not ultimately collect all principal or interest amounts contractually due 
loans that experience insignificant payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  the company generally ceases to accrue interest on the note and unpaid interest is reversed against interest income 
when ultimate collectibility of the impaired note is in doubt  all collections are generally applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been recovered  and collections thereafter are recognized as interest income 
impairment losses are charged against an allowance account through provisions charged to operations in the period impairment is identified 
loans are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
deferred tax asset we record income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the sfas more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment for a valuation allowance  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of net assets  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  and tax planning alternatives 

table of contents during the fiscal year ended december   we established a full valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the valuation allowance was established due to the lack of objectively verifiable evidence regarding the realization of these assets in the foreseeable future 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that effective in the fourth quarter of we have incurred a three year cumulative loss and also considered the general decline in global economic conditions over the past year  which dramatically weakened in the fourth quarter of  causing a significant increase in our pre tax loss due primarily to significantly higher impairments of certain loan and real estate portfolios 
regardless of the deferred tax valuation allowance established in  the company continues to retain net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million available to off set future federal taxable income  if any  through the year to the extent that the company generates taxable income in the future to utilize the tax benefits of the related deferred tax assets  subject to certain potential limitations  it may be able to reduce its effective tax rate by reducing the valuation allowance 
we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results  including further market deterioration  may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates could have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations see item a

these estimates of future cash receipts from acquired portfolio asset pools are utilized in four primary ways i to calculate the allocation of cost of sales of non performing portfolios  ii to determine the effective yield of performing portfolios  iii to determine the reasonableness of settlement offers received in the liquidation of the portfolio assets  and iv to determine whether or not there is impairment in a pool of portfolio assets 
the company uses a proprietary asset management software program to manage the portfolio assets it owns and services 
each asset within a pool is analyzed by an account manager who is responsible for analyzing the characteristics of each asset within a pool 
the account manager projects future cash receipts and expenses related to each asset and the sum of which provides the total estimated future cash receipts related to a particular purchased asset pool 
these estimates are routinely monitored by the company to determine reasonableness of the estimates provided

r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  the company consolidates any variable interest entities vie of which it is the primary beneficiary 
in general  a vie is an entity that has total equity at risk that is not sufficient to finance its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support from other entities  where the group of equity owners does not have the ability to make significant decisions about the entity s activities  where the group of equity owners does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns generated by its operations  or both  or where the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the losses or the right to receive residual returns of the entity  or both  and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
if any of these characteristics is present  the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation analysis  and consolidation is based on variable interests  and not solely on ownership of the entity s outstanding voting stock 
variable interests are generally defined as contractual  ownership or other economic interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
the primary beneficiary consolidates the vie  the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that absorbs a majority of expected losses or receives a majority of residual returns if the losses or returns occur  or both 
the company also consolidates entities not deemed to be vies in which it holds  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting interests or where it exercises control in accordance with arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
the company does not consolidate equity investments in to owned acquisition partnerships or other entities that are not vies where the company owns less than a majority controlling interest  or equity investments in to owned acquisition partnerships or other entities that are vies where the company is not the primary beneficiary 
rather  such investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting since the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investees operating and financial policies 
the company also accounts for non consolidated equity investments in less than owned affiliates mainly acquisition partnerships under the equity method of accounting 
firstcity has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these entities  despite its comparatively smaller ownership percentage  due primarily to its active participation in the policy making process as well as its involvement in the daily management activities 
these entities are formed to share in the risks and rewards in developing new markets as well as to pool resources 
distributions of cash flow from the acquisition partnerships are a function of the terms and covenants of the loan agreements related to the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships 
generally  the terms of the underlying loan agreements permit some distribution of cash flow to the equity partners so long as loan to cost and loan to value relationships are in compliance with the terms and covenants of the applicable loan agreement 
once the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships are fully paid  all cash flow in excess of operating expenses is available for distribution to the equity partners 
equity earnings in most of the foreign acquisition partnerships are recorded on a one month lag due to the timing of firstcity s receipt of those financial statements

in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas 
fsp fas applies to financial assets within the scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements under sfas  and clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active 
fsp fas states that an entity should not automatically conclude that a particular transaction price is determinative of fair value 
in a dislocated market  judgment is required to evaluate whether individual transactions are forced liquidations or distressed sales 
when relevant observable market information is not available  a valuation approach that incorporates management s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset in a current sale transaction would be acceptable

 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in specified situations 
such servicing assets or liabilities would be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  and subsequently measured at amortized value or fair value based upon an election of the reporting entity 
sfas also specifies certain financial statement presentations and disclosures in connection with servicing assets and liabilities 
the company elected to measure the servicing assets  subsequent to the date of sale  by using the amortization method which amortizes servicing assets in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assesses servicing assets for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date 
the adoption of sfas by the company on january  did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
on december   the company adopted sec staff accounting bulletin topic n  financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be evaluated when determining the materiality of misstatements in the current year financial statements and it also addresses how to correct material misstatements 
the company s adoption of sab resulted in an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year ended december  by approximately  all of which relates to the company s investments in certain acquisition partnerships accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
approximately  reflects a correction to write off cumulative translation adjustments related to certain foreign investments during the periods through  and approximately  reflects a correction in a partnership s accounting for property taxes in the remaining  reflects the company s correction of accounting for equity earnings on a pro rata basis recorded in an acquired investment subsequent to the acquisition date 
the company reviewed the annual amount of reduced equity earnings incurred in prior periods for these corrections and considered the effects to be immaterial to prior periods both individually and in the aggregate 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s operations are materially impacted by net gains on sales of loans and net interest margins 
the level of gains from loan sales the company achieves is dependent on demand for the products originated 
net interest margins are dependent on the company s ability to maintain the spread or interest differential between the interest it charges the customer for loans and the interest the company is charged for the financing of those loans 
the following describes each component of interest bearing assets held by the company and how each could be affected by changes in interest rates 
the company invests in portfolio assets both directly through consolidated subsidiaries and indirectly through equity investments in acquisition partnerships 
portfolio assets consist of investments in pools of non homogenous assets that predominantly consist of loan and real estate assets 
earnings from these assets are based on the estimated future cash flows from such assets and recorded when those cash flows occur 
the underlying loans within these pools bear both fixed and variable rates 
due to the non performing nature and history of these loans  changes in prevailing benchmark rates such as the prime rate or libor generally have a nominal effect on the ultimate future cash flow to be realized from the portfolio assets 
loans receivable consist primarily of loans made to affiliated entities including acquisition partnerships and non affiliated entities  and generally bear interest at fixed rates 
the repayment of the loans is generally dependent upon future cash flows of the borrowers  future cash flows of the underlying collateral  and distributions from affiliated entities 
since these loans are predominantly fixed rate financial instruments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the collectibility of these loans 
sba loans receivable were million at december   of which million were related to the guaranteed portion of these loans 
the guaranteed portion is backed by the full faith and credit of the us small business administration  and is generally sold into the secondary market 
virtually all of the sba loans have variable interest rates 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have a minimal effect on interest income from sba loans for although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet  and other business developments that could affect a net increase decrease in assets 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate 
firstcity had million in debt outstanding at december  the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its variable rate debt  which totaled million or of the company s total debt 
a basis point change in interest rates would increase or decrease firstcity s annual interest expense by approximately million annually 

table of contents foreign currency risk the company currently has loans and equity investments in europe  latin america ie mexico  argentina  dominican republic  brazil and chile and canada 
in europe and in mexico  the company s investments are primarily in the form of equity and represent a significant portion of the company s total equity investments 
as previously discussed  the revolving acquisition facility with bank of scotland for million allows loans to be made in euros up to a maximum amount in euros that is equivalent to million us dollars 
at december   the company had million in euro denominated debt for the purpose of hedging a portion of the net equity investments in europe 
in november  the company entered into a loan agreement with banco santander  sa that allows loans to be made in mexican pesos 
at december   the company had  in mexican peso denominated debt  which was equivalent to million us dollars 
management of the company feels that these loan agreements will help reduce the risk of adverse effects of currency changes on these investments 
a sharp change in the foreign currencies related to the investments in europe  and latin america relative to the us dollar could materially adversely affect the financial position and results of operations of the company 
a and incremental depreciation of these currencies would result in an estimated decline in the valuation of the company s foreign investments and are indicated in the following table 
these amounts are estimates  consequently  these amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual effect of such changes with respect to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
one us dollar equals estimated decline in valuation of investments resulting from incremental depreciation of foreign currency of dollars in thousands europe eur   mexico mxn   chile clp brazil brl argentina ars
