item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form k  particularly in risk factors 
overview we have developed the first and only commercially available intelligent robotic radiosurgery system  the cyberknife system  designed to treat solid tumors anywhere in the body as an alternative to traditional surgery 
the cyberknife system combines continuous image guidance technology with a compact linear accelerator that has the ability to move in three dimensions according to the treatment plan 
our image guidance technology continuously acquires images to track a tumor s location and transmits any position corrections to the robotic arm prior to delivery of each dose of radiation 
our compact linear accelerator  or linac  is a compact radiation treatment device that uses microwaves to accelerate electrons to create high energy x ray beams to destroy the tumor 
this combination  which we refer to as intelligent robotics  extends the benefits of radiosurgery to the treatment of tumors anywhere in the body 
the cyberknife system autonomously tracks  detects and corrects for tumor and patient movement in real time during the procedure  enabling delivery of precise  high dose radiation typically with sub millimeter accuracy 
the cyberknife procedure requires no anesthesia  can be performed on an outpatient basis and allows for the treatment of patients that otherwise would not have been treated with radiation or who may not have been good candidates for surgery 
in addition  the cyberknife procedure avoids many of the potential risks and complications that are associated with other treatment options and is more cost effective than traditional surgery 

table of contents in july  we obtained k clearance from the fda to market the cyberknife system for the treatment of tumors and certain other conditions in the head  neck and upper spine 
in august  we received fda clearance for the treatment of tumors anywhere in the body where radiation treatment is indicated 
in september  we received a ce mark for the sale of the cyberknife system in europe 
we received approval for full body treatment in japan in june  previously our cyberknife regulatory approvals in japan were limited to treatment for indications in the head and neck 
the cyberknife system has also been approved for various indications in korea  taiwan  china and other countries 
our customers have reported that over  patients worldwide have been treated with the cyberknife system since its commercial introduction 
in the united states  we sell to customers  including hospitals and stand alone treatment facilities  directly through our sales organization 
outside the united states  we sell to customers in over countries directly and through distributors 
we have sales and service offices in paris  france  hong kong  china  tokyo  japan  madrid  spain  new delhi  india  singapore  moscow  russia  munich  germany  istanbul  turkey and london  uk 
as of june   we had employees in our sales organization 
our cyberknife systems are either sold to our customers or placed with our customers pursuant to our shared ownership program 
as of june   we had cyberknife systems installed at customer sites  including sold and two pursuant to our shared ownership program 
of the systems sold and installed  are in the americas  are in asia and are in europe 
in addition to selling the cyberknife system to customers through direct sales  we offer alternative arrangements to customers who may not have the financial means to purchase a cyberknife system 
for example  under our shared ownership program  we retain title to the cyberknife system while the customer has use of the system 
our shared ownership contracts generally require a minimum monthly payment from the customer  and we may earn additional revenue through the use of the system at the site 
generally  minimum monthly payments are equivalent to the revenue generated from treating three to four patients per month  and any revenue received from additional patients is shared between us and the customer 
we expect to continue to offer our shared ownership program to new customers 
the shared ownership program typically has a term of five years  during which the customer has the option to purchase the system at pre determined prices 
at june   we had two systems installed under our shared ownership program 
during the years ended june   and  million  million and million  respectively  of total revenue was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the sale of two  twelve and one cyberknife system units  respectively  that were formerly under our shared ownership program 
at june  and   and million  respectively  of amounts for extended warranty and training services related to these sold shared ownership units remained recorded as deferred revenue  and will be recognized over the life of the extended warranty service period and as training service obligations are fulfilled 
we manufacture and assemble our cyberknife systems at our manufacturing facility in sunnyvale  california 
we purchase major components  including the robotic manipulator  the treatment table or robotic couch  the magnetron  which creates the microwaves for use in the linear accelerator  the imaging cameras and the computers  from outside suppliers  some of which are single source 
our reliance on single source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely and cost effective manner 
however  in most cases  if a supplier were unable to deliver these components  we believe that we would be able to find other sources for these components subject to any regulatory qualifications  if required 
we manufacture certain other electronic and electrical subsystems  including the linear accelerator 
we then assemble and integrate these components with our proprietary software and perform testing prior to shipment to customer sites 
we generate revenue by selling the cyberknife system and by providing ongoing services and upgrades to customers following installation of the cyberknife system 
the current united states list price for the cyberknife system ranges from approximately million to million depending 
table of contents upon system configuration and options purchased by the customer 
the list price typically includes initial training  installation  and a one year warranty 
we also offer optional hardware and software  technical enhancements and upgrades to the cyberknife system  as part of our multiyear service plans 
currently  our most comprehensive service plan is our diamond elite multiyear service plan  or diamond plan 
under our diamond plan  customers are eligible to receive up to two upgrades per year  when and if available 
through june   the diamond plan listed for  per year and provided for annual renewals for four years including the one year warranty period 
effective july   the diamond plan lists for  per year and typically provides for annual renewals for up to five years including the one year warranty period 
the customer may cancel the service plan at any time 
as of june   of our customers had purchased service plans 
prior to introducing our diamond plan  we offered legacy service plans  some of which continue to have future upgrade obligations 
in these cases  revenue  including cyberknife product revenue  is recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contract once all upgrade obligations have been satisfied 
the cyberknife procedure is currently covered and reimbursed by medicare and other governmental and non governmental third party payors 
medicare coverage currently exists in the hospital outpatient setting and in the free standing clinic setting 
for calendar year  the national unadjusted average medicare payment rates under healthcare common procedure coding system  or hcpcs  are  under code g  the billing code for the first treatment  and  under code g  the billing code for each of the second thru fifth treatments  approximately and percent less than payment rates  respectively 
payment for the free standing clinic setting is governed by the final medicare physician fee schedule 
for and  payment for hcpcs codes g and g in the freestanding clinic settings for first and subsequent treatments were set by the local medicare carrier and rates may vary from no payment to a payment rate exceeding the hospital outpatient payment rates 
we do not anticipate a significant impact of this rule on our business or results of operations 
in addition to medicare reimbursement to hospitals and clinics  physicians receive reimbursement for their professional services in the hospital outpatient setting and the free standing clinic setting 
payment to physicians is based on the medicare physician fee schedule  and payment amounts are updated on an annual basis 
for  the american medical association  or ama  issued guidance that deleted current procedural technology  or cpt  code  the category i cpt code describing physician work delivering radiosurgery services  and issued the following new cpt codes      and  all relating to neurosurgical procedures that should be used for intracranial and spinal procedures only 
medicare and third party payors will require the use of these new cpt codes to describe physician services for radiosurgery services using our technology for cranial and spinal procedures 
radiosurgery procedures in other anatomies require physicians to bill unlisted cpt codes with no assigned payment rates 
payment rates for unlisted codes are set by the local medicare carrier and rates may vary from no payment to rates equivalent to the comparable cpt rates for the series of cpt codes 
the inability of physicians to obtain reimbursement under the new cpt codes or any related unlisted or successor cpt codes could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
our total net revenue was million  million  and million during the years ended june    and  respectively 
our net income loss was  million  and million during the years ended june    and  respectively 
our net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million  and million during the years ended june    and  respectively 
as of june   our backlog as further discussed under backlog below was approximately million 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in the market 
to compete successfully  we will need to continue to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over alternative procedures  products and technologies  and convince physicians and other healthcare decision makers of the advantages of our products and 
table of contents technologies 
our business and sales and installation cycle does not immediately create recognizable revenue 
as such  we must invest in sales and marketing activities up to months prior to realizing the revenue from those activities 
our ability to achieve and maintain long term profitability is largely dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell the cyberknife system and to control our costs and effectively manage our growth 
financial operations sales and installation cycle the cyberknife system has a relatively long sales and installation cycle because it is a major capital item and requires the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions 
the typical sales and installation cycle is up to months in duration and involves multiple steps 
initial steps may include pre selling activity followed by sales presentations and other sales related activities 
after the customer has expressed an intention to purchase a cyberknife system  we typically negotiate and enter into a terms agreement setting forth the business and economic terms for the sale or acquisition of the cyberknife system and multiyear service plan 
after execution of a terms agreement  the customer typically has a specified time window in which to complete final negotiation of legal terms for the sale or acquisition of the cyberknife system 
we bifurcated the process of negotiating agreements on business and legal terms in order to reduce the level of sales force involvement in negotiation of legal terms and improve the efficiency of our customer contracting process 
nevertheless  many customers  particularly in international markets  choose to negotiate a full purchase agreement at the time of sale 
the last step in the sales and installation cycle is installation of the cyberknife system 
prior to installation  a purchasing institution must typically obtain a radiation device installation permit  and in some cases  a certificate of need  or con  both of which must be granted by state and local government bodies 
recently  as a result of healthcare cost considerations and sensitivity to the cost of major capital equipment items  some state con boards have become more aggressive in the evaluation of con applications 
this trend  if it continues  may make the con process more protracted and uncertain 
in addition  the purchasing institution must build a radiation shielded facility or upgrade an existing facility to house the cyberknife system 
we typically receive a deposit at the time the terms agreement or full purchase agreement is entered into  or shortly thereafter  and the remaining balance for the sale of the cyberknife system upon delivery and installation 
the customer also typically selects a service plan at the time of signing a cyberknife system terms agreement and enters into the service plan agreement prior to installation of the system 
upon installation  we typically recognize the cyberknife system sale price less the fair value of one year of service 
we recognize the fair value of the first year of service as revenue pro rata over the twelve months following installation 
in addition  if the customer has purchased our diamond plan and assuming annual renewals  we would receive payment at the beginning of each of the second  third  fourth and fifth years of the multiyear service plan and recognize that revenue pro rata over each year 
legacy service plans prior to introducing our diamond plan  we offered a platinum elite multiyear service plan  or platinum plan 
this legacy service plan was structured so that we have an obligation to deliver two upgrades per year over the course of the multiyear service plan 
if we fail to deliver the upgrades  our customers are entitled to receive a refund of up to  for each upgrade not offered 
to date  no refunds have been required pursuant to the platinum plan 
beginning in november  we phased out offering this legacy service plan to new customers 
the platinum plan obligates us to deliver up to two upgrades per year during the term of the contract 
we have not established fair value for those future obligations  hence  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires that we cannot begin to recognize any of the revenue derived from the sale of the cyberknife system or the associated service plan until all upgrade obligations have been fulfilled 
therefore  the payments made by our customers who have our 
table of contents legacy platinum plan are categorized as deferred revenue 
once we fulfill all upgrade obligations with respect to a specific platinum plan  we ratably recognize the revenue from the sale of the cyberknife system and the platinum plan over the remaining life of the contract 
upgrades customers may purchase additional upgrades as optional extras prior to the delivery of all originally specified upgrade obligations 
such additional upgrades are considered elements of the original arrangement and associated revenues are deferred until the earlier of delivery of all elements  or establishment of vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for all undelivered elements 
sales of additional upgrades after delivery of all specified upgrade obligations  as stated in the original contract  are considered separate arrangements and are recognized once all revenue recognition criteria applicable to the separate arrangements are met 
warranty all customers purchasing a cyberknife system receive a one year warranty 
in circumstances where we have vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements  we recognize the cyberknife system purchase price minus the fair value of one year of support upon installation  and we recognize the value of one year of support ratably over the twelve months following installation 
shared ownership program revenue as of june   our shared ownership program involved us sites only 
we recognize revenue monthly from our shared ownership program that consists of a minimum monthly payment 
we also recognize usage based revenue in excess of the monthly minimum based on usage reports from our customers 
we recognized revenue from our shared ownership program of million  million  and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
in limited cases  we received nonrefundable upfront payments from shared ownership program customers which are treated as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the contract 
the cyberknife system shared ownership systems are recorded within property and equipment and are depreciated over their estimated life of seven years 
depreciation and warranty expense attributable to shared ownership systems are recorded within cost of shared ownership program as they are incurred 
japan customized service revenue in may and december  we entered into separate contractual arrangements to deliver customized upgrade services to our distributor in japan for cyberknife systems previously sold 
these customized upgrade services consist of two upgrade levels and are being delivered over an extended period concurrent with the distributor s efforts to coordinate delivery with their end user customers 
the obligations under the upgrade programs for these systems were completed as of september  we no longer offer this customized service program and instead offer our standard multiyear service plans 
international sales revenue for international sales  we recognize revenue once we have met all of our obligations associated with the purchase agreement  other than for undelivered service elements for which we have vsoe of fair value 
in most cases  this occurs after the distributor has shipped the unit to the end user or provided evidence of proof of sell through to end user  assuming all of our remaining obligations have been satisfied 
payments are sometimes secured through letters of credit 
in situations where we are directly responsible for installation  we recognize revenue once we have installed the cyberknife system and have confirmed performance against specification 

table of contents in situations with legacy plans where we have future obligations related to upgrades that are subject to potential refunds  we defer revenue from the sale and service of the cyberknife system until the final upgrade has been delivered and accepted 
after we have delivered all upgrades associated with a service plan and thus eliminated any contractual right to a refund  we ratably recognize the revenue from the sale of the cyberknife system and the plan over the remaining life of the contract or until we have vsoe of the fair value of remaining undelivered elements 
net revenue from international customers was million  million  and million for the years ended june    and  respectively 
backlog backlog consists of the sum of deferred revenue  future uninvoiced payments that our customers are contractually committed to make and signed contingent contracts that we believe have a substantially high probability of being booked as revenue from cyberknife system sale agreements  service plans and minimum payment requirements associated with our shared ownership program 
contingencies associated with contingent contracts that are included within backlog may include state or local government approval of a certificate of need for the installation of a radiosurgery system  approval by the board of directors of the hospital or other purchaser of the system and establishment of financing and formation of legal entities by purchasers of systems and  in the case of terms agreements  final negotiation and agreement upon our legal terms for the purchase or acquisition of the cyberknife system 
in addition  in some cases in which customers negotiate full purchase agreements  these agreements are also subject to certain contingencies 
we review  on a quarterly basis with respect to each contingent contract included in backlog  whether customer engagement and progress toward satisfaction of contingencies warrant continued inclusion of the contract within backlog 
at june   our non contingent backlog  which consists of contracts that have satisfied all contingencies  was approximately million  as compared to million at june  of this non contingent backlog  million represented cyberknife system sales at june   as compared to million at june   and million represented revenue from service plans and other recurring revenues at june   as compared to million at june  the contingent portion of backlog was million at june   as compared to million at june  total backlog was million at june   of which million represented cyberknife sales and million represented other recurring revenues  as compared to million at june   of which million represented cyberknife sales and million represented other recurring revenues 
we anticipate that this backlog will be recognized over the next five years as installations occur  upgrades are delivered and services are provided 
although backlog includes contractual commitments from our customers  we may be unable to convert this entire backlog  including the entire non contingent backlog  into recognized revenue due to factors outside our control 
as we have indicated during fiscal  beginning with fiscal year we will no longer provide information about contingent backlog 
we think that such information is of limited use in building financial models 
orders that we consider to be contingent will not disclosed until all contingencies have been cleared 
for the current quarter  the data that we have provided as to the amounts of both contingent and non contingent backlog are based on the methodology that we have used throughout fiscal as part of the transition in our reporting methods  we also plan to refine our definition of backlog in fiscal to enhance the usefulness of this information in analyzing and building models of our business 
orders that do not meet those refined criteria will not be reported as backlog 
in terms of trends  this is likely to lead to a reduction in backlog in the first quarter of fiscal from what was previously reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal wholly apart from the amount of new orders received in the first quarter 

table of contents results of operations overview our results of operations are divided into the following components net revenue 
our net revenue consists primarily of product revenue revenue derived primarily from the sale of cyberknife systems and the sale of linacs for other uses  shared ownership program revenue revenue generated from our shared ownership program  services revenue revenue generated from sales of service plans and training and other revenue revenue from specialized upgrade services for units previously sold in japan and other specialized services 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor and overhead costs 
in future periods  we expect cost of revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on system configurations ordered by our customers and overall revenue mix 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs for personnel and costs associated with participation in medical conferences  physician symposia  and advertising and promotional activities 
we expect marketing expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of major marketing events  such as significant trade shows 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of activities associated with our product development  regulatory  and clinical study arrangements 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance  in house legal  and human resources  and external expenses related to accounting  legal and other consulting fees 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments  unrealized losses on our long term trading securities  net of unrealized gains on our put option  foreign currency transaction gains and losses  losses on fixed asset disposals  and state and local sales and use tax fines and penalties 
we expect interest income to decrease in the near future in response to the recent decline in interest rates  offset by unrealized gains on our long term trading securities  net of unrealized losses on our put option 
deferred revenue platinum multiyear service plans we are required to defer all of the revenue associated with our legacy multiyear service plans  including our platinum plan  until we have satisfied all of the specified obligations related to the delivery of upgrades to the cyberknife system during the life of the service plan 
this includes deferring revenue for the cash received for the purchase of the cyberknife system and multiyear service plans until we have delivered all upgrades which the customer is eligible to receive 
once we have satisfied our obligations for delivery of upgrades under the plan  we recognize revenue ratably over the remaining life of the service plan 
we have not offered the platinum service plan to new customers since we phased it out when we introduced our diamond plan in november prior to fiscal we had installed the final upgrades and recognized all revenue on systems sold under gold agreements 
as of the end of june we had installed the final upgrade on all but one system sold under platinum agreements 
we recognized approximately million of revenue related to these platinum agreements in fiscal we anticipate that we will install final upgrades in the remaining platinum system and recognize the balance of remaining deferred platinum revenue over the next two years  with approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents years ended june    and net revenue years ended june  in thousands net revenue products shared ownership program services other total net revenue for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  during the year ended june   cyberknife systems were installed  of which were sold and one was attributable to our shared ownership program  compared to systems installed  including units sold and four attributable to our shared ownership program during the year ended june  excluding revenue recognized for systems sold under our platinum plan  we recognized million of product revenue in fiscal  associated with cyberknife systems  which included units sold and two units purchased out of in our shared ownership program 
by comparison  during fiscal  we recognized product revenue of million associated with cyberknife systems  which included units sold and units purchased out of our shared ownership program 
the decrease in fiscal is due primarily to the sale in fiscal of twelve cyberknife systems that had been in our shared ownership program for an aggregate purchase price of million offset partially by the increase from to units sold not related to our shared ownership program 
excluding revenue recognized for systems sold under our platinum plan  we recognized non platinum service revenue of million for the year ended june   which increased approximately million from the year ended june   due to the continued growth in our installed base under service plans 
as of june  and  and of our customers  respectively  had purchased non platinum service plans 
we recognized million of revenue in fiscal from systems sold under our platinum plan  million for product revenue and million for service revenue 
we recognized million of revenue in fiscal from systems sold under our platinum plan  million for product revenue and million for service revenue 
by the end of june we had satisfied all upgrade delivery obligations on of the units sold under our platinum plan 
once all upgrade delivery obligations have been satisfied  revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the contract service term 
we anticipate that revenue recognized from systems sold under our platinum plan will decline to approximately million in and million in shared ownership program revenue for the year ended june  decreased approximately million from the year ended june   primarily due to the sale of cyberknife systems through the year ended june  that had been in our shared ownership program 
we anticipate revenue from our shared ownership program will decrease in future periods due to the sale of the shared ownership systems through june  revenue from upgrade services in japan  classified as other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended june   decreased approximately million from the year ended june  due to a decrease in upgrade services provided to our installed systems in japan 
total net revenue for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  during the year ended june   we installed cyberknife systems  including 
table of contents units sold and four attributable to our shared ownership program 
during the year ended june   cyberknife systems were installed  of which units were sold and two units were attributable to our shared ownership program 
excluding revenue recognized under our platinum plan during the year ended june   we recognized product revenue of million associated with cyberknife systems  which included units sold and twelve units sold that had been in our shared ownership program 
during the year ended june   we recognized product revenue of million associated with cyberknife systems  which included units sold and one unit that had been in our shared ownership program 
the increase in product revenue was primarily attributable to the sale of twelve cyberknife systems that had been in our shared ownership program for an aggregate purchase price of million during the year ended june  also  during the year ended june   we satisfied all revenue recognition criteria for seven units previously sold to a distributor in china and recognized million of product revenue related to these units 
we recognized non platinum service revenue of million for the year ended june  which increased approximately million from the year ended june   primarily due to the continued growth in our installed base under service plans 
as of june  and  and of our customers  respectively  had purchased non platinum service plans 
for system units attributable to our platinum plan  we recognized revenue of million of revenue recognized from system units  of which million was attributable to product revenue and million was attributable to service revenue 
during the year ended june   we recognized revenue of million from system units attributable to our platinum plan  of which million was attributable to product revenue and million was attributable to service revenue 
shared ownership program revenue for the year ended june  remained relatively consistent from the year ended june  revenue from upgrade services in japan  classified as other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended june   increased approximately million from the year ended june  due to an increase in upgrade services provided to our installed systems in japan 
gross profit years ended june  dollars in thousands of net revenue dollars in thousands of net revenue dollars in thousands of net revenue gross profit products shared ownership program services other gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the year ended june  decreased slightly from the year ended june  this decrease is attributable to increases in the mix of the proportion of services revenue as a percentage of total net revenues  which have higher costs of revenue as compared to product revenue and decrease in shared ownership revenues as a percentage of total net revenues  which have lower costs of revenue as compared to product revenue 
the increase in service revenue margins was attributable mainly to an increase in platinum service margins due to high margins on five platinum systems that were fully recognized during the year ended june   in accordance with the final upgrades being installed at these sites during the final period of the service contract term  compared to one site that was fully recognized during the year ended june  
table of contents shared ownership program revenue as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended june  decreased primarily due to the sale of two cyberknife systems that had been in our shared ownership program during the year ended june  compared to the sale of cyberknife systems that had been in our shared ownership program during the year ended june  gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the year ended june  decreased from the year ended june  due mainly to a decrease in margins for product revenues plus an increase in service revenues  which have high costs of revenue 
the decrease in products revenue margins was attributable mainly to an increase in sales of cyberknife systems that were previously in our shared ownership program and an increase in cyberknife system shipments through our distributor channel during the year ended june   both of which typically have lower gross margins than conventional cyberknife system sales 
we recognized revenue associated with the sale of and one cyberknife systems that had been in our shared ownership program during the years ended june  and  respectively 
also during the year ended june   we satisfied all revenue recognition criteria for seven systems previously sold to a distributor in china and recognized million of non recurring product revenue related to these systems 
no such systems were sold during the year ended june  selling and marketing expenses years ended june  dollars in thousands sales and marketing of net revenue selling and marketing expenses for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in sales commissions due to an increase in sales and previously paid amounts that were expensed for employees terminated during the year ended june   an increase of  in expenses primarily related to contribution made to the cyberknife society  and an increase of  in severance related charges recorded under the plan 
selling and marketing expenses for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in salary and related costs  including stock based compensation  largely due to increased headcount and an increase of million in facility and operational costs as a result of the continuing expansion of our international sales presence

table of contents other income  net years ended june  dollars in thousands other income  net of net revenue other income  net for the year ended june  decreased million from the year ended june  primarily due to a decrease of million in interest income due to a decrease in both the average daily balances kept in interest bearing accounts and the interest rates earned on amounts kept in those accounts during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and net unrealized losses of  related to the change in fair value of our trading securities 
other income  net for the year ended june  increased million from the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to higher average daily balances kept in interest bearing accounts  as a result of receiving proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo  in february  for months during the year ended june  compared to only five months during the year ended june  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
for the year ended june   we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  related to our adoption effective july   of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and  sfas r  related to our accounting for stock based compensation 
we had previously accounted for our stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  which permitted us to either estimate forfeitures in determining our stock based compensation expense or to adjust the expense at the time forfeitures occurred 
sfas r requires that we estimate forfeitures 
since we had previously adjusted our stock based compensation expense at the time forfeitures occurred  we have included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the adjustment to reflect forfeitures related to compensation expense recorded in prior periods 
provision for income taxes years ended june  dollars in thousands provision for income taxes of net revenue the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  decreased  from the year ended june  in fiscal  we recorded a decrease in foreign taxes of  as compared to the prior year as the result of changes in our jurisdictional mix of income 
we also recorded a decrease in federal and state taxes of  as compared to the prior year due to the carryback of a current year net operating loss to the prior year 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june   decreased  from the year ended june  in fiscal  we recorded a decrease in foreign taxes of  as compared to the prior year as the result of the recognition of tax benefits associated with the utilization of foreign net operating losses 
we also recorded a decrease in federal and state alternative minimum taxes  or amt  of  primarily due to a decrease in taxable income resulting from an increase in stock option deductions available under sfas r in the current year 
as of june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are available to 
table of contents offset against future taxable income  if any  in varying amounts and will begin to expire beginning in and for federal and state purposes  respectively 
such net operating loss carryforwards include tax benefits from employee option exercises in excess of the stock based compensation expense that has been recognized for those awards in accordance with sfas r 
we will record approximately million as a credit to additional paid in capital if and when such excess benefits are ultimately realized 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in  while the state tax credits have no expiration date 
in addition  among other matters  realization of the entire deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards 
due to the inconsistent history of net operating income as adjusted for permanent differences  we cannot conclude that the net domestic deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our domestic net deferred tax assets 
at june   there was no provision for us income tax for undistributed earnings as it is currently our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us if repatriated  these earnings could result in a tax expense at the current us federal statutory tax rate of  subject to available net operating losses and other factors 
subject to limitation  tax on undistributed earnings may also be reduced by foreign tax credits that may be generated in connection with the repatriation of earnings

stock based compensation expense effective july   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and b based on the previous requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under previous literature 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
stock based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures for the years ended june   and such that expense was recorded only for those stock based awards that are expected to vest 
for the years ended june   and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for stock options  employee stock purchase plan  or espp  options and restricted stock units granted to employees 
during the years ended june   we recognized  of stock based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of stock options and rsus in conjunction with non recurring employee separation costs  included in the total compensation amounts above 
no such expenses were recognized during the years ended june  and for the year ended june   we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  related to the adoption of sfas r since we had previously adjusted stock based compensation expense at the time forfeitures occurred in accordance with sfas the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle reflects estimated forfeitures related to periods prior to july  
table of contents as of june   there was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures  of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options  espp options and restricted stock units which we expect to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
during the years ended june    and  we recognized   and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to non employees 
for certain stock option grants  we made modifications to the option terms 
these modifications included extensions of the vesting period and acceleration of vesting 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents decreased by  this decrease was primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities of million  and was partially offset by cash provided by investing activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million 
in november  we obtained a line of credit with ubs 
the line of credit is due on demand and allows for borrowings of up to of par value of ars 
no borrowings were outstanding as of june  we believe that we have sufficient cash resources and anticipated cash flows to continue in operation for at least the next months 
years ended june    and cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended june  our net income of  during fiscal year was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  of million  and an increase in inventories of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily a result of the timing difference between the shipment of products and the receipt of customer payment 
the decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  was primarily a result of the recognition of revenue previously deferred for systems sold under our platinum plan offset partially by differences between invoicing customers for products and services and the recognition of the invoicing as revenue 
the increase in inventories was due primarily to an increase in our business volume and the increase in our worldwide installed base and associated service inventory requirements 
positive cash flow from working capital changes include an increase in accrued liabilities of million of which million was related to the inventory investigation in the first quarter and the balance was due to the timing differences between the receipt of goods and service and vendor payments 
non cash charges included million of stock based compensation  million of charges for write downs of inventory and million of depreciation and amortization expense 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended june  our net income of million during fiscal year was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  of million  and an increase in inventories of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily a result of the timing difference between the shipment of products and the receipt of customer payment 
the decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  was primarily a result of the timing of differences between invoicing customers under service contracts and the recognition of revenue over the contractual service period  the continued satisfaction of specified obligations to begin revenue recognition for units covered by our platinum plans and the recognition of revenue and cost of revenue for units previously shipped to a distributor in china 
the increase in inventories was due primarily to an increase in our business volume 
non cash charges included million of stock based compensation and million of depreciation and amortization expense 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended june  our net loss of million during fiscal year was offset by non cash charges of million of depreciation and amortization expense  and million of stock based compensation offset by the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  due to the adoption of sfas r 

table of contents other significant working capital changes that contributed to positive cash flows provided by operations in fiscal included an increase in accounts payables of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million and an increase in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue of million 
the increase in accounts payable was due to increases in the volume of our business and the increase in accrued liabilities was due to increases in compensation related accruals due to increased headcount 
the increase in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  was primarily a result of the timing differences between invoicing customers under service contracts and the recognition of revenue over the contractual service period  and the continued satisfaction of specified obligations to begin revenue recognition for units covered by our platinum service plans 
offsets to positive cashflow included an increase in inventories of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and a decrease in customer advances of million due to an increase in the number of systems shipped 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended june  and was attributable to a decrease in restricted cash of million and net marketable security activities of million  which consisted of million of sales and maturities of marketable securities offset by million in purchases 
we also used million of cash for purchases of property and equipment 
the decrease in restricted cash is due to the release of amounts related to contracts with customers requiring that deposited cash amounts be secured via letter of credit until delivery of the cyberknife unit occurs 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june  and was attributable to net investment of our excess cash and cash equivalents in higher yielding investment accounts of million  which consisted of million of purchases and million of sales and maturities of marketable securities  million of purchases of property and equipment  and million of restricted cash activity 
the increase in investment activity during the year ended june  is due primarily to the january investment of proceeds from our initial public offering in february the increase in restricted cash is due to arrangements in contracts with customers requiring that deposited cash amounts be secured via letter of credit until delivery of the cyberknife unit occurs 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june   which was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of million 
purchases of property and equipment in all periods were due to the expansion of our facilities and operations 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended june  and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and the purchase of common stock under our espp 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended june  and was primarily attributable to stock repurchases of million  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of million and proceeds from our espp of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended june  and was primarily attributable to net proceeds from our initial public offering of million and proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of million 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following revenue generated by sales of the cyberknife system  our shared ownership program and service plans  
table of contents costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of the cyberknife system  effects of competing technological and market developments  and number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if these sources of cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional financing may not be available at all  or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table is a summary of our non cancelable contractual cash obligations  net of sublease income as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases sublease income total off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business and operating results during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies including the more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from the sale of our products  our shared ownership program  and the provision of related services  which can include installation services  post contract customer support  or pcs  training and consulting 
our products and upgrades to those products include software that is essential to the functionality of the products and accordingly  we account for the sale of our products pursuant to statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  or sop  as amended 
we record our revenues net of any value added or sales tax 
from time to time  we introduce customers to third party financing organizations 
no amounts received from these third party financing organizations are at risk 
we recognize product revenues for sales of the cyberknife system  replacement parts and accessories when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and delivery has occurred as prescribed by sop payments received in advance of product shipment are recorded as customer advances and are recognized as revenue or deferred revenue upon product shipment or installation 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate arrangement consideration to services and pcs based upon vsoe of fair value of the respective elements 
vsoe of fair value for the services element is based upon our standard rates charged for the products or services when such products or services are sold separately or based upon the price established by management having the relevant authority when that service is not yet being sold separately 
when contracts contain multiple elements  and vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements  principally the cyberknife system  based upon the residual method as prescribed by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions  or sop if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all the undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until the earlier of delivery of all elements  or establishment of vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements 
cyberknife sales with legacy service plans for sales of cyberknife systems with pcs arrangements that include specified or committed upgrades for which we have not established vsoe of fair value  all revenue is deferred until the specified or committed upgrades are delivered 
in such cases  once all upgrade obligations have been delivered  all deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining life of the pcs arrangement 
sales of additional upgrades as optional extras prior to the delivery of all originally specified upgrade obligations are considered additional elements of the original arrangement and associated revenues are deferred and accounted for as described above 
sales of additional upgrades after delivery of all specified upgrade obligations  as stated in the original contract  are recognized once all revenue recognition criteria applicable to those arrangements are met 
cyberknife sales with nonlegacy service plans in fiscal year  we began selling cyberknife systems with pcs contracts that only provide for upgrades when and if they become available 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of pcs in these circumstances 
for arrangements with multiple elements that include the cyberknife system  installation services  training services and a pcs service agreement  we recognize the cyberknife system and installation services revenue following installation and acceptance of the system by application of the residual method as prescribed in sop no 
when vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements in the arrangement  including pcs 

table of contents other revenue japan upgrade services other revenue primarily consists of upgrade revenues related to the sale of specialized services specifically contracted to provide current technology capabilities for units previously sold through a distributor into the japan market 
the upgrade programs include elements where vsoe of fair value has not been established for the pcs 
as a result  associated revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the pcs arrangement  generally four years 
pcs and maintenance services service revenue for providing pcs  which includes warranty services  extended warranty services  unspecified when and if available product updates and technical support is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period  generally one year  until no further obligation exists 
at the time of sale  we provide for the estimated incremental costs of meeting product warranty if the incremental warranty costs are expected to exceed the related service revenues 
training and consulting service revenues  that are not deemed essential to the functionality of the cyberknife system  are recognized as such services are performed 
costs associated with providing pcs and maintenance services are expensed when incurred  except when those costs are related to units where revenue recognition has been deferred 
in those cases  the costs are deferred until the recognition of the related revenue and are expensed over the period of revenue recognition 
distributor sales sales to third party distributors are evidenced by distribution agreements governing the relationships together with binding purchase orders or signed quotations on a transaction by transaction basis 
we record revenues from sales of cyberknife systems to distributors based on a sell through method where revenue is only recognized upon shipment of the product to the end user customer or we are provided evidence of proof of sell through to the end user  and once all revenue recognition criteria are met including completion of all our obligations under the terms of the purchase order 
for sales of upgrades and accessories to distributors  revenue is recognized on either a sell through or sell in basis  depending upon the terms of the purchase order and once all revenue recognition criteria are met 
these criteria require that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and there is no right of return 
our agreements with customers and distributors generally do not contain product return rights 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we will defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of cash 
shared ownership program we also enter into arrangements under our shared ownership program with certain customers 
under the terms of such program  we retain title to our cyberknife system  while the customer has use of the product 
we generally receive a minimum monthly payment and earn additional revenues from the customer based upon their use of the product 
we may provide unspecified upgrades to the product during the term of each program when and if available 
upfront  non refundable payments from the customer are deferred and recognized as revenue over the contractual period 
revenues from our shared ownership program are recorded as they become earned and receivable and are included within shared ownership program revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
the cyberknife systems associated with our shared ownership program are recorded within property and equipment and are depreciated over their estimated useful life of seven years 

table of contents depreciation and warranty expense attributable to the cyberknife shared ownership systems are recorded within cost of our shared ownership program 
long term manufacturing contracts we also recognize revenue and cost of revenue related to long term manufacturing contracts using contract accounting on the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
during the years ended june    and  contract revenue of million  million  and  respectively  was recorded with related costs of million   and  respectively 
we recognize any loss provisions from the total contract in the period such loss is identified 
during the year ended june   increases in projected costs to complete were sufficient to create a loss position for certain projects 
as such  an estimated loss provision of  was recognized during the year ended june  no loss provision was recognized during the years ended june  or as of june  and  costs of and million  respectively  were recorded in deferred cost of revenue related to long term manufacturing contracts 
deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue deferred revenue consists of deferred product revenue  deferred shared ownership revenue  deferred service revenue and deferred other revenue 
deferred product revenue arises from the timing differences between the shipment of products and satisfaction of all revenue recognition criteria consistent with our revenue recognition policy 
deferred shared ownership revenue results from the receipt of advance payments of monthly minimum lease payments  which will be recognized ratably over the term of the shared ownership program 
deferred service revenue results from the advance payment for services to be delivered over a period of time  usually one year 
service revenue is recognized ratably over the service period 
deferred other revenue results primarily from the japan upgrade services programs and is due to timing difference between the receipt of cash payments for those upgrades and final delivery to the end user customer 
deferred cost of revenue consists of the direct costs associated with the manufacture of units  direct service costs and deferred costs associated with the japan upgrade services for which the revenue has been deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
deferred revenue  and associated deferred cost of revenue  expected to be realized within one year are classified as current liabilities and current assets  respectively 
stock based compensation effective july   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and b based on the previous requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under previous guidance 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
for the year ended june   we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  net of tax of  related to the adoption of sfas r since we had previously adjusted stock based compensation expense at the time forfeitures occurred in accordance with sfas the cumulative effect of this change in accounting reflects estimated forfeitures related to periods prior to july  under sfas r  we estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the table below 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies 
the expected term of options is based upon the vesting term ie  on the first anniversary of the vesting start 
table of contents date and equal monthly installments thereafter and on its partial life history 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury constant maturity rate 
during the years ended june   and  the estimated fair values of the stock options granted were calculated at each date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  using fair values of common stock between and per share 
following our ipo  the fair value of our common stock is determined by its closing market price as published by the nasdaq global market 
during the years ended june   and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees

 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
we believe that the fair value of the stock options is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the services received 
the estimated fair value of the stock options granted is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  as prescribed by sfas  using fair values of common stock and weighted average assumptions during the year of grant 
we recognized   and  during the years ended june    and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to non employees 
in january  in connection with our ipo  the board of directors approved the incentive award plan  or plan  and the espp 
the espp is deemed compensatory and compensation costs are accounted for under sfas r 
under the espp  qualified employees are entitled to purchase common stock at of the fair market value on specified dates

expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded companies 
the expected term is based upon the offering period of the espp 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the espp option is based on the us treasury constant maturity rate

realized excess tax benefits for the years ended june   and were   and  respectively 
at june  and   and  of capitalized stock based compensation costs were included as components of inventory and deferred cost of revenue 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
excess and obsolete inventories are written down based on historical sales and forecasted demand  as judged by management 
we determine inventory and product costs  which include allocated production overheads  through use of standard costs 
investments we account for certain assets in accordance with sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period 
the election  called the fair value option  will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
in november  we entered into an agreement rights agreement with ubs  which provides us with ars rights rights to sell our ars at par value to ubs at any time during the period june  through july  these rights are a separate freestanding instrument accounted for separately from the ars  and are registered  nontransferable securities accounted for as a put option initially recorded at fair value 
under the rights agreement  ubs may  at its discretion  purchase or sell the ars at any time through july  without prior notice to us and must pay us par value for the ars within one day of the sale transaction settlement 
we agreed to release ubs from certain potential claims related to its marketing and sale of ars 
additionally  ubs offered us a no net cost loan up to the par value of the ars as determined by ubs until june  and we agreed to release ubs from certain potential claims related to the collateralized ars in certain specified circumstances 
during the three months ended december   we elected fair value accounting for the put option recorded in connection with the rights agreement 
this election was made in order to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by accounting for the purchased put option and underlying ars under different methods 
the initial election of fair value led to a million gain included in other income  net for the put option asset  which is recorded in long term trading securities 

table of contents due to our entering into this rights agreement with ubs and enabling ubs to sell the ars at any time  the ars previously reported as available for sale have been transferred to trading securities and are classified as long term trading securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of june  due to the change in classification to trading securities at the time of entering into the rights agreement  we transferred the previously accumulated unrealized loss of million from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to other income  net and recorded additional unrealized gains of million relating to the change in fair value of the trading securities from november through june  at june   the total fair value of the ars was million  net of million of unrealized losses 
additionally  we recorded unrealized gains of million related to the fair value of the put option at the time we entered into the rights agreement and recorded additional unrealized losses relating to the change in fair value of the put option from november through june  of million  for a total fair value of the put option of million as of june  during the year ended june   the million unrealized loss in fair value of the ars and the million of unrealized loss on the put option  partially offset by the million gain recognized on the put option  resulted in a net  decrease to other income  net 
we account for investments in accordance with sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
in february  the fasb issued fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement fsp fas  which provided a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
level other observable inputs available at the measurement date  other than quoted prices included in level  either directly or indirectly  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non active markets  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data 
level unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment 
these values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents provision for income taxes estimates and significant management judgment are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  we record a valuation allowance equal to the amount of our net domestic deferred tax assets 
if we subsequently determine that it is more likely than not we will be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets  we will record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a credit to earnings in the period such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment to sfas no 
the new standard eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets  and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  and an entity s continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets

item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions 
for the year ended june   all of our executed sales contracts were denominated in us dollars  with the exception of three sales contracts one denominated in euros  one in british pounds and one in swiss francs 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the united states 
for direct sales outside the united states it is likely we will sell in the local currency  which could expose us to additional foreign currency risks  including changes in currency exchange rates 
some of our commissions related to sales of the cyberknife system are payable in euros 
to the extent that management can predict the timing of payments under these or contracts we enter into that are denominated in foreign currencies  we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate such risks in the future 
interest rate risk at june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million invested in other financial instruments 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
we believe that while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  and except as described below  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
however  should interest rates increase  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell before scheduled maturity 
if overall interest rates had risen by basis points  the fair value of our net investment position at june  would have decreased by approximately  assuming consistent levels 

table of contents credit risk the million of ars we held as of june  failed at auction and have continued to fail at auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
as of june   we have written down our ars from their par value of million to the estimated fair value of approximately million 
the million decline in market value was recorded to other expense during the year ended june  in conjunction with our decision to reclassify the ars from the available for sale category to the trading category 
in addition  we entered into a settlement agreement with ubs whereby we have the option to sell the ars at par value to ubs between june  and july  as part of the settlement with ubs  we have entered into a no net cost secured line of credit agreement with ubs 
the secured line of credit allows borrowings as determined by ubs 
the available borrowings afford us additional cash liquidity until we exercise our option to sell at par value  expected to be on or about june  as of june   no borrowings are outstanding on this line of credit 
based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents  our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
