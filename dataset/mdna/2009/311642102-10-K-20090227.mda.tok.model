critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company has selected its critical accounting policies for purposes of explaining the methodology used in the calculation in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the possible effects on its financial condition 
the critical policies discussed below are the company s processes of recognizing revenue  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  and the reserve for warranties 
these policies affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing the company s financial and operating status 
these policies involve certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could create an adverse impact on the company s operations and financial position 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well 
table of contents as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience along with various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by the company s management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  the company believes that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue related to the company s measurement equipment and related software is generally recognized upon shipment as the company considers the earnings process substantially complete as of the shipping date 
revenue from sales of software only is recognized when no further significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and where the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred  and the sales price is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible 
revenues resulting from sales of comprehensive support  training and technology consulting services are recognized as such services are performed 
extended maintenance plan revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the plan 
the company warrants its products against defects in design  materials and workmanship for one year 
a provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expense is recorded when products are shipped 
costs relating to extended maintenance plans are recognized as incurred 
revenue from the licensing agreements for the use of the company s technology for medical applications is recognized when the technology is sold by the licensees 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory since the value of inventory that will ultimately be realized cannot be known with exact certainty  the company relies upon both past sales history and future sales forecasts to provide a basis for the determination of the reserve 
inventory is considered obsolete if the company has withdrawn those products from the market or had no sales of the product for the past months  and has no sales forecasted for the next months 
inventory is considered excess if the quantity on hand exceeds months of remaining usage 
the resulting obsolete and excess parts are then reviewed to determine if a substitute usage or a future need exists 
items without an identified current or future usage will be reserved in an amount equal to of the fifo cost of such inventory 
the company s products are subject to changes in technologies that may make certain of its products or their components obsolete or less competitive  which may increase its historical provisions to the reserve 
income taxes the company reviews its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based upon expected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income over a two year period  and tax planning strategies that it might employ to utilize such assets  including net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the positive and negative evidence described in financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company establishes a valuation allowance against the net deferred assets of a taxing jurisdiction in which it operates unless it is more likely than not that it will recover such assets through the above means 
in the future  the company s evaluation of the need for the valuation allowance will be significantly influenced by its ability to achieve profitability and its ability to predict and achieve future projections of taxable income

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

the reserve for warranties the company establishes at the time of sale a liability for the one year warranty included with the initial purchase price of the equipment based upon an estimate of the repair expenses likely to be incurred for the warranty period 
the warranty period is measured in installation months for each major product group 
the warranty reserve is reflected in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the warranty expense is estimated by applying the actual total repair expenses for each product group in the prior period and determining a rate of repair expense per installation month 
this repair rate is multiplied by the number of installation months of warranty for each product group to determine the provision for warranty expenses for the period 
the company evaluates its exposure to warranty costs at the end of each period using the estimated expense per installation month for each major product group  the number of units remaining under warranty and the remaining number of months each unit will be under warranty
