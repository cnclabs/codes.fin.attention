we source our otc products from various manufacturers and distributors 
we also sell advertising on our primary otc site www 
drugstore 
com 
our business strategy is to offer our customers a wide selection of health  beauty  personal care  household  and other products at competitive prices and a superior online shopping experience 
we are able to offer a significantly broader assortment of products  with greater depth in each product category  than brick and mortar drugstores  and provide a broad array of interactive tools and information on our websites to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions 
we believe leveraging our strong capabilities in internet marketing  merchandising  fulfillment  and customer care in the health  beauty  and wellness arena will be a key growth driver for our otc segment 
in  we are focusing on key initiatives such as international market expansion and further development of our medco  rite aid  and new beauty partnerships to accelerate otc growth 
vision 
the vision segment includes contact lenses sold through our wholly owned subsidiary vision direct inc vision direct  through web stores located at www 
visiondirect 
com  www 
lensmart 
com  and www 
lensquest 
com  or over the telephone at visiondirect 
we purchase our contact lens inventory directly from various manufacturers and other distributors 
in  we will continue to focus on balancing customer acquisition with net margin in order to maximize our profits 
mail order pharmacy 
our mail order pharmacy segment includes prescription drugs and supplies  other than prescription contact lenses  sold online through the pharmacy section of the drugstore 
com web store or over the telephone and delivered to customers through our mail order facility 
we procure our prescription inventory through rite aid corporation as part of our ongoing relationship 
we market to both cash paying and insurance covered individuals  and we also serve as a third party provider of mail order prescription fulfillment services for pharmacy benefit managers  or pbms 
we sell over  prescription drugs  including many specialty drugs for the treatment of chronic conditions such as cancer  hiv  and multiple sclerosis  which are not carried by brick and mortar pharmacies and require special handling or service 
in this segment  we focus our marketing efforts directly on consumers online and through doctors to maximize growth in our cash prescription and specialty 
table of contents pharmacy business 
in addition to the sale of prescription drugs  we sell advertising on our website to monetize the large volume of unique visitors per month researching drugs and other healthcare content provided on the site 
in  we anticipate that our mail order pharmacy segment revenues will decline due to the loss of one of our pbm customers as a result of an acquisition in late  but anticipate continued year over year contribution margin improvements 
discontinued operations 
on september   we entered into an amended and restated main agreement with rite aid whereby we transferred to rite aid the rights to our local pick up pharmacy business lpu  which includes prescription refills sold online through the drugstore 
com web store or the rite aid online store and picked up by customers at rite aid stores  in exchange for million  paid in ten monthly installments beginning in september we recorded the purchase price as a deferred gain that we are recognizing over the ten month contractual payment period ending in june additionally  rite aid will pay drugstore 
com ongoing marketing service fees for the continued marketing of rite aid s lpu offering on the drugstore 
com site during the term of the agreement  which continues for two years unless extended for another year by either party 
the marketing service fees are considered indirect cash inflows of our discontinued lpu segment  as we anticipate the fees earned will not be a significant source of ongoing revenue in the future 
the results of operations of our lpu segment have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for all periods presented 
revenues 
we generate revenue primarily from product sales and shipping fees 
in  we reported consolidated total net sales of million  which reflected a million  or  increase over our net sales growth was driven by a year over year increase in our total order volume for  to million orders 
our average net sales per order increased to in  from in our revenues benefited from strong year over year growth in our largest segments  otc and vision of and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a year over year decrease in mail order pharmacy net sales of 
expenses 
our operating expenses  including cost of goods sold  decreased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in in  our overall cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased year over year by basis points due to a favorable shift in our product mix to higher margin otc sales  as well as improvements in our otc and mail order pharmacy margins 
as a percentage of net sales  our improved gross margins in were partially offset by increased fulfillment expenses incurred in our primary distribution center related to process improvement projects  increased marketing expenses resulting from increased paid order volume and increased employee related costs  and increased technology and content expenses resulting from increased depreciation and software maintenance expense driven by the completion of internally developed software projects and the acquisition of software and computer equipment to enhance our websites and it infrastructure  as well as increased it employee related costs 
in  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a million charge in related to estimated sales taxes and interest on an unfavorable ruling on our new jersey sales tax case  and lower stock based compensation expenses  partially offset by increased professional fees related primarily to a consulting project focused on our profitability initiatives 
net loss  cash position

economic environment 
in the fourth quarter  we felt some impact from the current economic downturn  as we saw a less than normal seasonal increase in sales of our discretionary items  such as our holiday gift offerings  and 
table of contents greater utilization of free shipping offers 
we also saw and expect to see elevated response rates to coupons and other promotional offers by increasingly price conscious customers 
that said  we are finding that overall orders are less affected by the economic slowdown  due in part to our value pricing and the non discretionary nature of many of our products 
results of operations customer data we shipped approximately million new customer orders during  increasing our total customer base to million customers since inception 
orders from repeat customers as a percentage of total orders remained consistent year over year at for and orders from repeat customers as a percentage of total orders decreased in from in  primarily as a result of a decrease in repeat orders in our mail order pharmacy segment

significant accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec defines a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the significant accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies that involve the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
we have included additional information about our significant accounting policies in note of our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions  and judgments are reasonable  they are based on information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments  or conditions 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered including advertising revenues  net of sales tax  when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price or fee earned is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
otc vision  and mail order 
we record revenues from sales of otc  vision  and mail order pharmacy when the products are shipped and title passes to customers  net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates  and returns allowances 
we generally require payment by credit card at the point of sale 
we estimate return allowances  which reduce product sales by our estimate of expected product returns  based on our historical experience 
historically  product returns have not been significant and have not differed significantly from our estimates 
from time to time  we provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases 
such offers include discounts on specific current purchases  or future rebates based on a percentage of the current purchase  as well 
table of contents as other offers 
we treat discounts  when our customers accept them  as a reduction in the sales price of the related transaction and we present them as a net amount in net sales 
we treat rebates as a reduction in the sales price based on estimated redemption rates 
we estimate redemption rates using our historical experience for similar offers 
historically  our redemption rates have not differed materially from our estimates  which we adjust quarterly 
prescription sales 
for insured prescriptions in our mail order segment  the co payment and the insurance reimbursement which together make up the amount due to drugstore 
com constitute the full value of the prescription drug sale  and we receive this entire amount as cash 
we therefore recognize the entire amount as revenue when we ship the order to the customer 
we also evaluate the criteria of emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf generally  when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction  are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  or have several but not all of these indicators  we record revenue on a gross basis 
if we are not primarily obligated and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage  a fixed payment schedule  or a combination of the two  we record revenue on a net basis 
consignment and drop ship arrangements 
we record revenues generated by consignment arrangements with gnc and rite aid in our otc segment on a net basis because we do not take title to the inventory and do not establish pricing 
we record revenues generated from our drop ship arrangements with vendors in our otc segment on a gross basis when we are the primary party obligated in a transaction  are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  or have several but not all of these indicators 
strategic partnerships 
we record revenues generated from the amazon 
com marketplace in our otc segment on a gross basis  because we act as a principal  based on the fact that we are subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers 
we record revenues generated by the weil agreement in our otc segment on a net basis  because we act as an agent  based on the fact that we earn a fixed dollar amount per customer transaction regardless of the amount billed to the customer  and we do not bear general inventory risk associated with these sales 
we record revenues generated from the rite aid online store in our otc segment on a gross basis  because we act as a principal  based on the fact that we are subject to inventory and credit risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers 
rite aid earns a percentage of the contribution margin  defined as net sales  less direct costs of these sales and the incremental cost of fulfilling  processing and delivering the order  from the rite aid online store  which is recorded in marketing and sales expense in the statements of operations 
we also evaluate the criteria of emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  when we enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf establishes three criteria that must be met in order for the deliverables in the arrangement to be treated as separate units of accounting  the delivered item has value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
when the separation criteria are not met  the delivered item is accounted for as a combined unit of accounting with the undelivered item 
therefore  revenue for the delivered and undelivered items are recognized over the service period of the last delivered item or if it is not a service  when the last item is delivered 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust our inventories for shrinkage and slow moving  damaged  and expired inventory  which we record as the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on management s assumptions about future demand for 
table of contents the products we offer and market conditions 
we use a variety of methods to reduce the quantity of slow moving inventory  including reducing sales prices on our websites  negotiating returns to vendors  and liquidating inventory through third parties 
if our estimates of future product demand or our assumptions about market conditions are inaccurate  we could understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
historically  inventory reserves have not differed materially from our estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangibles  or sfas  we test for impairment of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever indicators of impairment occur 
the first phase of the test screens for impairment  while the second phase of the test if necessary measures the amount of impairment 
the first phase is performed by comparing the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value is determined using either a discounted cash flow methodology or methodology based on comparable market prices 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
we review our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment occur and annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
we compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value and record an impairment charge when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value 
during fiscal  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units by preparing a discounted cash flow analysis using forward looking projections of our estimated future operating results 
based on the results of the discounted cash flow analysis  we concluded that the fair value exceeds the carrying value  and therefore goodwill is not impaired 
we also considered as an indicator of market value the market value of our common stock during the fourth quarter 
the significant assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis included projected operating results  the discount rate used to present value future cash flows  and capital expenditures 
projected operating results assumptions include sales growth assumptions which are based on historical trends  and to a lesser extent  future sales growth from new strategic partnerships 
also included in projected operating results are gross margin and operating cost growth assumptions which are based on historical relationship of those measures compared to sales

our capital expenditure assumptions are based on our planned capital expenditures for existing and new projects 
sensitivity tests were performed on our significant assumptions and determined that a reasonable  negative change in assumptions would not impact our conclusions 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we review the carrying values of our amortized long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  whenever an indicator of impairment occurs 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  we perform an evaluation of recoverability 
we determine whether impairment exists based on any excess of the carrying value over the expected future cash flows  as estimated through undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges 
we measure any resulting impairment charge based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  as estimated through expected future discounted cash flows  discounted at a rate of return for an alternate investment 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation cost over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we calculate the fair value of our stock 
table of contents options granted to employees using the black scholes option pricing model using the single option approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
we base our computation of expected volatility on our historical volatility  adjusted for changes in capital structure and corporate changes  information available that may indicate future volatility  and observable mean reversion tendencies of historical volatility 
our expected term estimates are based on a comprehensive weighted average life wal analysis 
the wal analysis provides a historical based platform for use in developing expected term estimates for the future based on the historically observed time periods from grant date through post vesting activities  such as exercise and cancellation 
prior to our fourth quarter of  our expected term was calculated using the simplified method outlined by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
under this method  our expected term was equal to the sum of the weighted average vesting term plus the original contractual term divided by two  which resulted in a six year expected term 
we base the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
where the expected term of our stock based awards does not correspond with the terms for which interest rates are quoted  we average the rates quoted for the closest available term maturities 
a dividend yield of is considered appropriate as we have not issued and do not anticipate issuing any dividends in the near future 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider historical voluntary termination behavior in addition to actual option forfeitures 
in conjunction with this analysis  we identified distinct subgroups non management employees  management employees  our chief executive officer  board members  and other non employees 
we apply an estimated forfeiture rate of approximately to non management and management employee subgroups  based on the weighted average termination behavior of those subgroups 
we apply a forfeiture rate of to our chief executive officer  board members  and non employees 
if our estimated forfeiture rate changes  we retrospectively increase or decrease stock based compensation in the period of change 
any such revisions to the estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our stock based awards could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see note of our consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  included in part iv  item of this annual report 
legal proceedings we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates 
any such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position

liquidity and capital resources we have an accumulated deficit of million through december  to date  we have had only one profitable quarter  and we may never achieve profitability on a full year or consistent basis

we have assessed in the past  and will continue to assess  opportunities for raising additional funds by selling equity  equity related or debt securities  obtaining additional credit facilities  or obtaining other means of financing for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms when required  or at all 
furthermore  if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of securities  such securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience additional dilution

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have assessed our vulnerability to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  capital lease obligations  and cash and cash equivalents 
due to the short term nature of these investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments is not material to us 
we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing facilities  which have variable rates 
these variable interest rates are affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage our interest rate exposure by maintaining a conservative debt to equity ratio 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material 
our financing facilities expose our net earnings to changes in short term interest rates because interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
borrowings outstanding under the variable interest bearing financing facilities totaled million at december   and the highest interest rate attributable to this outstanding balance was at december  a change in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material 
we have investment risk exposure arising from our investments in marketable securities due to volatility of the stock market in general  company specific circumstances  and changes in general economic conditions 
as of december   we had million of securities classified as marketable securities 
we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary
