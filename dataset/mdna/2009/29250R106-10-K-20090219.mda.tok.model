competition 
our lakehead system  along with the enbridge system  is the main crude oil export route from the wcsb 
wcsb production in excess of western canadian demand moves on existing pipelines into padd ii  the rocky mountain states padd iv  the anacortes area of washington state padd v  and the us gulf coast padd iii 
in each of these regions  wcsb crude oil competes with local and imported crude oil 
as local crude oil production declines and refineries demand more imported crude oil  imports from the wcsb should increase 
for  the latest data available shows that padd ii total demand was million bpd while it produced only  bpd  and thus imported million bpd 
the data indicates padd ii imported approximately million bpd of crude oil from canada  a majority of which was transported on our lakehead system to destinations in padd ii and to other pipeline systems with padd iii destinations 
the remaining million bpd were imported from padds iii and iv as well as from offshore sources through the us gulf coast 
lakehead system deliveries of canadian crude oil to padd ii were  bpd higher than delivery volumes for total deliveries on our lakehead system averaged million bpd in  meeting approximately percent of minnesota refinery capacity  percent of the greater chicago area  and percent of ontario s refinery demand 
considering all of the pipeline systems that transport western canadian crude oil out of canada  the system transported approximately percent of the total western canadian crude oil exports in to the united states 
the remaining production was transported by systems serving the british columbia  padd ii  padd iv  and padd v markets 
given the expected increase in crude oil production from the alberta oil sands over the next years  alternative transportation proposals have been presented to crude oil producers 
these proposals range from expansions of existing pipelines that currently transport western canadian crude oil  to new pipelines and extensions of existing pipelines 
these proposals are in various stages of development  with some at the concept stage and others that are proceeding with regulatory approval 
some of these proposals could be in direct competition with our lakehead system 
enbridge has proposed construction of the gateway pipeline with an in service date in the to timeframe  which includes both a condensate import pipeline and a petroleum export pipeline 
the condensate line would transport imported diluent from kitimat  british columbia to the edmonton  alberta area 
the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements petroleum export line would transport crude oil from the edmonton area to kitimat and would compete with our lakehead system for production from the alberta oil sands 
we and enbridge believe that the southern access expansion program  the alberta clipper project  and other initiatives to provide access to new markets in the midwest  mid continent and gulf coast  offer flexible solutions to future transportation requirements of western canadian crude oil producers  and the in service timing of these solutions is in line with prospective shipper needs 
the following provides an overview of other proposals put forth by competing pipeline companies that are not affiliated with enbridge the construction of a new inch pipeline alongside an existing pipeline which begins in clearbrook and transports western canadian crude oil to st 
paul  minnesota 
this expansion will have  bpd initial capacity and  bpd ultimate capacity 
construction began in the summer of  and was completed in september while throughput on our lakehead system would benefit from this expansion  volumes moving on our lakehead system could be negatively impacted if the geographic reach of this pipeline were extended by reversing an existing wood river to st 
paul pipeline 
the expansion of an existing pipeline that runs from alberta to british columbia and washington state 
the first phase of this expansion to add  bpd of capacity was approved by the neb in and was completed in the second phase received neb approval in october and was completed in november  adding another  bpd of capacity 
construction of a new  bpd crude oil pipeline from hardisty to wood river and patoka  with a proposed in service date of late in september the neb approved the application to construct and operate a  bpd crude oil pipeline 
in march  the us department of state issued a presidential permit for construction  operation  and maintenance of the pipeline 
a successful open season was held in the early part of for an expansion to  bpd and an extension to cushing 
the project has received  bpd in long term commitments 
in july  the neb approved the  bpd to  bpd expansion 
commercial support has been announced to construct a inch crude oil pipeline extension to this system that will begin at hardisty and extend down to cushing and then to nederland  texas 
the extension will add an additional  bpd of capacity with a targeted in service date of the proposed pipeline extension received  bpd of shipper support in the third quarter of a variety of regulatory approvals will be required in the united states and canada before the proposed extension can proceed 
these competing alternatives for delivering western canadian crude oil into the united states and other markets could erode shipper support for further expansion of our lakehead system beyond the southern access expansion project and the alberta clipper expansion project 
they could also affect throughput on and utilization of the system 
however  our lakehead and enbridge systems offer significant cost savings and flexibility advantages  which are expected to continue to favor the system as the preferred alternative for meeting shipper transportation requirements to the midwest united states and beyond

deliveries thousands of bpd united states light crude oil medium and heavy crude oil ngl total united states ontario light crude oil medium and heavy crude oil ngl total ontario total deliveries barrel miles billions per year mid continent system our mid continent system  which we acquired in the first quarter of  is located within the padd ii district and is comprised of our ozark pipeline  our west tulsa pipeline and storage terminals at cushing and el dorado  kansas 
our mid continent system includes over miles of crude oil pipelines and million barrels of crude oil storage capacity 
our ozark pipeline transports crude oil from cushing to wood river where it delivers to conocophillips wood river refinery and interconnects with the woodpat pipeline  and the wood river pipeline  each owned by unrelated parties 
our west tulsa pipeline moves crude oil from cushing to tulsa  oklahoma where it delivers to sinclair oil corporation s tulsa refinery 
the storage terminals consist of individual storage tanks ranging in size from  to  barrels 
we added a net of seven new tanks during to our existing storage facilities in cushing  which increased our crude oil storage capacity to million barrels 
a portion of the storage facilities are used for operational purposes while for the remainder of the facilities  we contract with various crude oil market participants for their term storage requirements 
contract fees include fixed monthly capacity fees as well as utilization fees  which we charge for injecting crude oil into and withdrawing crude oil from the storage facilities 
customers 
our mid continent system operates under month to month transportation arrangements and both long term and spot storage arrangements with its shippers 
during  approximately shippers tendered crude oil for service by our mid continent system 
we consider multiple companies that are controlled by a common entity to be a single shipper for purposes of determining the number of shippers delivering crude oil and liquid petroleum on our mid continent system 
these customers include integrated oil companies  independent oil producers  refiners and marketers 
average deliveries on the system were  bpd for and  bpd for supply and demand 
our mid continent system is positioned to capitalize on increasing near term demand for imported crude oil from west texas and the us gulf coast as well as third party storage demand 
in  padd ii imported million bpd from outside of the padd ii region 
the data indicate padd ii imported approximately million bpd of crude oil from canada  a majority of which was transported on our lakehead system 
the remaining million bpd of crude oil were imported from padds iii and iv as well as offshore sources 
we expect the gap between local supply and demand for crude oil in padd ii to continue to widen  encouraging imports of crude oil from canada  padd iii  and foreign sources

index to financial statements competition 
our ozark pipeline system currently serves an exclusive corridor between cushing and wood river 
however  refineries connected to wood river have crude supply options available from canada via our lakehead system  with a connection to the mustang pipeline  an enbridge affiliated system and through a third party pipeline  which runs from western canada and padd iv 
these same refineries also have access to the us gulf coast and foreign supply through the capline pipeline system  which is an undivided joint interest pipeline that is owned by unrelated parties 
in addition  refineries located east of patoka with access to crude oil through our ozark system  also have access to west texas supply through the west texas gulf mid valley pipeline systems owned by unrelated parties 
our ozark pipeline system could face a significant increase in competition when a competitor s new pipeline from hardisty to patoka is completed in late however  if that situation occurs  we would consider potential alternative uses for our ozark system 
in addition to movements into wood river  crude oil in cushing is transported to chicago and el dorado on third party pipeline systems 
with the reversal of the spearhead pipeline  western canadian crude oil moving on spearhead is increasing the importance of cushing as a terminal and pipeline origination area 
competition to our west tulsa pipeline increased with the introduction of new capacity into tulsa from cushing by unrelated parties shipping portions of a local refinery s supply through a reactivated pipeline in advance of planned refinery expansion plans 
this new line was created by modifying existing infrastructure 
the storage terminals rely on demand for storage service from numerous oil market participants 
producers  refiners  marketers and traders rely on storage capacity for a number of different reasons batch scheduling  stream quality control  inventory management  and speculative trading opportunities 
competitors to our storage facilities at cushing include large integrated oil companies and other midstream energy partnerships 
north dakota system our north dakota system is a crude oil gathering and interstate transportation system servicing the williston basin in north dakota and montana 
the crude oil gathering pipelines of our north dakota system collect crude oil from points near producing wells in approximately oil fields in north dakota and montana 
most deliveries from our north dakota system are made at clearbrook to our lakehead system and to a third party pipeline system 
our north dakota system includes approximately miles of crude oil gathering lines connected to a transportation line that is approximately miles long  with a capacity of approximately  bpd 
we recently completed a  bpd increase in capacity resulting from the million phase v expansion of the system which we began in and completed in december this expansion was necessary to meet increased crude oil production from the montana and north dakota region 
we have also initiated construction of an approximate million additional expansion to further increase system capacity to  bpd which we refer to as the phase vi expansion 
the commercial structure for this expansion is a cost of service based surcharge that will be added to the existing indexed tariff rates 
the proposed surcharge is similar to the structure being used on the recently completed expansion project and is subject to approval from the ferc 
our north dakota system also has pump stations  one delivery station  and terminaling facilities with an aggregate working storage capacity of approximately  barrels 
customers 
customers of our north dakota system include refiners of crude oil  producers of crude oil and purchasers of crude oil at the wellhead  such as marketers  that require crude oil gathering and transportation services 
producers range in size from small independent owner operators to the largest integrated oil companies 
supply and demand 
similar to our lakehead system  our north dakota system depends upon demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states  and the ability of crude oil producers to maintain their crude oil production and exploration activities 
due to increased exploration of the bakken formation within the williston basin  the north dakota region has seen increased production levels up to  bpd in december competition 
competitors of our north dakota system include integrated oil companies  interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other crude oil gatherers 
many crude oil producers in the oil fields served by our north dakota system have alternative gathering facilities available to them or have the ability to build their own facilities  including some existing rail loading facilities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements natural gas segment we own and operate natural gas gathering  treating  processing and transportation systems as well as trucking  rail and liquids marketing operations 
we purchase and gather natural gas from the wellhead  deliver it to plants for treating and or processing and to intrastate or interstate pipelines for transmission to wholesale customers such as power plants  industrial customers and local distribution companies 
natural gas treating involves the removal of hydrogen sulfide  carbon dioxide  water and other substances from raw natural gas so that it will meet the standards for pipeline transportation 
natural gas processing involves the separation of raw natural gas into residue gas and ngls 
residue gas is the processed natural gas that ultimately is consumed by end users 
ngls separated from the raw natural gas are either sold and transported as ngl raw mix or further separated through a process known as fractionation  and sold as their individual components  including ethane  propane  butanes and natural gasoline 
at december   we have nine active treating plants and active processing plants  including three hydrocarbon dewpoint control facilities  or hcdp plants 
our treating facilities have a combined capacity exceeding  mmcf d while the combined capacity of our processing facilities approximates  mmcf d  including mmcf d provided by the hcdp plants 
our natural gas segment consists of the following systems east texas system includes approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines  eight natural gas treating plants and seven natural gas processing plants  including three hcdp plants and approximately miles of pipeline associated with completed sections of our clarity project 
anadarko system consists of approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines in southwest oklahoma and the texas panhandle and six natural gas processing plants 
the anadarko system includes the palo duro system  which we acquired in march north texas system includes approximately  miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and ten natural gas processing plants located in the fort worth basin 
our transportation operations include three ferc regulated natural gas interstate pipeline systems which include the midla  alatenn and utos pipelines 
each of these natural gas pipeline systems typically consists of a natural gas pipeline  compression  and various interconnects to other pipelines that serve wholesale customers 
effective january   utos was sold to enbridge offshore gas transportation  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of enbridge 
our transportation operations also include a number of smaller non ferc regulated natural gas pipelines and plants as well as trucking operations which are discussed below 
customers 
customers of our natural gas pipeline systems include both purchasers and producers of natural gas 
purchasers are comprised of marketers  including our marketing business  and large users of natural gas  such as power plants  industrial facilities and local distribution companies 
producers served by our systems consist of small  medium and large independent operators and large integrated energy companies 
we sell ngls resulting from our processing activities to a variety of customers ranging from large petrochemical and refining companies to small regional retail propane distributors 
our natural gas pipelines serve customers predominantly in the us gulf coast and southeastern regions of the united states 
customers include large users of natural gas  such as power plants  industrial facilities  local distribution companies  large consumers seeking an alternative to their local distribution company  and shippers of natural gas  such as natural gas producers and marketers 
supply and demand 
demand for our gathering  treating and processing services primarily depends upon the supply of natural gas reserves and the drilling rate of new wells 
the level of impurities in the natural gas gathered also affects treating services 
demand for these services also depends upon overall economic conditions and the prices of natural gas and ngls 
due to the current weak commodity price environment  we expect that near term demand may decrease 
two of our larger systems  east texas and north texas  are located in basins that continue to experience growth in natural gas drilling and production 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our east texas system is primarily located in the east texas basin 
the bossier trend  which is located on the western side of our east texas system within the east texas basin  continues to experience substantial growth 
production in the bossier trend has grown from under mmcf d in to over  mmcf d in november another factor that could lead to more demand on our services is the recent discovery of the haynesville shale in western louisiana and eastern texas 
the haynesville shale has the potential of being the largest natural gas discovery in the united states 
if proven  the discovery could create more drilling activity around our east texas system increasing the demand for our services 
during  a link between our north texas and east texas systems became fully operational and increased the utilization of the mmcf d intrastate pipeline that we placed in service in june on our east texas system by providing additional market access to customers of our north texas system 
in a further effort to address the continuing strong growth in natural gas production occurring in east texas  in early  we initiated a million expansion and extension of our east texas system named the clarity project 
during  we successfully completed the clarity project with the following portions of this expansion project being completed throughout the year the goodrich compressor station was constructed and placed into service in december  a inch segment from orange county  texas to a downstream interconnect near beaumont  texas  enabling deliveries into the interconnect  was placed into service in december  and a inch diameter pipeline segment that extends from kountze  texas to orange county was placed into service in july construction of the orange county compressor station is nearly complete and is expected to be placed into service in late february additional capacity to downstream interconnects will increase as compression continues to be added through mid now that our clarity project has been completed  we will be able to provide service to major industrial companies in southeast texas with interconnects to interstate pipelines  intrastate pipelines and wholesale customers 
the clarity project is designed to be expandable and is positioned for potential upstream and downstream extension to meet the growing demand for natural gas transportation capacity 
we have also completed further expansion of our treating and processing capacity in the region  which began in with the completion of our mmcf d henderson natural gas processing facility 
in may  our expansion of the aker treating plant on our east texas system was completed and placed into service  adding mmcf d of treating capacity 
in the third quarter of  we commenced a million expansion project to add compression at the carthage hub and on the shelby county lateral sections of our east texas system 
as part of the expansion project  we have also initiated construction to increase the capacity of the east texas system in the area by installing approximately miles of inch pipeline 
additional compression capacity will continue to be added until the project s completion in when complete the expansion will provide an additional mmcf d of capacity for this growing region 
the gathering  treating  processing and transportation assets we have placed into service over the past several years on our east texas system are well positioned to capture the growing supply of natural gas being produced in the region 
this is a result of the improved access to primary natural gas markets provided by our clarity project and other expansion projects 
we expect the volumes on our east texas system will increase over the next several years as producers take advantage of new drilling opportunities  including the haynesville shale discovery 
a substantial portion of natural gas on our north texas system is produced in the barnett shale area within the fort worth basin conglomerate 
the fort worth basin conglomerate is a mature zone that is experiencing slow production decline 
in contrast  the barnett shale area is one of the most active natural gas plays in north america 
while abundant natural gas reserves have been known to exist in the barnett shale area since the early s  technological advances in fracturing the shale formation allow commercial production of these natural gas reserves 
based on the latest information available for  barnett shale production has risen from approximately mmcf d in to over  mmcf d in november  with the drilling of over  wells 
we anticipate that throughput on the north texas system will increase modestly in each of the next several 
table of contents 
index to financial statements years as a result of continued barnett shale development 
this is a result of producers balancing the economics of lower commodity prices with the prolific drilling opportunities of the barnett shale 
our anadarko system is located within the anadarko basin and has experienced considerable growth as a result of the rapid development of the granite wash play in hemphill and wheeler counties in texas 
however  we expect the volumes on our anadarko system to decline from historic levels due to weak commodity prices in the midcontinent region of the united states  among other economic factors 
volatility in the capital markets will necessitate a less aggressive capital program in our natural gas business in the near term 
during this period of volatility  we will continue to focus our efforts primarily on the development of our existing pipeline systems 
we have evaluated all of our planned future natural gas projects and have written off projects that were uneconomic 
we have also delayed other projects until such time that capital becomes available at more economical costs for those projects with sufficient commercial support 
we will opportunistically evaluate strategic prospects to further expand the service capabilities of our existing system 
we may also pursue opportunities to divest any non strategic natural gas assets as conditions warrant 
our midla  alatenn and bamagas systems primarily serve industrial corridors and power plants in louisiana  alabama and tennessee 
industries in the area include energy intensive segments of the petrochemical and pulp and paper industries 
we market the unused capacity on these systems under both short term firm and interruptible transportation contracts and long term firm transportation contracts 
these systems are located in areas where opportunities exist to serve new industrial facilities and to make delivery interconnects to alleviate capacity constraints on other third party pipeline systems 
as of december   approximately percent of contracted capacity of the midla system and approximately percent of the alatenn system is under contract to our marketing business 
we completed negotiations with a major customer of our midla mainline transmission system for the renewal of a contract that expired in august for another five year term 
unlike our gathering systems  our interstate pipelines have a concentration of customers 
as such  they are more susceptible to contract loss or competition and potentially the inability to recover the carrying value of their noncurrent assets 
our utos system transports natural gas from offshore platforms on a fee for service basis to other pipelines onshore for further delivery and does not have long term contracts 
the average daily throughput on our utos system during was  mmbtu d 
the ferc approved our negotiated settlement with utos shippers  keeping our current rates in effect under our ferc order through effective january   we sold our utos system to enbridge offshore gas transportation  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of enbridge 
results of our natural gas business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas we serve 
we expect the rapid decline in natural gas and ngl prices during the second half of to reduce exploration and production activity by natural gas producers in the near term  which may diminish the growth rate of our natural gas business 
specifically  we expect the volumes on our anadarko system to decline from historic levels due to weak commodity prices in the midcontinent region of the united states  among other economic factors 
however  our east texas and north texas systems are located in two areas where we believe producers are likely to remain active due to the higher probability of success associated with resource developments in these areas 
we believe the higher success rate in these two areas  coupled with the recent natural gas discovery of the haynesville shale  should temper the impact of lower natural gas production that generally results from a reduction in drilling activity 
competition 
competition from other pipeline companies is significant in all the markets we serve 
competitors of our gathering  treating and processing systems include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that gather  treat  process and market natural gas or ngls 
some of these competitors are substantially larger than we are 
competition for the services we provide varies based upon the location of gathering  treating and processing facilities 
most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering  treating and processing facilities available to them 
in addition  they have alternatives such as building their own gathering facilities or in some cases  selling their natural gas supplies without treating and processing 
in addition to location  competition also varies based upon pricing arrangements and reputation 
on the sour gas systems  such as our east texas system  competition is more limited due to the infrastructure required to treat sour gas 

table of contents 
index to financial statements competition for customers in the marketing of residue gas is based primarily upon the price of the delivered gas  the services offered by the seller and the reliability of the seller in making deliveries 
residue gas also competes on a price basis with alternative fuels such as crude oil and coal  especially for customers that have the capability of using these alternative fuels  and on the basis of local environmental considerations 
competition in the marketing of ngls comes from other ngl marketing companies  producers  traders  chemical companies and other asset owners 
because pipelines are generally the only practical mode of transportation for natural gas over land  the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipelines 
pipelines typically compete with each other based on location  capacity  price and reliability 
many of the large wholesale customers we serve have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities 
accordingly  many of these customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines or third parties that may hold capacity on the various pipelines 
in addition  a number of new interstate natural gas pipelines are being constructed in areas currently served by some of our intrastate and interstate pipelines 
when completed  these new pipelines may compete for customers with our existing pipelines 
trucking and liquids marketing operations we also include our trucking and liquids marketing operations in our natural gas segment 
these operations include the transportation of ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide by truck and railcar from wellheads and treating  processing and fractionation facilities and to wholesale customers  such as distributors  refiners and chemical facilities 
in addition  our trucking and liquids marketing operations resell these products 
a key component of our business is ensuring market access for the liquids extracted at our processing facilities 
on average  this accounts for approximately percent of the volume transported by our trucking and liquids marketing business and is a major source of its growth in this area 
our services are provided using trucks  trailers and rail cars  product treating and handling equipment and ngl storage facilities 
in  we acquired the assets of a common carrier trucking company for million to meet the growing supply of ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide from our processing facilities  as well as to capitalize on the opportunity to better serve our us gulf coast customers 
this acquisition doubled the size of our truck fleet 
customers 
most of the customers of our trucking and liquids marketing operations are wholesale customers  such as refineries and propane distributors 
our trucking and liquids marketing operations also market products to wholesale customers such as petrochemical plants 
supply and demand 
supply is sourced from a variety of areas in the us gulf coast  with a significant amount of the ngl volume coming from our own gathering and processing facilities 
crude oil and natural gas prices and production levels affect the supply of these products 
the demand for our services is affected by the demand for ngls and crude oil by large industrial refineries  and similar customers in the regions served by this business 
competition 
our trucking and liquids marketing operations have a number of competitors  including other trucking and railcar operations  pipelines  and  to a lesser extent  marine transportation and alternative fuels 
in addition  the marketing activities of our trucking and liquids marketing operations have numerous competitors  including marketers of all types and sizes  affiliates of pipelines and independent aggregators 
marketing segment our marketing segment s primary objectives are to mitigate financial risk and maximize the value of the natural gas purchased by our gathering systems and the throughput on our gathering and intrastate wholesale customer pipelines 
to achieve this objective  our marketing segment transacts with various counterparties to provide natural gas supply  transportation  balancing  storage and sales services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements since our gathering and intrastate wholesale customer pipeline assets are geographically located within texas  oklahoma  alabama  mississippi and louisiana  the majority of activities conducted by our marketing segment are focused within these areas 
customers 
natural gas purchased by our marketing segment is sold to industrial  utility and power plant end use customers 
in addition  gas is sold to marketing companies at various market hubs 
these sales are typically priced based upon a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to end use customers incorporate a pass through charge for costs of transportation and additional margin to compensate us for associated services 
supply and demand 
supply for our marketing business depends to a large extent on the natural gas reserves and rate of drilling within the areas served by our natural gas segment 
demand is typically driven by weather related factors with respect to power plant and utility customers and industrial demand 
our marketing business uses third party storage capacity to balance supply and demand factors within its portfolio 
marketing pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage  or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts  and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
due to the increased volumes from our gathering assets  our marketing business leases third party pipeline capacity downstream from our natural gas assets under firm transportation contracts 
this capacity is leased for various lengths of time and at rates that allow our marketing business to diversify its customer base by expanding its service territory 
additionally  this transportation capacity provides assurance that our natural gas will not be shut in  which can result from capacity constraints on downstream pipelines 
competition 
our marketing segment has numerous competitors  including large natural gas marketing companies  marketing affiliates of pipelines  major oil and gas producers  independent aggregators and regional marketing companies 
regulation ferc allowance for income taxes in interstate common carrier pipeline rates in december  the ferc released its first case specific review of the income tax allowance issue reaffirming its income tax allowance policy and directing the pipeline to provide certain evidence necessary to determine its income tax allowance 
the ferc s bp west coast remand decision and the new tax allowance policy were appealed to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  or the dc circuit court 
in may  the dc circuit court upheld the income tax allowance policy adopted by the ferc for master limited partnerships mlps and other non taxable entities 
on the basis of the santa fe pacific pipeline  lp sfpp order  the lp circuit court concluded that the ferc s new policy statement applied to sfpp and resolved the principal defect of the lakehead policy  which was the inadequately explained differential treatment of the tax liability of the individual and corporate partners 
on that basis  the dc circuit court affirmed the ferc s tax allowance policy as being reasonable and in accordance with the ferc s statutory discretion 
as such  the dc circuit court affirmed that an allowance should be permitted on all partnership interests  or similar legal interest  if the owner of that interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on the public utility income earned though the interest 
we believe that all applicable assets will be entitled to a tax allowance to the extent a pipeline s partners have income tax liability on the income they receive from the pipeline 
in august  the dc circuit court denied a request for rehearing of its may decision  and the decision is now final and cannot be appealed 
ferc return on equity policy for oil pipelines on april   the ferc issued a policy statement regarding the inclusion of mlps in the proxy groups used to determine the return on equity roe for oil pipelines 
composition of proxy groups for determining gas and oil pipeline return on equity  ferc   rehearing denied  ferc 
table of contents 
index to financial statements  
no petitions for review of the policy statement were filed with the dc circuit court 
the policy statement largely upheld the prior method by which roes were calculated for oil pipelines  explaining that mlps should continue to be included in the roe proxy group for oil pipelines  and that there should be no ceiling on the level of distributions included in the ferc s current discounted cash flow dcf methodology 
the policy statement further indicated that the institutional brokers estimated system ibes forecasts should remain the basis for the short term growth forecast used in the dcf calculation and there should be no modification to the current respective two thirds and one third weightings of the short and long term growth factors 
the primary change to the prior roe methodology was the policy statement s holding that the gross domestic product gdp forecast used for the long term growth rate should be reduced by percent for all mlps included in the proxy group 
everything else being equal  that change will result in somewhat lower roes for oil pipelines than would have been calculated under the prior roe methodology 
the actual roes to be calculated under the new policy statement  however  are dependent on the companies included in the proxy group and the specific conditions existing at the time the roe is calculated in each case 
accounting for pipeline assessment costs in june  the ferc issued an order in docket ai describing how ferc regulated companies should account for costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the united states department of transportation s office of pipeline safety 
the order took effect on january  under the order  ferc regulated companies are generally required to recognize costs incurred in performing pipeline assessments that are part of a pipeline integrity management program as maintenance expense in the period in which the costs are incurred 
costs for items such as rehabilitation projects designed to extend the useful life of the system can continue to be capitalized to the extent permitted under the existing rules 
the ferc denied rehearing of its accounting guidance order on september  we have historically capitalized first time in line inspection programs  based on previous rulings by the ferc 
in january  we began expensing all first time internal inspection costs for all our pipeline systems  whether or not they are subject to the ferc s regulation  on a prospective basis 
we will continue to expense secondary internal inspection tests consistent with the previous practice

regulation by the ferc of interstate common carrier liquids pipelines our lakehead  north dakota  and ozark systems are our primary interstate common carrier liquids pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica 
as common carriers in interstate commerce  these pipelines provide service to any shipper who requests transportation services  provided that products tendered for transportation satisfy the conditions and specifications contained in the applicable tariff 
the ica requires us to maintain tariffs on file with the ferc that set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines  as well as the rules and regulations governing these services 
the ica gives the ferc the authority to regulate the rates we can charge for service on interstate common carrier pipelines 
the ica requires  among other things  that such rates be just and reasonable as well as nondiscriminatory 
the ica permits interested parties to challenge newly proposed or changed rates  and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate the rates to determine if they are just and reasonable 
if the ferc finds the new or changed rate unlawful  it is authorized to require the carrier to refund  with interest  the increased revenues in excess of the amount that would have been collected during the term of the investigation at the rate properly determined to be lawful 
the ferc also may investigate  upon complaint  or on its own motion  rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively 
upon an appropriate showing  a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint 
in october  congress passed the energy policy act of ep act  which deemed petroleum pipeline rates that were in effect for the day period ending on the date of enactment  or that were in effect on 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint  protest or investigation during the day period  to be just and reasonable under the ica ie  grandfathered 
the ep act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates 
in order to challenge grandfathered rates  a party must show  that it was contractually barred from challenging the rates during the relevant day period  that there has been a substantial change after the date of enactment of the ep act in the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services that were the basis for the rate  or that the rate is unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential 
the ferc determined our lakehead system rates are not covered by the grandfathering provisions of the ep act because they were subject to challenge prior to the effective date of the statute 
we believe that the rates for our north dakota and ozark systems should be found to be covered by the grandfathering provisions of the ep act 
the ep act required the ferc to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for petroleum pipelines  and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings 
the ferc responded to this mandate by issuing order no 
adopted an indexing rate methodology for petroleum pipelines 
under these regulations  which became effective january   petroleum pipelines are able to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index 
rate increases made within the ceiling levels may be protested  but such protests must show that the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline s increase in costs 
if the indexing methodology results in a reduced ceiling level that is lower than a pipeline s filed rate  order no 
requires the pipeline to reduce its rate to comply with the lower ceiling  although a pipeline is not required to reduce its rate below the level grandfathered under the ep act 
under order no 
 a pipeline must utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates 
the ferc  however  uses cost of service ratemaking  market based rates  and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach in certain specified circumstances 
under order no 
 the original inflation index adopted by the ferc was equal to the annual change in the producer price index for finished goods  or ppi fg  minus one percentage point 
the index was subject to review every five years 
rates were then subject to an annual adjustment  based upon changes in the ppi fg minus  in order to accurately reflect the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry 
in december  as part of the ferc s five year review of the oil pricing index july through june  the ferc concluded that the ppi fg accurately reflected the actual cost changes experienced by the industry 
in february  the ferc issued an order on remand  concluding that for the current five year period  the oil pricing index should be the ppi fg 
in order to calculate the ceiling rate levels  oil pipelines were permitted to use the ppi fg adjustment as though it had been in effect since as of july   the index was equal to ppi fg plus percentage points  resulting in an index of for the period of july  through june  regulation by the ferc of interstate natural gas pipelines our alatenn  midla and utos systems are interstate natural gas pipelines regulated by the ferc under the natural gas act  or nga  and the natural gas policy act  or ngpa 
each system operates under separate ferc approved tariffs that establish rates  terms and conditions under which each system provides service to its customers 
rates charged by natural gas companies must be determined by the ferc to be just and reasonable 
in addition  the ferc s authority over natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce includes certification and construction of new facilities  extension or abandonment of services and facilities  maintenance of accounts and records  acquisition and disposition of facilities  initiation and discontinuation of services  terms and conditions of services and service contracts with customers

index to financial statements depreciation and amortization policies  conduct and relationship with certain affiliates  and various other matters 
the maximum recourse rates that may be charged by our pipelines for their services are established through the ferc s ratemaking process 
generally  the maximum filed recourse rates for interstate pipelines are based on the cost of service  including recovery of and a return on the pipeline s actual prudent historical cost investment 
key determinants in the ratemaking process are costs of providing service  allowed rate of return and volume throughput and contractual capacity commitment assumptions 
the maximum applicable recourse rates and terms and conditions for service are set forth in each pipeline s ferc approved tariff 
rate design and the allocation of costs also can impact a pipeline s profitability 
our interstate pipelines are permitted to discount their firm and interruptible rates without further ferc authorization down to the variable cost of performing service  provided they do not unduly discriminate 
tariff changes can only be implemented upon approval by the ferc 
two primary methods are available for changing the rates  terms and conditions of service of an interstate natural gas pipeline 
under the first method  the pipeline voluntarily seeks a tariff change by making a tariff filing with the ferc justifying the proposed tariff change and providing notice  generally days  to the appropriate parties 
if the ferc determines that a proposed change is just and reasonable as required by the nga  the ferc will accept the proposed change and the pipeline will implement such change in its tariff 
however  if the ferc determines that a proposed change may not be just and reasonable as required by the nga  then the ferc may suspend such change for up to five months beyond the date on which the change would otherwise go into effect and set the matter for an administrative hearing 
subsequent to any suspension period ordered by the ferc  the proposed change may be placed into effect by the company  pending final ferc approval 
in most cases  a proposed rate increase is placed into effect before a final ferc determination on such rate increase  and the proposed increase is collected subject to refund plus interest 
under the second method  the ferc may  on its own motion or based on a complaint  initiate a proceeding seeking to compel the company to change its rates  terms and or conditions of service 
if the ferc determines that the existing rates  terms and or conditions of service are unjust  unreasonable  unduly discriminatory or preferential  then any rate reduction or change that it orders generally will be effective prospectively from the date of the ferc order requiring this change 
on december   the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which proposes to require interstate natural gas pipelines and certain non interstate natural gas pipelines to post capacity  daily scheduled flow information  and daily actual flow information 
on november   ferc issued order  which requires interstate pipelines to post information concerning daily actual flows of no notice service  commencing january  order also requires non interstate pipelines that deliver more than million mmbtu per year to post daily on an internet website and in ferc prescribed formats certain information concerning receipt and delivery point capacity and scheduled volumes 
this requirement is effective days following the ferc issuance of an order on the pending requests for rehearing 
because requests for rehearing are pending  the final rules remain subject to change 
adoption of this proposal by the ferc will result in additional administrative burdens and will likely result in increased capital costs 
in addition  on november   the ferc issued a notice of inquiry noi seeking comment on whether it should impose additional reporting requirements on intrastate pipelines providing service under section of the ngpa  such as our east texas system 
in particular  the ferc seeks comment on whether it should require such pipelines to post the details of their transactions with shippers in a manner more comparable to the requirements applicable to interstate pipelines 
ferc has not yet taken any further action on this noi  and we cannot at this stage predict what  if any  additional reporting requirements may be adopted 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated  therefore  there is no assurance that a more stringent regulatory approach will not be pursued by the ferc and congress  especially in light of potential market power abuse by marketing affiliates of certain pipeline companies engaged in interstate commerce 
in response to this issue  congress  in the energy policy act of epact 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and the ferc have implemented requirements to ensure that energy prices are not impacted by the exercise of market power or manipulative conduct 
epact prohibits the use of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas  electric energy or transportation subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
the ferc then adopted the market manipulation rules and the market behavior rules to implement the authority granted under epact these rules  which prohibit fraud and manipulation in wholesale energy markets  are very vague and subject to broad interpretation 
only two orders interpreting these rules have been issued to date  and each of these is subject to further proceedings 
these orders reflect the ferc s view that it has broad latitude in determining whether specific behavior violates the rules 
in addition  epact gave the ferc increased penalty authority for these violations 
the ferc may now issue civil penalties of up to million per day for each violation of the ferc s rules  and there are possible criminal penalties of up to million and years in prison 
given the ferc s broad mandate granted in epact  it is assumed that  if energy prices are high or exhibit what the ferc deems to be unusual trading patterns  the ferc will investigate energy markets to determine if behavior unduly impacted or manipulated energy prices 
also  in december   the ferc issued new rules order requiring that any market participant  including intrastate pipelines and marketers  such as enbridge marketing us lp  that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed million mmbtus during a calendar year  must annually report  starting may   such sales and purchases to the ferc 
these rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the ferc in monitoring such markets and detecting market manipulation 
the ferc issued an order on rehearing of these rules on september   which largely retained the existing rules  except that the ferc exempted certain types of purchases and sales  such as those involving unprocessed gas and bundled retail sales pursuant to state regulated tariffs  and clarified that other end use purchases and sales are not exempt from the reporting requirements 
adoption of these rules will result in increased administrative burdens and may also increase capital costs 
other than the market manipulation and transparency rules described above  our texas intrastate pipelines are generally not subject to regulation by the ferc 
however  to the extent our intrastate pipelines transport natural gas in interstate commerce  the rates  terms and conditions of such transportation are subject to ferc jurisdiction under section of the natural gas policy act ngpa 
in addition  some of our operations are subject to regulation under the texas utilities code  as implemented by the texas railroad commission trrc 
generally  the trrc is vested with authority to ensure that rates charged for natural gas sales and transportation services are just and reasonable 
the rates we charge for transportation services are deemed just and reasonable under texas law  unless challenged in a complaint 
we cannot predict whether such a complaint may be filed against us or whether the trrc will change its method of regulating rates 
during the legislative session  the texas state legislature passed hb competition bill and hb lug bill 
the competition bill gives the trrc the ability to use either a cost of service method or a market based method for setting rates for natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation pipelines in formal rate proceedings 
the competition bill also gives the trrc specific authority to enforce its statutory duty to prevent discrimination in natural gas gathering and transportation  to enforce the requirement that parties participate in an informal complaint process and to punish purchasers  transporters  and gatherers for taking discriminatory actions against shippers and sellers 
the competition bill also provides producers with the unilateral option to determine whether or not confidentiality provisions are included in a contract to which a producer is a party for the sale  transportation  or gathering of natural gas 
the lug bill modifies the informal complaint process at the trrc with procedures unique to lost and unaccounted for gas issues 
the lug bill also extends the types of information that can be requested  provides producers with an annual audit right  and provides the trrc with the authority to make determinations and issue orders in specific situations 
both the competition bill and the lug bill became effective september  proposals are pending in the session of the texas legislature which  if enacted  could give the trrc or other governmental authorities greater authority over the siting and operation of intrastate pipelines and appurtenant facilities 
we cannot predict whether or not this  or other legislation affecting intrastate pipeline operations  may be enacted during such legislative session  and if so  how any such new legislation might affect 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our operations 
we do not anticipate our operations would be affected differently from those of other intrastate pipeline and gathering companies 
intrastate pipeline regulation our intrastate liquids and natural gas pipeline operations are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located 
various state agencies possess the authority to review and authorize natural gas transportation transactions and the construction  acquisition  abandonment and interconnection of physical facilities 
additionally  some state agencies have the authority to regulate transportation rates  service terms and conditions  and contract pricing to ensure their reasonableness and to ensure that the intrastate pipeline companies do not discriminate amongst similarly situated customers 
enbridge s intrastate pipeline operations are also subject to limited regulation by the ferc under section of the ngpa  ie  to the extent such operations include the delivery of natural gas into interstate commerce  and under section of the nga  which the us congress added to the nga by the epact under section of the ngpa  an intrastate natural gas pipeline may make deliveries into interstate commerce subject to the ferc s jurisdiction over the rates  terms and conditions of such transportation services 
additionally  on september   the ferc issued order no 
 which requires that all tariffs  tariff revisions and rate change applications be filed electronically according to a set of standards that are applicable to all such documents  including statements of operating conditions and rate applications filed pursuant to section although regulatory guidance regarding the exact requirements of order no 
has been less than definite  enbridge is proceeding in a prudent manner and reasonably foresees complete and timely compliance with all order no 
requirements 
under section of the nga  the ferc recently promulgated new rules  orders no 
a and no 
 to facilitate one of the stated goals of epact  ie  to enhance the transparency of the ie natural gas market 
order no 
a  issued september   mandates the annual report of transactional information by wholesale natural gas buyers and sellers who buy or sell greater than million mmbtu in a reporting year 
because our gathering and processing operations frequently include natural gas purchases and sales  the annual sum of which are likely to be greater than million mmbtu  we anticipate being subject to this reporting requirement every year on an on going basis 
order no 
 issued november   requires major non interstate pipelines defined as pipelines that deliver more than million mmbtu per year to post on their internet websites information regarding the daily scheduled volume and design capacity for certain receipt and delivery points 
enbridge considers it prudent to duly comply with the order until such time as it may be vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction and is  therefore  making preparations to do all internet postings as required 
notwithstanding that the ferc s newly adopted orders no 
 no 
a  and no 
increase certain of our administrative obligations  enbridge believes that these regulatory changes will have little or no adverse impact on our day to day operations 
natural gas gathering pipeline regulation section b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga 
we own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction 
however  as noted in intrastate pipeline regulation  above  to the extent our gathering systems buy and sell natural gas  such gatherers  in their capacity as buyers and sellers of natural gas  will be subject to ferc order a 
additionally  if one of our gathering systems were to fall under the definition of major non interstate pipeline  such gatherer would be subject to ferc order no 
 as described in intrastate pipeline regulation above  subject to a court ruling otherwise 
state regulations of gathering facilities typically address the safety and environmental concerns involved in the design  construction  installation  testing and operation of gathering facilities  as well as  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements  but historically has not entailed rate regulation 
in  the ferc initiated an inquiry regarding the extent to which gathering systems both offshore and onshore  particularly those that had been previously transferred from a regulated entity  should be regulated by the ferc 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the ferc terminated this inquiry in early without making any finding that would expand its existing regulatory purview over gathering facilities 
further  some states have  or are considering providing  greater regulatory scrutiny over the commercial regulation of the natural gas gathering business 
many of the producing states have previously adopted some form of complaint based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access or perceived rate discrimination 
our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to significant and unduly burdensome state or federal regulation of rates and services 
sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids the price at which we sell natural gas currently is not subject to federal or state regulation except for certain systems in texas 
our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability  terms and cost of pipeline transportation 
as noted above  the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry  most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies that remain subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
these initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances 
the stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry 
on december   the ferc issued order no 
 a final rule which adopted new regulations designed to facilitate price transparency in markets for the wholesale sale of physical natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the ferc s authority under section of the natural gas act 
the regulations adopted in order no 
require most natural gas market participants to file form no 
 a new annual report on wholesale  physical natural gas sales and purchases during the previous calendar year 
on september   the ferc issued order no 
a  an order on rehearing and clarification of order no 
in order no 
a  ferc largely affirmed the basic determinations reached in order no 
and also granted rehearing in part and clarification of certain aspects of order no 
our sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids currently are not regulated and are made at market prices 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to the ferc s jurisdiction under the ica 
certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could increase the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other marketers of these products 
other regulation the governments of the united states and canada have  by treaty  agreed to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment for the passage of oil and natural gas through the pipelines of one country across the territory of the other 
individual border crossing points require us government permits that may be terminated or amended at the will of the us government 
these permits provide that pipelines may be inspected by or subject to orders issued by federal or state government agencies

lakehead periodically adjusts transportation rates as allowed under the ferc s indexing methodology and the tariff agreements described below base rates the base portion of the transportation rates for our lakehead system are subject to an annual adjustment  which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the ferc  and are determined in compliance with the ferc approved indexing methodology 
sep ii surcharge under the settlement agreement with capp that the ferc approved in and reconfirmed in  lakehead implemented a transportation rate surcharge related to the sep ii project 
this surcharge  which is added to the base transportation rates  is a cost of service based calculation that is trued up annually usually in april for actual costs and throughput from the previous calendar year  and is not subject to indexing 
the initial term of the sep ii portion of the settlement agreement was for years  beginning in terrace surcharge under the tariff agreement approved by the ferc in  lakehead also implemented a transportation rate surcharge for the terrace expansion program of approximately per barrel for light crude oil from the canadian border to chicago 
on april   pursuant to an agreement between lakehead and enbridge pipelines inc  lakehead s share of the surcharge was increased to per barrel 
this surcharge was in effect until april   when lakehead s share of the surcharge changed to per barrel 
lakehead s share will remain at this level until  at which time the surcharge will return to per barrel through  when the agreement expires 
in addition to the terrace surcharge  included in the tariff is the terrace schedule c adjustment 
under the tariff agreement  when terrace phase iii facilities are in service and annual actual average pumping exiting clearbrook is less than  m per day  an adjustment is made to the terrace surcharge 
in  this adjustment was per barrel  based on annual actual average pumping exiting clearbrook of  m per day in facilities surcharge on july   the ferc approved a settlement with capp involving a facilities surcharge mechanism fsm  which allows for recovery of costs for enhancements or modifications to the system at shipper request and approved by capp

the ferc approved the offer of settlement on march   which sought approval for the sa expansion surcharge under the provisions of the previously approved fsm 
the sa expansion involves the construction of a new inch diameter pipeline between superior and flanagan  along with associated upstream modifications to balance the expanded capacity created by the new superior to flanagan line

on both sides of the border  the system will initially be able to transport an additional  bpd with the potential for expansion up to  bpd 
the us portion of the project includes approximately miles of new inch pipeline between the international border near neche and superior  along with three new pump stations at existing pump locations and five  barrel breakout tanks at superior 
the estimated cost of the us portion to be recovered through the fsm is approximately billion in us dollars 
ferc approved the settlement by letter dated august  and construction on the us side will begin in june the entire project is to be completed and placed in service in the first six months of mid continent system ozark our mid continent system is comprised of pipeline  terminaling  and storage infrastructure located in the mid continent region of the united states 
specifically  the system originates in cushing and offers transportation service to wood river  west tulsa  other mid continent system facilities  local area refineries  and other interconnected non affiliated pipelines 
transportation rates for light crude oil from cushing to principle delivery points are set forth below published transportation rate per barrel to wood river  illinois to west tulsa  oklahoma the transportation rates as of december   outlined above  apply to light crude only 
medium and heavy crude oil transportation rates on these systems are higher to compensate for differences in the costs of shipping different types and grades of liquid hydrocarbons 
in addition to the routes above  our mid continent system also has the following two joint tariffs one with all american pipeline  lp  which allows for transportation from points in texas and jal  new mexico  to wood river  and another with koch pipeline company  lp  which allows for transportation from cushing to hartford tankage  illinois

table of contents 
index to financial statements other factors 
competitive forces may prompt us to charge tariff rates below the ferc approved maximum rate on our interstate systems 
the rates charged for transmission of natural gas on pipelines not regulated by the ferc  or a state agency  are established by competitive forces 
safety regulation and environmental general our transmission and gathering pipelines and storage and processing facilities are subject to extensive federal and state environmental  operational and safety regulation 
the added costs imposed by regulations are generally no different than those imposed on our competitors 
the failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties and or enforcement actions and added operational costs 
pipeline safety and transportation regulation our transmission and non rural gathering pipelines are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation  or dot  pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa under title united states code of federal regulations pipeline safety act  or psa relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of transmission and non rural gathering pipeline facilities 
the phmsa is the agency charged with regulating the safe transportation of hazardous materials under all modes of transportation  including intrastate pipelines 
periodically the psa has been reauthorized and amended  imposing new mandates on the regulator to promulgate new regulations  imposing direct mandates on operators of pipelines 
in phmsa published a final rule regarding the qualification of pipeline operations personnel 
the operator qualification regulations require pipeline operators to utilize qualified individuals to perform pipeline operations and maintenance activities or tasks 
the rule required pipeline operators to have a written plan in place by april  and to complete qualification of personnel by october  we have prepared an operator qualification plan which is in compliance with the final rule 
the implementation of this plan does not have a material affect on the operations of our pipelines 
on december   the psi act of was enacted reauthorizing and amending the psa 
the most significant amendment required natural gas pipelines to develop integrity management programs and conduct integrity assessment tests at a minimum of seven year intervals 
such tests can include internal inspection  hydrostatic pressure tests or direct assessments on pipelines in certain high consequence areas 
the phmsa has since promulgated rules for this and other mandates included in the psi act of on december   the pipeline inspection  protection  enforcement  and safety act of pipes of was enacted  which further amended the pipeline safety act 
many of the provisions were welcome  including strengthening excavation damage prevention and enforcement 
the most significant provisions of pipes of that will affect us  but not materially  include a mandate to phmsa to remove most exemptions from federal regulations for liquid pipelines operating at low stress and mandates phmsa to undertake rulemaking requiring pipeline operators to have a human factors management plan for pipeline control room personnel  including consideration for controlling hours of service 
we have incorporated the new requirements of the and psa amendments into procedures and budgets and  while we expect to incur higher regulatory compliance costs  the increase is not expected to be material 
the pipeline safety act reauthorization of pipes act required  among other measures  for phmsa to extend their current jurisdictional authority to regulate previously exempted low operating stress pipelines 
in september  the phmsa issued a nopr that details how such low stress pipelines would be regulated and the safety measures that would be required 
industry commented and phmsa issued the final rule on june  the final rule does not have any regulatory requirements that materially affect our low stress transmission pipelines 

table of contents 
index to financial statements when hydrocarbons are released into the environment  the phmsa can impose a return to service plan  which can include implementing certain internal inspections  pipeline pressure reductions  and other strategies to verify the integrity of the pipeline in the affected area 
we do not anticipate any return to service plans that will have a material impact on system throughput or compliance costs  however  we have the potential of incurring expenditures to remediate any condition in the event of a discharge or failure on our systems 
our trucking and railcar operations are also subject to safety and permitting regulation by the dot and state agencies with regard to the safe transportation of hazardous and other materials 
we believe that our pipeline  trucking and railcar operations are in substantial compliance with applicable operational and safety requirements 
in instances of non compliance  we have taken actions to remediate the situations 
nevertheless  significant expenses could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the capabilities of our current pipeline control system or other safety equipment 
environmental regulation general 
our operations are subject to complex federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment  including laws and regulations which govern the handling  storage and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials or emissions from natural gas compression facilities 
as with the pipeline and processing industry in general  complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain  and upgrade equipment and facilities 
while these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income  we believe that they do not affect our competitive position since the operations of our competitors are generally similarly affected 
in addition to compliance costs  violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal fines and penalties and  in some instances  injunctions banning or delaying certain activities 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
there are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations  such as leaks or spills of crude oil  liquids or natural gas or other substances from our pipelines or storage facilities 
such accidental releases could  to the extent not insured  subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage  and fines  penalties  or damages for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
although we are entitled  in certain circumstances  to indemnification from third parties for environmental liabilities relating to assets we acquired from those parties  these contractual indemnification rights are limited and  accordingly  we may be required to bear substantial environmental expenses 
however  we believe that through our due diligence process  we identify and manage substantial issues 
air and water emissions 
our operations are subject to the federal clean air act  or caa  and the federal clean water act  or cwa  and comparable state and local statutes 
we anticipate  therefore  that we will incur certain capital expenses in the next several years for air pollution control equipment and spill prevention measures in connection with maintaining existing facilities and obtaining permits and approvals for any new or acquired facilities 
the oil pollution act opa was enacted in and amends parts of the cwa and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to oil spills 
under the opa  we could be subject to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill from our facilities into navigable waters  along shorelines or in an exclusive economic zone of the united states 
the opa also imposes certain spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements for many of our non pipeline facilities  such as the preparation of detailed oil spill emergency response plans and the construction of dikes or other containment structures to prevent contamination of navigable or other waters in the event of an oil overflow  rupture or leak 
for our liquid pipeline facilities  the opa imposes requirements for emergency plans to be prepared  submitted 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and approved by the dot 
for our non transportation facilities  such as storage tanks that are not integral to pipeline transportation system  the opa regulations are promulgated by the environmental protection agency  or epa 
we believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations 
hazardous substances and waste management 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla also known as the superfund law  and similar state laws  impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons  including the owners or operators of waste disposal sites and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
we may generate some wastes that fall within the definition of a hazardous substance 
we may  therefore  be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of any costs required to clean up and restore sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
analogous state laws may apply to a broader range of substances than cercla and  in some instances  may offer fewer exemptions from liability 
we have not received any notification that we may be potentially responsible for material cleanup costs under cercla or similar state laws 
employee health and safety 
the workplaces associated with our operations are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health administration  or osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate worker health and safety 
we have an ongoing safety  procedure and training program for our employees and believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable osha requirements  including industry consensus standards  record keeping requirements  monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances  and hazard communication standards 
site remediation 
we own and operate a number of pipelines  gathering systems  storage facilities and processing facilities that have been used to transport  distribute  store and process crude oil  natural gas and other petroleum products 
many of our facilities were previously owned and operated by third parties whose handling  disposal and release of petroleum and waste materials were not under our control 
the age of the facilities  combined with the past operating and waste disposal practices  which were standard for the industry and regulatory regime at the time  have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some facilities due to historical spills and releases 
such contamination is not unusual within the natural gas and petroleum industry 
historical contamination found on  under or originating from our properties may be subject to cercla  resource conservation recovery act and analogous state laws as described above 
under these laws  we could incur substantial expense to remediate such contamination  including contamination caused by prior owners and operators 
in addition  enbridge management  as the entity with managerial responsibility for us  could also be liable for such costs to the extent that we are unable to fulfill our obligations 
we have conducted site investigations at some of our facilities to assess historical environmental issues  and we are currently addressing soil and groundwater contamination at various facilities through remediation and monitoring programs  with oversight by the applicable government agencies where appropriate 
employees neither we nor enbridge management have any employees 
our general partner has delegated to enbridge management  pursuant to a delegation of control agreement  substantially all of the responsibility for our day to day management and operation 
our general partner  however  retains certain functions and approval rights over our operations 
to fulfill its management obligations  enbridge management has entered into agreements with enbridge and several of its affiliates to provide enbridge management with the necessary services and support personnel who act on enbridge management s behalf as its agents 
we are ultimately responsible for reimbursing these service providers based on the costs that they incur in performing these services

risk factors we encourage you to read the risk factors below in connection with the other sections of this annual report on form k 
risks related to our business our actual construction and development costs could exceed our forecast and our cash flow from construction and development projects may not be immediate  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase cash distributions 
our strategy contemplates significant expenditures for the development  construction or other acquisition of energy infrastructure assets 
increased demand for the steel used to fabricate the pipe needed for our construction projects and increased competition for labor has resulted in increased costs for these resources 
additionally  the construction of new assets involves numerous regulatory  environmental  legal  political and operational risks that are difficult to predict and beyond our control 
as a result  we may not be able to complete our projects at the costs currently estimated or within the time periods we have projected 
if we experience material cost overruns  we will have to finance these overruns using one or more of the following methods using cash from operations  delaying other planned projects  incurring additional indebtedness  or issuing additional equity 
any or all of these methods may not be available when needed or may adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows 
our revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately on our expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for example  if we build a new pipeline or expand an existing facility  the design  construction  development and installation may occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increase in revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service and customers begin using the systems 
if our revenues and cash flow do not increase at projected levels because of substantial unanticipated delays  or other factors  we may not meet our obligations as they become due and we may need to reduce or reprioritize our capital budget  sell non strategic assets  access the capital markets or reassess our level of distributions to unitholders to meet our capital requirements 
our ability to access the credit and capital markets on attractive terms to obtain funding for our capital projects may be limited due to the deterioration of these markets 
we expect to make significant expenditures for the construction of additional crude oil transportation infrastructure over the next two years 
our ability to fund these expenditures is dependent on our ability to access the capital necessary to finance the construction of these facilities 
domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  weak and volatile and have contributed significantly to a substantial deterioration in the credit and capital markets 
these conditions  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector and the re pricing of credit risks have made  and likely will continue to make  it difficult to obtain funding for our capital needs from the credit and capital markets on terms similar to our recent capital raising transactions 
as a result  we may revise the timing and scope of these projects as necessary to adapt to existing markets and economic conditions 
in particular  the cost of raising funds in the debt and equity capital markets has increased while the availability of funds from those markets has diminished 
also  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining funds from the credit markets has increased as many lenders have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards and reduced  and in some cases ceased to provide  funding to borrowers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements due to the recent downturn in the financial markets  including the issues surrounding the solvency of many financial institutions and the recent failure  combinations and announced combinations of several financial institutions  our ability to obtain capital from our credit facility may be impaired 
for example  since lehman brothers holdings inc lehman filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  lehman brothers bank fsb lehman bb  a subsidiary of lehman and a committed lender under our credit facility  has declined requests to honor its commitment to lend up to million under our credit facility  effectively reducing the amount available to us under our credit facility to  million 
we may be unable to use the full borrowing capacity under our credit facility if other lenders do not replace lehman bb s funding commitment under the credit facility or if any of the remaining committed lenders is unable or unwilling to fund its portion of any funding request we make under our credit facility 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding for our capital needs will be available from the credit and capital markets if needed and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to implement our development plan  enhance our existing business  complete acquisitions and construction projects  otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
a downgrade in our credit rating could require us to provide collateral for our hedging liabilities and negatively impact our borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s rate our non credit enhanced  senior unsecured debt at bbb with a negative outlook and baa with a negative outlook  respectively 
although we are not aware of any current plans by s p or moody s to lower their respective ratings on such debt  we cannot be assured that such credit ratings will not be downgraded 
currently  we are parties to certain international swap and derivative association  inc  or isda  agreements associated with the derivative financial instruments we use to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices 
these isda agreements require us to provide assurances of performance if our counterparties exposure to us exceeds certain levels or thresholds 
we generally provide letters of credit to satisfy such requirements 
at december   we were not required to provide any assurances of performance for our then outstanding derivative financial instruments 
if our credit ratings had declined to bbb for s p or baa for moody s  at december   we would have been required to provide letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million to satisfy this requirement of our isda agreements 
the amount of any letters of credit we would have to establish under the terms of our isda agreements would reduce the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facility 
we may not have sufficient cash flows to enable us to continue to pay distributions at the current level 
we may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to enable us to pay distributions at the current level 
the amount of cash we are able to distribute depends on the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which can fluctuate quarterly based upon a number of factors 
the amount of cash available for distribution also will depend on other factors  including the level of capital expenditures we make  the amount of cash reserves established by enbridge management  our ability to access capital markets and borrow money  our debt service requirements and restrictions in our credit agreements  fluctuations in our working capital needs  and the cost of acquisitions 
in addition  unitholders should note that the amount of cash we distribute depends primarily on our cash flow rather than net income or net loss 
therefore  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record net losses or may make no distributions during periods when we record net income 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful if we incorrectly predict operating results  are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and integrate acquired assets or businesses or are unable to raise financing on acceptable terms 
the acquisition of complementary energy delivery assets is a component of our strategy 
acquisitions present various risks and challenges  including the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of the acquired operations or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring such operations  a decrease in liquidity as a result of utilizing significant amounts of available cash or borrowing capacity to finance an acquisition  the loss of critical customers or employees at the acquired business  the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not fully and adequately indemnified  the risk of failing to effectively integrate the operations or management of acquired assets or businesses or a significant delay in such integration  and diversion of management s attention from existing operations 
in addition  we may be unable to identify acquisition targets and consummate acquisitions in the future or be unable to raise  on terms we find acceptable  any debt or equity financing that may be required for any such acquisition 
our financial performance could be adversely affected if our pipeline systems are used less 
our financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes transported on our pipeline systems 
decreases in the volumes transported by our systems can directly and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the volume transported on our pipelines can be influenced by factors beyond our control including competition  regulatory action  weather conditions storage levels  alternative energy sources  decreased demand  fluctuations in energy commodity prices  economic conditions  supply disruptions  availability of supply connected to our pipeline systems  and availability and adequacy of infrastructure to move supply into and out of our systems 
the volume of shipments on our lakehead system depends heavily on the supplies of western canadian crude oil 
insufficient supplies of western canadian crude oil will adversely affect our business by limiting shipments on our lakehead system 
decreases in conventional crude oil exploration and production activities in western canada and other factors  including supply disruption  higher development costs and competition  can slow the rate of growth of our lakehead system 
the volume of crude oil that we transport on our lakehead system also depends on the demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the volumes of crude oil and refined products delivered by others into these regions and the province of ontario 
pipeline capacity for the delivery of crude oil to the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states currently exceeds refining capacity 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  our ability to increase deliveries to expand our lakehead system in the future depends on increased supplies of western canadian crude oil 
we expect that growth in future supplies of western canadian crude oil will come from oil sands projects in alberta  canada 
full utilization of additional capacity as a result of our current and future expansions of our lakehead system  including the southern access project  will largely depend on these anticipated increases in crude oil production from oil sands projects 
a reduction in demand for crude oil or a decline in crude oil prices may make certain oil sands projects uneconomic since development costs for production of crude oil from oil sands is greater than development costs for production of conventional crude oil 
crude oil prices remain volatile and have declined significantly in recent months 
oil sands producers may cancel or delay plans to expand their facilities  as some oil sands producers have already done  if crude oil prices remain at current levels or decline further 
additionally  measures adopted by the government of the province of alberta to increase its share of revenues from oil sands development coupled with the decline in crude oil prices could reduce the volume growth we have anticipated in executing our construction projects to increase the capacity of our crude oil pipelines 
the volume of shipments on natural gas and ngl systems depends on the supply of natural gas and ngls available for shipment from the producing regions that supply these systems 
supply available for shipment can be affected by many factors  including commodity prices  weather and drilling activity 
volumes shipped on these systems also are affected by the demand for natural gas and ngls in the markets these systems serve 
existing customers may not extend their contracts for a variety of reasons  including a decline in the availability of natural gas from our mid continent  us gulf coast and east texas producing regions  or if the cost of transporting natural gas from other producing regions through other pipelines into the markets served by the natural gas systems were to render the delivered cost of natural gas on our systems uneconomical 
we may be unable to find additional customers to replace the lost demand or transportation fees 
competition may reduce our revenues 
our lakehead system faces current  and potentially further competition for transporting western canadian crude oil from other pipelines  which may reduce our revenues 
our lakehead system competes with other crude oil and refined product pipelines and other methods of delivering crude oil and refined products to the refining centers of minneapolis st 
paul  minnesota  chicago  illinois  detroit  michigan  toledo  ohio  buffalo  new york  and sarnia  ontario and the refinery market and pipeline hub located in the patoka wood river area of southern illinois 
refineries in the markets served by our lakehead system compete with refineries in western canada  the province of ontario and the rocky mountain region of the united states for supplies of western canadian crude oil 
our ozark pipeline system could face a significant increase in competition if a proposed new pipeline from hardisty to patoka is completed in however  if that situation occurs  we would consider potential alternative uses for our ozark system 
we also encounter competition in our natural gas gathering  treating  processing and transmission businesses 
a number of new interstate natural gas transmission pipelines being constructed could reduce the revenue we derive from the interstate and intrastate transmission of natural gas 
many of the large wholesale customers served by our systems transmission and wholesale customer pipelines have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities 
thus  many of these wholesale customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines and or from third parties that may hold capacity on other pipelines 
our midla system has recently negotiated the renewal of a contract with one of its primary customers 
other systems such as our alatenn system face similar competition for customers 
likewise  most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering and processing facilities available to them 
in addition  they have other alternatives  such as building their own gathering facilities or  in some cases  selling their natural gas supplies without processing 
some of our natural gas marketing competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger supplies of natural gas than those available to us  which could allow those competitors to price their services more aggressively than we do 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our gas marketing operations involve market and regulatory risks 
as part of our natural gas marketing activities  we purchase natural gas at prices determined by prevailing market conditions 
following our purchase of natural gas  we generally resell natural gas at a higher price under a sales contract that is generally comparable in terms to our purchase contract  including any price escalation provisions 
the profitability of our natural gas operations may be affected by the following factors our ability to negotiate on a timely basis natural gas purchase and sales agreements in changing markets  reluctance of wholesale customers to enter into long term purchase contracts  consumers willingness to use other fuels when natural gas prices increase significantly  timing of imbalance or volume discrepancy corrections and their impact on financial results  the ability of our customers to make timely payment  inability to match purchase and sale of natural gas on comparable terms  and changes in  limitations upon or elimination of the regulatory authorization required for our wholesale sales of natural gas in interstate commerce 
our results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility and risks associated with our hedging activities 
the prices of natural gas  ngls and crude oil are inherently volatile and we expect this volatility will continue 
we buy and sell natural gas and ngls in connection with our marketing activities 
our exposure to commodity price volatility is inherent to our natural gas and ngl purchase and resale activities  in addition to our natural gas processing activities 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to reduce our commodity price exposure  we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the level of the hedges 
however  because we are not fully hedged  we will continue to have commodity price exposure on the unhedged portion of the fees we derive from the commodities we receive in kind as payment for our gathering  processing  treating and transportation services 
we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices on to percent of the natural gas and ngls we expect to receive in the near term 
as a result of this unhedged exposure  a substantial decline in the prices of these commodities could adversely affect our financial performance 
additionally  our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows 
our hedging activities can result in substantial losses if hedging arrangements are imperfect or ineffective and our hedging policies and procedures are not followed properly or do not work as intended 
further  hedging contracts are subject to the credit risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the contracts  particularly during periods of weak and volatile economic conditions 
in addition  certain of the financial instruments we use to hedge our commodity risk exposures must be accounted for on a mark to market basis 
this causes periodic earnings volatility due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
changes in  or challenges to  our rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the rates charged by several of our pipeline systems are regulated by the ferc or state regulatory agencies or both 
if one of these regulatory agencies  on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties  were to lower our tariff rates  the profitability of our pipeline businesses would suffer 
if we were permitted to raise our tariff rates for a particular pipeline  there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect  which delay could further reduce our cash flow 
furthermore  competition from other pipeline systems may prevent us from raising our tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit us to do so 
the regulatory agencies that regulate our systems periodically implement new rules  regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction 
new initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for our services 
some producing states  including oklahoma and texas  
table of contents 
index to financial statements are considering legislation that would require rate and or service regulation of gathering and intrastate transmission natural gas systems 
increased state regulation could adversely impact our natural gas systems 
we believe that the rates we charge for transportation services on our interstate common carrier oil and open access natural gas pipelines are just and reasonable under the ica and nga  respectively 
however  because the rates that we charge are subject to review upon an appropriately supported protest or complaint  or a regulator s own initiative  we cannot predict what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future for service on our interstate common carrier oil and open access natural gas pipelines 
furthermore  because rates charged for transportation services must be competitive with those charged by other transporters  the rates set forth in our tariffs will be determined based on competitive factors in addition to regulatory considerations 
increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny may reduce our revenues our interstate pipelines and certain activities of our intrastate natural gas pipelines are subject to ferc regulation of terms and conditions of service 
in the case of interstate natural gas pipelines  ferc also establishes requirements respecting the construction and abandonment of pipeline facilities 
ferc has pending proposals to increase posting and other compliance requirements applicable to natural gas markets  and in  has continued to step up its enforcement efforts 
the new political administration is focused on energy policy and has the authority to name new ferc commissioners  including a chairman  to reflect a democratic majority 
such changes could prompt an increase in ferc regulatory oversight of our pipelines and additional legislation that could increase our ferc regulatory compliance costs and decrease the net income generated by our pipeline systems 
compliance with environmental and operational safety regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities 
our pipeline  gathering  processing and trucking operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational and worker safety 
numerous governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with the laws and regulations they administer and permits they issue  oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions 
our failure to comply with these laws  regulations and operating permits can result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations 
our operation of liquid petroleum and natural gas gathering  processing  treating and transportation facilities exposes us to the risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities 
additionally  operational modifications necessary to comply with regulatory requirements and resulting from our handling of liquid petroleum and natural gas  historical environmental contamination  accidental releases or upsets  regulatory enforcement  litigation or safety and health incidents can also result in significant cost 
we may incur joint and several strict liability under these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of liquid petroleum and natural gas and wastes on  under or from our properties and facilities  many of which have been used for gathering or processing activities for a number of years  oftentimes by third parties not under our control 
private parties  including the owners of properties through which our gathering systems pass and facilities where our liquid petroleum and natural gas or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal  may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage 
we may also incur costs in the future due to changes in environmental and safety laws and regulations  or re interpretations of enforcement policies or claims for personal  property or environmental damage 
we may not be able to recover these costs from insurance or through higher rates 
our operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 
canada is one of many foreign nations participating in the kyoto protocol  a treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
the treaty requires canada to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below levels by while the united states is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol  its congress has been actively 
table of contents 
index to financial statements considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the development of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
in addition  more than one third of the states already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
further  on april   the united states supreme court in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as and air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
in july  the epa released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act and other potential methods of regulating greenhouse gases 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows  in addition to the demand for our services 
pipeline operations involve numerous risks that may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
operation of complex pipeline systems  gathering  treating  processing and trucking operations involves many risks  hazards and uncertainties 
these events include adverse weather conditions  accidents  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  the performance of the facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions  fires  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  landslides or other similar events beyond our control 
these types of catastrophic events could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution and impairment of our operations  any of which could also result in substantial losses for which we may bear a part or all of the cost 
for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas  including residential communities  commercial business centers  industrial sites and other public gathering locations  the level of damage resulting from these catastrophic events could be greater 
measurement adjustments on our pipeline system can be materially impacted by changes in estimation  commodity prices and other factors 
oil measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operations associated with our liquid petroleum pipelines 
the three types of oil measurement adjustments that routinely occur on our systems include physical  which result from evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents  degradation  which result from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation  which are a function of crude oil prices  the level of our carriers inventory and the inventory positions of customers 
quantifying oil measurement adjustments is inherently difficult because physical measurements of volumes are not practical as products continuously move through our pipelines and virtually all of our pipeline systems are located underground 
in our case  measuring and quantifying oil measurement losses is especially difficult because of the length of our pipeline systems and the number of different grades of crude oil and types of crude oil products we carry 
accordingly  we utilize engineering based models and operational assumptions to estimate product volumes in our system and associated oil measurement losses 
natural gas measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines 
the quantification and resolution of measurement adjustments is complicated by several factors including the significant quantities ie  thousands of measurement meters that we use throughout our natural gas systems  primarily around our gathering and processing assets  varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems  and variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies 
each of these factors may contribute to measurement adjustments that can occur on our natural gas systems 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we are exposed to credit risks of our customers  and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations 
some of our customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant affect on their creditworthiness 
severe financial problems encountered by our customers could limit our ability to collect amounts owed to us  or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements 
in addition  many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity 
recently  there has been a significant decline in the credit markets and the availability of credit 
the market capitalizations of many of our customers have substantially declined 
the combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices  a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of our customers liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to us 
furthermore  some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks  which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us 
financial problems experienced by our customers could result in the impairment of our assets  reduction of our operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services  which could reduce our revenues 
risks arising from our partnership structure and relationships with our general partner and enbridge management the interests of enbridge may differ from our interests and the interests of our security holders  and the board of directors of enbridge management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict  not just the interests of our security holders  in making important business decisions 
enbridge indirectly owns all of the shares of our general partner and all of the voting shares of enbridge management  and elects all of the directors of both companies 
furthermore  some of the directors and officers of our general partners and enbridge management are also directors and officers of enbridge 
consequently  conflicts of interest could arise between our unitholders and enbridge 
our partnership agreement limits the fiduciary duties of our general partner to our unitholders 
these restrictions allow our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest by considering the interests of all of the parties to the conflict  including enbridge management s interests  our interests and those of our general partner 
in addition  these limitations reduce the rights of our unitholders under our partnership agreement to sue our general partner or enbridge management  its delegate  should its directors or officers act in a way that  were it not for these limitations of liability  would constitute breaches of their fiduciary duties 
we do not have any employees 
in managing our business and affairs  we rely on employees of enbridge  and its affiliates  who act on behalf of and as agents for us 
a decrease in the availability of employees from enbridge could adversely affect us 
our partnership agreement and the delegation of control agreement limit the fiduciary duties that enbridge management and our general partner owe to our unitholders and restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by enbridge management and our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty 
our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that our general partner would otherwise owe to our unitholders under state fiduciary duty law 
through the delegation of control agreement  these modified fiduciary duties also apply to enbridge management as the delegate of our general partner 
for example  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions  including the determination of which factors it will consider in resolving conflicts of interest  in its sole discretion 
this entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires  and it has no duty or obligation to give consideration to any interest of  or factors affecting  us  our affiliates or any unitholder  
table of contents 
index to financial statements provides that any standard of care and duty imposed on our general partner will be modified  waived or limited as required to permit our general partner to act under our partnership agreement and to make any decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in our partnership agreement  so long as such action is reasonably believed by the general partner to be in our best interests  and provides that our general partner and its directors and officers will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our unitholders for any acts or omissions if they acted in good faith 
these and similar provisions in our partnership agreement may restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by enbridge management or our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty 
potential conflicts of interest may arise among enbridge and its shareholders  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
because the fiduciary duties of the directors of our general partner and enbridge management have been modified  the directors may be permitted to make decisions that benefit enbridge and its shareholders or enbridge management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders 
conflicts of interest may arise from time to time among enbridge and its shareholders  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
conflicts of interest may also arise from time to time between us and our unitholders  on the one hand  and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
in managing and controlling us as the delegate of our general partner  enbridge management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict and may resolve those conflicts by making decisions that benefit enbridge and its shareholders or enbridge management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders 
the following decisions  among others  could involve conflicts of interest whether we or enbridge will pursue certain acquisitions or other business opportunities  whether we will issue additional units or other equity securities or whether we will purchase outstanding units  whether enbridge management will issue additional shares  the amount of payments to enbridge and its affiliates for any services rendered for our benefit  the amount of costs that are reimbursable to enbridge management or enbridge and its affiliates by us  the enforcement of obligations owed to us by enbridge management  our general partner or enbridge  including obligations regarding competition between enbridge and us  and the retention of separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for us and enbridge management 
in these and similar situations  any decision by enbridge management may benefit one group more than another  and in making such decisions  enbridge management may consider the interests of all groups  as well as other factors  in deciding whether to take a particular course of action 
in other situations  enbridge may take certain actions  including engaging in businesses that compete with us  that are adverse to us and our unitholders 
for example  although enbridge and its subsidiaries are generally restricted from engaging in any business that is in direct material competition with our businesses  that restriction is subject to the following significant exceptions enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from continuing to engage in businesses  including the normal development of such businesses  in which they were engaged at the time of our initial public offering in december  such restriction is limited geographically only to those routes and products for which we provided transportation at the time of our initial public offering  
table of contents 
index to financial statements enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us as part of a larger acquisition  so long as the majority of the value of the business or assets acquired  in enbridge s reasonable judgment  is not attributable to the competitive business  and enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us if that business is first offered for acquisition to us and the board of directors of enbridge management and our unitholders determine not to pursue the acquisition 
since we were not engaged in any aspect of the natural gas business at the time of our initial public offering  enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from competing with us in any aspect of the natural gas business 
in addition  enbridge and its subsidiaries would be permitted to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum over routes that are not the same as our lakehead system  even if such transportation is in direct material competition with our business 
these exceptions also expressly permitted the reversal by enbridge in of one of its pipelines that extends from sarnia  ontario to montreal  quebec 
as a result of this reversal  enbridge competes with us to supply crude oil to the ontario  canada market 
we can issue additional common or other classes of units  including additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares  which would dilute your ownership interest 
the issuance of additional common or other classes of units by us  including the issuance of additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares and the issuance of additional class c units  may have the following effects the amount available for distributions on each unit may decrease  the relative voting power of each previously outstanding unit may decrease  and the market price of the class a common units may decline 
additionally  the public sale by our general partner of a significant portion of the class b common units or class c units that it currently owns could reduce the market price of the class a common units 
our partnership agreement allows the general partner to cause us to register for public sale any units held by the general partner or its affiliates 
a public or private sale of the class b common units or class c units currently held by our general partner could absorb some of the trading market demand for the outstanding class a common units 
the class a common units issuable upon conversion of our class c units may be sold in the public or private markets  which could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our class a common units 
as of february   we had approximately  class c units outstanding  which will convert into class a common units on a one for one basis on august   subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the sale of any of these class a common units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our class a common units 
holders of our limited partner interests have limited voting rights our unitholders have limited voting rights on matters affecting our business  which may have a negative effect on the price at which our common units trade 
in particular  the unitholders did not elect our general partner or the directors of our general partner or enbridge management and have no rights to elect our general partner or the directors of our general partner or enbridge management on an annual or other continuing basis 
furthermore  if unitholders are not satisfied with the performance of our general partner  they may find it difficult to remove our general partner 
under the provisions of our partnership agreement  our general partner may be removed upon the vote of at least of the outstanding common units and class c units voting together as a class excluding the units held by the general partner and its affiliates and a majority of the outstanding i units voting together as a separate class excluding the number of i units corresponding to the number of shares of enbridge management held by our general partner and its affiliates 
such removal must  
table of contents 
index to financial statements however  provide for the election and succession of a new general partner  who may be required to purchase the departing general partner interest in us in order to become the successor general partner 
such restrictions may limit the flexibility of the limited partners in removing our general partner  and removal may also result in the general partner interest in us held by the departing general partner being converted into class a common units 
we are a holding company and depend entirely on our operating subsidiaries distributions to service our debt obligations 
we are a holding company with no material operations 
if we cannot receive cash distributions from our operating subsidiaries  we will not be able to meet our debt service obligations 
our operating subsidiaries may from time to time incur additional indebtedness under agreements that contain restrictions  which could further limit each operating subsidiary s ability to make distributions to us 
the debt securities we issue and any guarantees issued by any of our subsidiaries that are guarantors will be structurally subordinated to the claims of the creditors of any of our operating subsidiaries who are not guarantors of the debt securities 
holders of the debt securities will not be creditors of our operating subsidiaries who have not guaranteed the debt securities 
the claims to the assets of these non guarantor operating subsidiaries derive from our own ownership interest in those operating subsidiaries 
claims of our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors will generally have priority as to the assets of such operating subsidiaries over our own ownership interest claims and will therefore have priority over the holders of our debt  including the debt securities 
our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors may include general creditors  trade creditors  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and creditors holding guarantees 
enbridge management s discretion in establishing our cash reserves gives it the ability to reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
enbridge management may establish cash reserves for us that in its reasonable discretion are necessary to fund our future operating and capital expenditures  provide for the proper conduct of business  and comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners 
these cash reserves affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our holders of common units 
risks related to our debt and our ability to make distributions agreements relating to our debt restrict our ability to make distributions  which could adversely affect the value of our class a common units  and our ability to incur additional debt and otherwise maintain financial and operating flexibility 
our most significant operating subsidiary is restricted by its first mortgage notes from making distributions to us  other than in additional partnership interests in it  unless the distribution is in cash  the distribution amount does not exceed the current available cash of that subsidiary  a default does not exist under the first mortgage notes immediately after giving effect to the distribution and timely notice of the distribution has been give to the holders of the first mortgage notes 
in addition  we are prohibited from making distributions to our unitholders during the existence of certain defaults under our credit facility or during a period in which we have elected to defer interest payments on the junior notes  subject to limited exceptions as set forth in the related indenture 
further  the agreements governing our credit facility and our subsidiary s first mortgage notes may prevent us from engaging in transactions or capitalizing on business opportunities that we believe could be beneficial to us by requiring us to comply with various covenants  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on incurring additional debt  
table of contents 
index to financial statements entering into mergers or consolidations or sales of assets  and granting liens 
although the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional debt  they impose restrictions on our ability to enter into mergers or consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets  to incur liens to secure debt and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 
a breach of any restriction under our credit facility or our indentures or our subsidiary s first mortgage notes could permit the holders of the related debt to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements immediately due and payable and  in the case of our credit facility  terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
any subsequent refinancing of our current debt or any new indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have similar or greater restrictions 
tax risks to common unitholders we may be classified as an association taxable as a corporation rather than as a partnership  which would substantially reduce the value of our class a common units 
we could be treated as a corporation for united states income tax purposes 
our treatment as a corporation would substantially reduce the cash distributions on the common units that we distribute quarterly 
moreover  treatment of us as a corporation could materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
the anticipated benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on the treatment of us as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
under current law  we are treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and do not pay any federal income tax at the entity level 
in order to qualify for this treatment  we must derive more than of our annual gross income from specified investments and activities 
while we believe that we currently do qualify and intend to meet this income requirement  we may not find it possible  regardless of our efforts  to meet this income requirement or may inadvertently fail to meet this income requirement 
current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes without regard to our sources of income or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
if we were to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of and would pay state income taxes at varying rates 
under current law  distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed as a corporate distribution 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  the cash available for distribution to a unitholder would be substantially reduced 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a substantial reduction in the value of our units 
in addition  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise  or other forms of taxation similar to recent tax legislation in texas and michigan 
state tax legislation resulting in the imposition of a partnership level income tax on us could reduce the cash distributions we make on the class a and b common units and the number of i units and class c units that we will distribute quarterly 
the enactment of significant legislation imposing partnership level income taxes could cause a reduction in the value of our class a common units 
if the internal revenue service does not respect our curative tax allocations  the after tax return to our unitholders on their investment in our class a common units would be adversely affected 
our partnership agreement allows curative allocations of income  deduction  gain and loss by us to account for differences between the tax basis and fair market value of property at the time the property is contributed or deemed contributed to us and to account for differences between the fair market value and book basis of our assets existing at the time of issuance of any class a common units 
if the internal revenue service  which we refer to as the irs  does not respect our curative allocations  ratios of taxable income to cash distributions received by the holders of class a common units will be materially higher than previously estimated 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the tax liability of our unitholders could exceed their distributions or proceeds from sales of class a common units 
the holders of our class a common units will be required to pay united states federal income tax and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their allocable share of our income  even if they do not receive cash distributions from us 
they will not necessarily receive cash distributions equal to the tax on their allocable share of our taxable income 
further  if we have a large amount of nonrecourse liabilities  they may incur a tax liability that is greater than the money they receive when they sell their class a common units 
a unitholder may be required to file tax returns with and pay income taxes to the states where we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business 
in some cases  a unitholder may be required to file income tax returns with and pay income taxes to the states in which we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business  which are currently alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kansas  kentucky  louisiana  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  missouri  montana  new york  south carolina  north carolina  north dakota  oklahoma  tennessee  texas and wisconsin 
in the future  we may acquire property or do business in other states or in foreign jurisdictions 
in addition to tax liabilities to such state and foreign jurisdictions  the owner of a class a common unit may also incur tax and filing responsibilities to localities within such jurisdictions 
ownership of class a common units raises issues for tax exempt entities and other investors 
an investment in our class a common units by tax exempt entities  including employee benefit plans  individual retirement accounts  keogh plans and other retirement plans  regulated investment companies and foreign persons raises issues unique to them 
virtually all of the income derived from our class a common units by a tax exempt entity will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to the tax exempt entity 
further  a unitholder who is a nonresident alien  a foreign corporation or other foreign person will be required to file a federal income tax return and pay tax on his share of our taxable income because he will be regarded as being engaged in a trade or business in the united states as a result of his ownership of a class a common unit 
our registration with the secretary of the treasury as a tax shelter may increase your risk of an irs audit 
because we are a registered tax shelter with the secretary of the treasury  a unitholder may face an increased risk of an irs audit resulting in taxes payable on our income as well as income not related to us 
we could be audited by the irs and adjustments to our income or losses could be made 
any unitholder owning less than a profit interest in us has very limited rights to participate in the income tax and audit process 
further  any adjustments in our tax returns will lead to adjustments in the unitholders tax returns and may lead to audits of unitholders tax returns and adjustments of items unrelated to us 
each unitholder is responsible for any tax owed as the result of an examination of their personal tax return 
we have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the class a common units 
when we issue additional class a common units or engage in certain other transactions  we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  subsequent purchasers of class a common units may have a greater portion of their internal revenue code section b adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our valuation methods  or our allocation of the section b adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets  and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders 

table of contents 
index to financial statements a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of class a common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the class a common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
we treat each purchaser of class a common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual class a common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could result in a unitholder owing more tax and may adversely affect the value of the class a common units 
to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our class a common units  we have adopted certain depreciation and amortization positions that are inconsistent with existing treasury regulations 
these positions may result in an understatement of deductions and losses and an overstatement of income and gain to our unitholders 
for example  we do not amortize certain goodwill assets  the value of which has been attributed to certain of our outstanding class a common units 
a subsequent holder of those class a common units is entitled to an amortization deduction attributable to that goodwill under internal revenue code section b 
however  because we cannot identify these class a common units once they are traded by the initial holder  we do not give any subsequent holder of a class a common unit any such amortization deduction 
this approach understates deductions available to those unitholders who own those class a common units and results in a reduction in the tax basis of those class a common units by the amount of the deductions that were allowable but were not taken 
the irs may challenge the manner in which we calculate our unitholder s basis adjustment under internal revenue code section b 
if so  because neither we nor a unitholder can identify the class a common units to which this issue relates once the initial holder has traded them  the irs may assert adjustments to all unitholders selling class a common units within the period under audit as if all unitholders owned class a common units with respect to which allowable deductions were not taken 
any position we take that is inconsistent with applicable treasury regulations may have to be disclosed on our federal income tax return 
this disclosure increases the likelihood that the irs will challenge our positions and propose adjustments to some or all of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to this position or other positions we may take could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss allocated to our unitholders 
it also could affect the gain from a unitholder s sale of class a common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the class a common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions

impact of current economic crisis multiple events during  involving the financial sector of the global economy  have effectively restricted current liquidity within the capital markets throughout the united states and around the world 
despite efforts by treasury and banking regulators to provide liquidity to the financial sector  capital markets continue to remain constrained 
we expect our access to the capital markets to be restricted over the next twelve months and possibly longer should capital markets remain dysfunctional 
as a result  our ability to raise debt and equity at prices that are similar to offerings in recent years will continue to be limited 
see liquidity and capital resources impact of current economic crisis for additional discussion about the effect of the current economic crisis on us 
the current economic crisis has created a challenging operating environment for us 
we are acting decisively to address this crisis through enhanced management of our operating costs and discretionary capital spending 
we intend to move forward with our commercially supported internal growth projects  predominately within our liquids business 
our ability to access the capital markets to fund new projects in the near term is likely to be limited 
we are also considering non traditional sources of financing for our growth projects such as private equity  asset partnership arrangements and non core asset sales 
over the next months  we will focus on preserving sufficient liquidity to fund our growth programs and maintaining our present distribution rate per unit 
at december   we have in excess of billion of liquidity to meet our ongoing operational and investment and finance needs  which we have determined as follows in millions availability under credit facility available under enbridge us credit agreement cash and cash equivalents total results of operations overview we provide services to our customers and returns for our unitholders primarily through the following activities interstate pipeline transportation and storage of crude oil and liquid petroleum  gathering  treating  processing and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids  or ngls  through pipelines and related facilities  and supply  transportation and sales services  including purchasing and selling natural gas and ngls 
we conduct our business through three business segments liquids  natural gas and marketing 
these segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of our long term objectives  to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance

our unhedged commodity position is fully exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices 
these fluctuations can be very significant as evidenced by commodity prices during we employ derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our commodity position and to reduce our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices 
some of these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

 which can create volatility in our earnings that can be significant 
however  these fluctuations in earnings do not affect our cash flow 
cash flow is only affected when we settle the derivative financial instrument 
summary analysis of operating results liquids our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota and mid continent systems 
these systems largely consist of ferc regulated interstate crude oil and liquid petroleum pipelines 
the lakehead system  together with the enbridge system in canada  forms the longest liquid petroleum pipeline system in the world 
these systems generate revenues primarily from charging shippers a rate per barrel to transport and store crude oil and liquid petroleum 
operating income from our liquids segment increased million to million for the year ended december  from the million contributed for the year ended december  the increase in operating income of our liquids segment is primarily due to the following tariff increases that went into effect in april associated with our southern access expansion and in january for the phase v expansion of our north dakota system  additional revenue resulting from higher average crude oil prices associated with the allowance oil we receive in connection with our transportation services  and higher delivery volumes on our lakehead system 
natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  including three ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipelines  as well as natural gas treating and processing plants 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and related facilities 
the revenues of our natural gas segment are associated with the services we provide to gather and process natural gas and to transport natural gas on our pipelines 
generally  our revenues are in the form of fee for service arrangements and or sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
operating income from our natural gas segment increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the following factors affected the operating income of our natural gas segment million of unrealized  non cash mark to market net gains from derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
for the year ended december   as compared with net losses of million for the same period of  volume growth associated with the substantial completion of our east texas natural gas system expansion and extension  referred to as the clarity project  coupled with strong production from the bossier trend  granite wash and barnett shale formations  lower processing margins resulting from higher average prices for natural gas used for processing  coupled with a continued shift in our contract mix from keep whole to percentage of liquids  or pol  type contracts  reduced revenues of approximately million associated with the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike  when third party facilities downstream of our operations were damaged or without power 
physical damage to our facilities was minimal  although we did incur capital and operating costs approximating million for repairs to several of our natural gas systems during the third and fourth quarters of our three major natural gas systems have been returned to pre hurricane levels  declines in the prices of natural gas and ngls from july through december  decreased the value of our in kind natural gas imbalance receivables and produced non cash charges to reduce the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to net realizable value  and variable operating and administrative cost increases associated with our system growth 
marketing our marketing segment provides supply  transmission  storage and sales services to producers and wholesale customers on our gathering  transmission and customer pipelines  as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
our marketing activities are primarily undertaken to realize incremental revenue on gas purchased at the wellhead  increase pipeline utilization and provide other services that are valued by our customers 
operating income from our marketing segment decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the change in operating income of our marketing segment is primarily a result of the following unrealized  non cash mark to market net losses for of million compared with non cash mark to market net losses of million for  resulting from the change in market value of our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  and non cash charges of million in  resulting from a reduction of the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to market value  which is million more than the million we recorded in derivative transactions and hedging activities we record all derivative instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair market value pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 and the guidance set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurement sfas no 

for those derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  we record all changes in fair market value through our consolidated statements of income each period 
based on our risk management policies  all of our derivative instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability and or forecasted transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on interest rates or commodity prices

index to financial statements declining commodity prices in the second half of produced million of unrealized  non cash mark to market net gains  primarily from derivative financial instruments we use to hedge our optional ngl production 
during the year ended december   rising ngl prices coupled with relatively stable natural gas prices produced million of unrealized non cash mark to market net losses from derivative financial instruments we use to hedge our option ngl production 
the increases in fair value of our portfolio of commodity based derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting result when the underlying prices for natural gas  ngls and crude oil decline below the prices set forth in the derivative contracts 
likewise  decreases in the fair value of our portfolio of derivative financial instruments result when the underlying prices for natural gas  natural gas  ngls and crude oil increase above the prices set forth in the derivative contracts 
mark to market gains or losses create volatility in our operating results although the derivative instruments we have in place do not affect our cash flow until they are settled 
we expect these non cash gains and losses to reverse in future periods as we settle the derivative instruments against the underlying physical transactions 
we intend to continue using derivative instruments to hedge our portfolio of natural gas and ngls because of the economic benefit we derive from reducing the volatility in our cash flows 
our continued use of derivative instruments is likely to result in additional unrealized  non cash gains and losses in the future

operating revenue for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the same period in the increase in operating revenue is due to the following increased average rates for transportation on all of our major systems as noted below  higher delivery volumes on our lakehead and north dakota systems  additional revenue resulting from higher crude oil prices associated with the allowance oil we receive in connection with our transportation services  and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements additional contract storage fees revenue generated by our mid continent storage terminal system 
increases in average transportation rates on all three liquids systems together with longer hauls contributed approximately million of additional operating revenue 
we filed new tariff rates in on our lakehead system  effective april   to reflect the recent completion of four projects the southern access mainline expansion  two superior terminal tank projects  two griffith terminal tank projects and the clearbrook manifold project 
we also implemented new tariff rates on our north dakota system  effective january   to reflect the completion of our north dakota phase v expansion 
additionally  we increased the average transportation rates on all three of our liquids systems in connection with the annual index rate ceiling adjustment that went into effect july  average delivery volumes on our lakehead system increased approximately percent  to million bpd for the year ended december  from million bpd during the same period in this increase contributed an additional million to operating revenue 
the increase in average deliveries on our lakehead system is primarily derived from increases of crude oil supplies from upstream production facilities associated with the ongoing development of the oil sands in alberta  canada alberta oil sands 
our transportation tariff allows our pipelines to deduct an allowance from our customers for the transportation of their crude oil 
we recognize revenue for this allowance at the prevailing market price for crude oil 
the average prices of crude oil during the year ended december  were substantially higher than the average prices for the same period of for example  the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil has increased approximately percent for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in as a result of the increase in crude oil prices  we experienced an approximate million increase in allowance oil revenues 
also contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended december   was an approximately million increase in contract storage and spot storage fees generated by our mid continent storage terminal system from the additional storage tanks we placed in service during mid and late across our mid continent system  we added a net of seven storage tanks during contributing an additional million barrels of capacity bringing the total storage capacity to approximately million barrels and tanks 
this additional storage capacity is expected to provide ongoing fixed  variable  and spot storage revenue 
operating and administrative expenses for the liquids segment increased million for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the increase in these costs is primarily attributable to the following additional workforce related costs for the operational  administrative  regulatory  and compliance support services necessary for our growing systems  increased costs related to repair and maintenance activities  unfavorable oil measurement adjustments as described below  further costs incurred in connection with the crude oil release and fire on line of our lakehead system  and modest increases in property taxes due to favorable settlements of property tax assessments that we realized during the year ended december  which were not present for the same period in our general partner charges us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel who are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
we have experienced an increase in workforce related costs as a result of the growth and expansion of our liquids system operations 
oil measurement adjustments occur as part of the normal operations associated with our liquid petroleum pipelines 
the three types of oil measurement adjustments that routinely occur on our systems include physical  which result from evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents

index to financial statements degradation  which result from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation  which are a function of crude oil prices  the level of our carriers inventory and the inventory positions of customers 
power costs increased million in the year ended december   compared with the same period in  predominantly due to the higher delivery volumes coupled with higher utility rates we are charged by our power suppliers 
we have experienced a trend of increasing electricity rates from our power suppliers due to higher natural gas and coal costs associated with volatile pricing of these commodities 
the increase in depreciation expense of million is attributable to the additional assets we have placed in service during and for the year ended december   including the southern access expansion stage one assets that we placed in service during the second quarter of along with the assets placed into service on our north dakota and mid continent systems 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income in  representing an increase of million over the favorable results of our liquids business reflect modest growth in our transportation volumes while actively managing the costs of our services 
the majority of this increase related to improved results on our lakehead system 
operating revenue for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the same period in the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the higher delivery volumes on our lakehead and north dakota systems combined with the increase in average transportation rates associated with the annual index rate increase that went into effect july   for all three of our liquids systems 
we increased the transportation rates on our lakehead system by an average of percent and on our ozark and north dakota systems by an average of percent 
additionally  new tariffs went into effect april   on our lakehead system to reflect the annual calculation of the sep ii and other surcharges  as well as an adjustment for the terrace surcharge due to lower than expected volumes moving on the lakehead system in the transportation rate increases of our liquids systems contributed approximately million to the increase in our revenues for the year ended december  also contributing to the increase in revenues for the year ended december   was a million increase in contract storage fees generated by our mid continent storage terminal system from the additional storage tanks we placed in service during and in late across our mid continent system  we added a net of seven storage tanks during contributing an additional million barrels of capacity  bringing the total storage capacity to approximately million barrels and tanks 
this additional storage capacity is expected to provide ongoing fixed  variable  and spot storage revenue 
average delivery volumes on our liquids systems increased to million bpd for the year ended december   from the million bpd during the same period in  accounting for approximately million of the increase in the operating revenues of our liquids segment 
the increase in average deliveries on our liquids systems are primarily derived from modest production increases of western canadian crude oil delivered on our lakehead system 
the increase in deliveries is attributable to the following crude oil supplies increased from upstream production facilities associated with the ongoing development of the alberta oil sands by producers  our mid continent system continues to operate near capacity  and volume growth on our north dakota system associated with completion of our hydrostatic testing program and phasing in portions of a system expansion that was completed in the fourth quarter of

index to financial statements operating and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million or million greater than the million for the same period in the increase in these costs is primarily attributable to the following additional workforce related costs associated with the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our growing systems  further costs we incurred in connection with our pipeline integrity program  and property damage we sustained in connection with a crude oil release and fire on line of our lakehead system 
workforce related costs increased due to the additional resources and related benefit costs we are charged for the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our growing systems as discussed above in the year end analysis for december  the increase in operating and administrative costs is partially offset by a reduction for field inventory expenses we realized in that we did not incur in our pipeline systems consist of individual pipelines of varying ages from approximately years to newly constructed 
with appropriate inspection and maintenance  the physical life of a pipeline is indefinitely long 
however  as our pipelines age we anticipate that the level of expenditures required for inspection  renewal and maintenance will increase 
in addition  we have established temporary pressure restrictions on some sections of some of our pipelines pending completion of specific inspection and renewal programs  and may from time to time establish further temporary pressure restrictions 
pressure restrictions reduce the available capacity of the applicable line segment and could result in a loss of throughput if and when the full capacity of that line segment would otherwise have been utilized 
the loss of throughput to date  resulting from pressure restrictions  has not materially affected our operating results 
power costs increased million in  compared with  predominantly due to the higher utility rates we are charged by our power suppliers 
the increase in delivery volumes is also a factor contributing to the additional power costs 
we have experienced a trend of increasing electricity rates from our power suppliers due to higher natural gas costs 
future prospects for liquids historically  western canada has been a key source of oil supply serving us energy needs 
canada s oil sands  one of the largest oil reserves in the world  are becoming an increasingly prominent source of supply 
combined conventional and oil sands established reserves of approximately billion barrels compare with saudi arabia s proved reserves of approximately billion barrels 
the national energy board of canada  or neb  estimates that total wcsb production averaged approximately million bpd in and development of the alberta oil sands is expected to moderate due to declining demand and commodity prices and it is unlikely that all announced and planned oil sands projects will proceed as planned 
capp s december estimates of future production from the alberta oil sands is expected to grow steadily during the next years  with an additional million bpd of incremental supply available by  based on a subset of currently approved applications and announced expansions 
we and enbridge are actively working with our customers to develop transportation options that will allow canadian crude oil greater access to markets in the united states 
crude oil price volatility in has caused some oil sands producers to cancel or defer projects that were planned to commence over the next decade 
cancellations and project deferrals of oil sands projects are expected to temper the rate of growth over the next several years relative to prior forecasts 
if the rate of crude oil production from the western canadian sedimentary basin declines  immediate need for new pipeline infrastructures will likely decline 
in addition to our expansions  a new competitor is expected to complete construction of a pipeline system to wood river and patoka  illinois  and to cushing  oklahoma  with an initial capacity of  bpd and an ultimate capacity of  bpd 
this competing pipeline  together with our southern access and alberta clipper expansions may provide sufficient capacity for the near term 
if this is the case  we expect expansion activities in and around our lakehead system to continue but they may be more modest than experienced over the last several years 

table of contents 
index to financial statements status of partnership projects southern access we continue to progress on schedule on the second and final stage of the southern access expansion project which will provide additional upstream pumping capacity and a new pipeline from delavan to flanagan  illinois 
we commenced construction of this stage of the project on june  and expect to complete the project by the end of the first quarter of completion of the total southern access expansion project will create a mile pipeline with approximately  bpd of incremental capacity on our lakehead system which can be further expanded to million bpd with expenditures for additional pumping equipment 
the commercial structure for this expansion is a cost of service based surcharge that will be added to the existing transportation rates 
we anticipate that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda associated with this project will be approximate million annually in the first full year that both stages of the southern access project are fully operational 
alberta clipper the alberta clipper project involves construction of a new inch diameter   mile heavy crude oil pipeline from hardisty  alberta to superior  generally within or adjacent to our and enbridge s existing rights of way 
we will construct approximately miles of the new pipeline from the international border near neche  north dakota to superior  wisconsin  a delivery connection at clearbrook  minnesota and an additional tank at superior 
alberta clipper will have an initial capacity of  bpd and allows for expansions up to  bpd by adding pump stations 
in addition  complementary capacity on the southern access inch pipeline from superior to flanagan will be obtained by installing additional pump stations 
we anticipate that our share of the construction cost for the united states segment of the project will approximate billion 
alberta clipper will be a common carrier line fully integrated with the enbridge lakehead mainline systems for tolling purposes 
we and enbridge are progressing with the project  which is expected to be in service in mid we expect to begin construction on the us leg of the project in mid the commercial structure for this expansion is a cost of service based surcharge that will be added to the existing transportation rates 
we anticipate that the first full year ebitda resulting from the completion of this project will approximate million 
north dakota the united states geological survey  or usgs  completed an assessment of the undiscovered oil and associated natural gas resources of the upper devonian lower mississippi bakken formation in the united states portion of the williston basin and has determined there to be to billion barrels of technologically recoverable oil 
regional producers in the williston basin areas of montana and north dakota have expressed interest in further expansion of pipeline capacity on our north dakota system 
as a result  we have commenced an approximate billion additional expansion consisting of upgrades to existing pump stations  additional tankage  as well as extensive use of drag reducing agents dra that are injected into the pipeline 
this expansion of our north dakota system  referred to as phase vi  is expected to increase system capacity to  bpd from the  bpd that is currently available 
the commercial structure for this expansion is a cost of service based surcharge that will be added to the existing transportation rates 
the proposed tolling methodology is similar to the structure being used on the recently completed phase v expansion project and was approved by the ferc in october the phase vi expansion is expected to be in service in early trailbreaker formerly eastern padd ii access we and enbridge initiated plans to provide access for western canadian crude oil to refineries along the united states eastern seaboard and the united states gulf coast via the marine terminal at portland  maine 
the trailbreaker project contemplates the expansion and reversal of existing facilities to create a pipeline route to portland 
an open season process held by third party owned portland montreal pipe line did not receive sufficient commercial support for the reversal of one of its pipelines to transport crude oil from montreal  quebec

as a result  capp has exercised its right to withdraw support from the project at this time 
enbridge continues to engage in discussions with customers to determine timing and conditions for proceeding with this project 
enbridge and other projects spearhead pipeline in a further effort to provide shippers access to new markets  enbridge acquired a pipeline that previously shipped crude oil from cushing  oklahoma to chicago 
enbridge reversed the pipeline  renamed it spearhead  and began delivering canadian crude oil to the major oil hub at cushing in march since then  the pipeline has operated at or near its capacity of  bpd 
in the first half of  enbridge successfully concluded a binding open season for expansion of the pipeline to  bpd  with binding commitments for capacity of  bpd 
in december  the ferc issued a favorable declaratory order effectively approving the tolling methodology and priority service for shippers with binding commitments 
construction has commenced on the  bpd expansion  which is expected to be completed on schedule in early the spearhead pipeline is complementary to our lakehead system as western canadian crude oil is carried on our lakehead system as far as chicago  and then transferred to the spearhead pipeline 
southern access extension in july  enbridge announced that it received support from shippers and the capp for its inch diameter southern access extension pipeline from flanagan to patoka  illinois 
the extension will broaden the reach of the enbridge lakehead mainline system to incremental markets accessible from the patoka hub 
this project is being undertaken by enbridge  however  we will benefit from the incremental volumes moving through our lakehead system to reach this extension 
project timing is being re evaluated as a result of delays in the regulatory process and the may denial by the ferc of enbridge s october filing seeking a declaratory order of the tariff rate structure for the pipeline 
enbridge remains committed to meeting the shippers need for transportation of crude oil from the chicago area to the patoka  illinois hub and is working with customers to reposition the project in a manner that is commercially appropriate for the market and includes a tolling structure acceptable to the ferc 
southern lights following completion of a successful open season in  enbridge initiated its southern lights project to construct a diluent pipeline from chicago to edmonton  alberta  canada to meet the growing demand for crude oil diluent required to transport the heavy oil and bitumen a thick  tar like form of oil being produced in increasing volumes from the alberta oil sands 
we expect to benefit from increased heavy crude oil shipments  which will be facilitated by the diluent line 
the project involves the exchange of a mile section of pipeline we own  referred to as line  for a similar section of a new pipeline to be constructed as part of the project 
in addition  this project involves a reconfiguration of our light crude mainline system which will provide an additional  bpd of effective capacity at no cost to us 
in february  the neb issued its approval and  in may  the canadian government also issued its governor in council gic approval for the canadian portion of the southern lights project  which allowed construction to commence 
enbridge has filed the majority of necessary applications for the united states portion of the project with united states federal and state regulatory agencies 
these processes are expected to be resolved in the first half of  enabling construction for the remaining us portion of the project to commence in enbridge filed a petition for declaratory order with the ferc setting forth the rate structure for establishing tolls and the proposed swap of line discussed above  which the ferc approved in late december in conjunction with our southern access project  the southern lights project has been allowed the right to exercise eminent domain for right of way in illinois 
construction and right of way acquisition related to this project continues in tandem with the southern access project

the initiative  as envisioned  involves the reversal of the bp pipeline system between flanagan and cushing  as well as the construction of a new pipeline between cushing and houston  texas 
the scope of the project provides for a pipeline system with over  bpd of new capacity between flanagan and cushing and approximately  bpd of capacity between cushing and houston 
enbridge is currently working with bp to develop commercial terms to present to a targeted list of potential shippers to solicit binding support prior to launching an open season in the target in service date for this pipeline system is late other matters in september  the alberta royalty review panel issued its recommendations to the government of the province of alberta calling for the adoption of measures to increase the alberta government s share of revenues from oil sands development 
a majority of the recommendations of the report were subsequently adopted by the alberta government and became effective january  these measures may impact how oil sands developers evaluate future projects and this may reduce the level of future volumes we expect to flow through the enbridge lakehead mainline system

we derive revenue in our natural gas segment from the following types of arrangements fee based arrangements under a fee based contract  we receive a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transporting raw natural gas and providing other similar services 
these revenues correspond with the volumes and types of services provided and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
revenues of our natural gas segment that are derived from transmission services consist of reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas on both our ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems and some of our intrastate pipeline systems 
customers paying these fees typically pay a reservation fee each month to reserve capacity plus a nominal commodity charge based on actual transmission volumes 
additional revenues from our intrastate pipelines are derived from the bundled sales of natural gas and transmission services 
other arrangements we also use other types of arrangements to derive revenues for our natural gas segment 
these arrangements expose us to commodity price risk  which we substantially mitigate with offsetting physical purchases and sales and by the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge open positions 
we hedge a significant amount of our exposure to commodity price risk to support the stability of our cash flows 
refer to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report for more information about the derivative activities we use to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk 
we categorize our other types of arrangements as follows percentage of liquids contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of ngls and condensate extracted from natural gas that requires processing  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 
this contract structure is similar to percentage of proceeds arrangements except that we only receive a percentage of the ngls and condensate 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  we gather or purchase raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased natural gas is consumed during processing 
we extract and retain the ngls produced during processing for our own account  which we sell at market prices 
in instances where we purchase raw gas at the wellhead  we also sell for our own account at market prices  the resulting residue gas 
in those instances when we gather and process raw natural gas for the account of the producer  we must return to the producer residue gas with an energy content equivalent to the original raw natural gas we received as measured in british thermal units  or btu 
percentage of index contracts under these contracts  we purchase raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index price 
we then resell the natural gas  generally for the index price  keeping the difference as our fee 
percentage of proceeds contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of the natural gas and ngls we process in the form of residue natural gas  ngls  condensate and sulfur  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 
under the terms of each of these contract structures  we retain a portion of the natural gas and ngls as our fee in exchange for providing these producers with our services 
we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge approximately to percent of our near term exposure to commodity prices associated with the in kind compensation we receive for our services

many of the derivative financial instruments we use do not qualify for hedge accounting 
as a result we record the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting in our operating results 
this accounting treatment produces unrealized non cash gains and losses in our reported operating results that can be significant during periods when the commodity price environment is volatile 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment contributed million of operating income for the year ended december   an increase of million from the million contributed in the corresponding period of the following discussion presents the primary factors affecting the operating income of our natural gas business for the year ended december  as compared with the same period of million of unrealized  non cash mark to market net gains from derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 as compared with losses of million for the same period of  volume growth associated with the substantial completion of our east texas natural gas system expansion and extension  referred to as the clarity project  coupled with strong production from the bossier trend  granite wash and barnett shale formations  reduced revenues of approximately million associated with the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike in the third and fourth quarters of  when third party facilities downstream of our operations were damaged or without power 
physical damage to our facilities was minimal with certain of our natural gas assets incurring capital and operating costs of approximately million for repairs 
our three major natural gas systems have been returned to pre hurricane levels  increased use of fee based arrangements to compensate for our services at lower margins relative to contract structures that contain commodity price risk  declines in the prices of natural gas and ngls from july to december  decreased the value of our in kind natural gas imbalance receivables and produced non cash charges to reduce the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to net realizable value  and increased workforce  repair and maintenance  materials and supplies  property taxes and depreciation associated with our system growth 
the operating income of our natural gas segment for the year ended december  was positively affected by unrealized non cash  mark to market net gains of million  representing an increase of million from the million of losses we recorded for the same period of during the second half of  significant declines in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas  ngls and condensate produced non cash  mark to market net gains in our portfolio of derivative instruments 
the declining price environment that was prevalent during the second half of was not present during most of the year ended december  we expect the net mark to market gains to be offset when the related physical transactions are settled 
we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices in the near term on approximately to percent of the natural gas  ngls and condensate we expect to receive as compensation for our services 
as a result of this unhedged commodity price exposure  our margins increase when the prices of these commodities are rising and decrease when the prices are declining 
despite the substantial fluctuations in commodity prices during  an overall favorable pricing environment contributed to higher average prices for the sale of natural gas and ngls we receive as in kind payment for our services 
the improved margins were also enhanced by an approximate increase in average daily volumes on our natural gas systems 
the increase in average daily volume of our natural gas business is directly attributable to the significant investments we have made to expand the capacity and service capability of

we completed the following projects during the years ended december  and  which have contributed to the increase in average daily volumes and operating results of our major natural gas systems in may our expansion of the aker treating plant on our east texas system was completed and placed into service adding million cubic feet per day  or mmcf d  of treating capacity 
the million expansion and extension of our east texas natural gas system  referred to as the clarity project  is substantially complete and includes the goodrich compressor station was constructed and placed into service in december  a inch diameter pipeline segment that extends from kountze  texas to orange county  texas was placed into service in july  a inch segment from orange county  texas to a downstream interconnect near beaumont  texas enabling deliveries into the interconnect was placed into service in december  construction of the orange county  texas compressor station is nearly complete and is expected to be placed into service in february  a inch diameter pipeline that extends from goodrich to kountze was completed in october  which enables deliveries into a major interstate pipeline  a inch diameter pipeline that extends from an interconnect with our existing pipeline at bethel  texas to crockett was completed and placed into service in late july  a inch diameter pipeline in close proximity to our marquez treating facility was completed and placed into service in june  a inch diameter pipeline that runs from the marquez treating facility to crockett  texas and the inch diameter pipeline that runs from crockett to goodrich  texas were both completed and placed into service in late march  and the marquez treating plant with capacity of approximately mmcf d and additional pipeline capacity to the existing southeast section of this area was completed and placed into service in march we expect to finish the final compression station during the first quarter of the total added capacity related to this project when completed will approximate mmcf d 
in the first quarter of we completed construction of a mile  inch diameter pipeline from a lateral on our east texas system to gather additional production being developed in east texas 
construction of the weatherford gas processing facility within our north texas system was completed in september with a processing capacity of approximately mmcf d 
at the end of  additional processing capacity was added to the weatherford processing facility to increase its capacity from mmcf day to mmcf day 
in the latter half of  we completed construction of three hydrocarbon dewpoint control facilities on our east texas system to add processing capacity to meet the increasingly more stringent pipeline gas quality specifications 
these facilities have a cumulative capacity of mmcf d and obtain a significant portion of their revenues from fees rather than keep whole processing or percentage of liquids revenues 
construction of the hidetown processing facility on our anadarko system with approximate capacity of mmcf d was completed and placed into service at the end of april during the second quarter of  we refurbished our zybach processing plant to address operational inefficiencies experienced by the plant 
as a result of the service and repairs  processing volumes were restored to expected levels 
with the expansions we completed in and  we are now able to provide additional gathering  processing  treating and transportation services for our customers which has contributed to our volume growth 
table of contents 
index to financial statements for the year ended december  volume and revenue growth is also the result of additional wellhead supply contracts and robust drilling activity in the areas served by our natural gas business  primarily the bossier trend  barnett shale and granite wash areas 
we expect the volumes on our major natural gas systems to continue increasing throughout the upcoming year as a result of our investments to expand the capacity of our systems to provide gathering  processing and transportation services to meet the needs of producers in the areas we serve 
another factor that could lead to more demand on our services is the recent discovery of the haynesville shale in western louisiana and eastern texas 
the haynesville shale has the potential of being the largest natural gas discovery in the united states 
if proven  the discovery could create more drilling activity around our east texas system increasing the demand for our services 
a factor that may moderate increased demand in fiscal year is the deteriorated state of the global economy 
weak demand together with low commodity prices may lead to the inability of many companies to raise the necessary capital to engage in new projects 
the inability to obtain the necessary funding for new capital projects could decrease the amount of new natural gas production in the areas we serve 
the processing margins we derive from processing natural gas under keep whole arrangements that exist within our east texas  north texas and anadarko systems declined percent for the year ended december  in relation to the same period of operating income derived from keep whole processing arrangements for the year ended december  was million  representing a decrease of million from the million we produced for the same period in during the last half of  ngl and crude oil prices began to decline faster than natural gas prices  which have the effect of reducing revenue we derive from our processing assets 
in addition we continue to experience a trend of replacing or renegotiating some of our existing keep whole contracts with percentage of liquids  or pol  type contracts and other similar arrangements 
this trend should reduce our exposure to the commodity price spread between natural gas and ngls for the portion of the operating income we derive from processing natural gas under keep whole arrangements 
during the months from september to december  we experienced operational disruptions to our onshore and offshore natural gas facilities as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike 
our facilities in texas and louisiana sustained minimal physical damage from the hurricanes  although some of our natural gas systems had lower throughput and revenues for the months of september through december due to the inability of third party downstream facilities to receive deliveries of our natural gas and ngls 
these temporary disruptions curtailed our ability to gather unprocessed natural gas at our processing plants  transport natural gas to markets  and to access natural gas liquids we own at third party facilities held under force majeure 
our current estimate of lost revenue associated with the hurricanes approximates million 
in addition we incurred capital and operating costs of approximately million for repairs to our damaged facilities in the year ended december  we do not anticipate recovery of any of these losses through insurance 
the majority of our facilities returned to normal operation by the end of september as a result of the significant price erosion in daily natural gas prices in the second half of  we recorded million of revaluation losses with respect to our in kind natural gas imbalances 
ngl prices also experienced similar declines in prices which required us to recognize million of charges to reduce the cost basis of our ngls 
operating and administrative costs of our natural gas segment were million greater for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of increased workforce related costs associated with the expansion of our systems  maintenance activities and other costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
our general partner charges us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel that are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
in addition we have experienced an increase in outside contract labor cost  given the high demand and competitive rates within our industry as a result of pipeline expansions across the areas we serve 
materials  supplies and other costs along with repair and maintenance costs were higher predominantly due to the increase in volumes and expansion of our natural gas systems 
repair and maintenance costs include compressor maintenance  downtime for routine and unscheduled maintenance  pipeline integrity costs and other similar items that have increased with the expansion of our natural gas systems 
we expect workforce related

the acquisition was necessitated by the growing supply of ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide from our processing facilities  as well as the need to better serve our us gulf coast customers 
the operations of the newly acquired truck fleet increased our operating and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment produced million of operating income for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the million of operating income generated during the prior year 
operating income in included unrealized  non cash mark to market net losses from our derivative activities totaling million which are million more than the million of net losses we recorded in the same period of also contributing to operating income were volume increases  improved pricing for our services and greater processing margins  which represent revenues less the cost of natural gas purchased for processing 
partially offsetting these increases in operating income were higher operating costs and depreciation 
the operating income of our natural gas segment for the year ended december  was negatively affected by unrealized non cash  mark to market net losses of million from our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
these losses were predominantly the result of hedges placed on the optional processing we perform on our three major systems which do not qualify for hedge accounting

we completed the necessary repairs and modifications during april and the plant operated as expected throughout the remainder of natural gas measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines 
the quantification and resolution of measurement losses is complicated by several factors including varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems  changes in weather temperatures and variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies 
during the first quarter  we identified operating conditions on our gathering systems which contributed to an increase in measurement losses 
we have since installed separator equipment to identify and eliminate free water in the natural gas streams  one of the underlying causes for the increase in measurement losses during for the year ended december   we estimate that measurement losses resulted in approximately million of additional cost to our natural gas systems relative to the same period of a portion of our natural gas segment is exposed to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices associated with the percentage of proceeds  percentage of liquids  and percentage of index contracts that we negotiate with producers 
under the terms of these contracts  we retain a portion of the natural gas and ngls we process in exchange for providing these producers with our services 
in order to protect our unitholders from the volatility in cash flows that can result from fluctuations in commodity prices  we enter into derivative financial instruments to fix the sales price of the natural gas and ngls we anticipate receiving under the terms of these contracts 
as a result of entering into these derivative financial instruments  we have largely fixed the amount of cash that we will pay for natural gas and receive in the future when we sell the processed natural gas and ngls  although the market price of these commodities will continue to fluctuate during that time 
another significant portion of the revenue we receive is derived from fees charged for gathering and treating of natural gas volumes and other related services which are not directly dependent on commodity prices 
operating and administrative costs associated with our natural gas segment were million  or percent  greater for than  primarily as a result of increased workforce related cost associated with the expansion of our systems  maintenance activities and other costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
our workforce related costs increased for the year ended december  over the same period in due to the additional resources and related benefit costs we are charged for the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our existing assets and the expansion of our natural gas operations 
in addition  our general partner charges us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel that are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
the portion of compensation and related costs we are charged is dependent upon such items as estimated time spent  miles of pipe and headcount 
in addition we have experienced an increase in outside contract labor cost  given the high demand and competitive rates within our industry as a result of continuous pipeline expansions across the areas we serve 
our materials and supplies coupled with repair and maintenance costs increased for the year ended december  over the same period in  predominantly due to the increase in volumes and expansion of our natural gas systems 
materials  supplies and other costs include chemicals used in our processing activities  materials purchased for repair and maintenance purposes  utility costs to run our plants  pumps and other similar costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
repair and maintenance costs include compressor maintenance  downtime for routine and unscheduled maintenance  pipeline integrity costs and other similar items that have increased with the expansion of our existing natural gas systems 
an example of these increasing costs is methanol  a chemical used on our systems which cost per gallon in at the end of  this chemical had risen in cost to per gallon 
welders  inspectors and other skilled laborers and technicians hourly labor costs have increased in cost by amounts well in excess of the rate of overall inflation as measured by the cpi or ppi inflation index 
we expect our operating and administrative costs will continue to increase in future periods as greater volumes of natural gas flow through our systems and we continue to expand our natural gas operations 
our depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased by approximately million over the same period in  primarily as a result of capital projects completed and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements placed in service during late and throughout we expect our depreciation expense to continue to increase as we complete capital projects related to our continued expansion of our natural gas operations 
future prospects for natural gas volatility in the capital markets will necessitate a less aggressive capital program in our natural gas business in the near term 
during this period of volatility we will continue to focus our efforts primarily on development of our existing pipeline systems 
we have evaluated all of our planned future natural gas projects and have written off approximately million of projects that were uneconomic at december  we have also delayed other projects until such time that capital becomes available at more economical costs for those projects with sufficient commercial support 
we will opportunistically evaluate strategic prospects to further expand the service capabilities of our existing system 
we may also pursue opportunities to divest any non strategic natural gas assets as conditions warrant 
in january  we sold the member interests of our utos system for minimal consideration to enbridge offshore gas transportation  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of enbridge 
our utos system transports natural gas from offshore platforms on a fee for service basis to other pipelines onshore for further delivery and does not have long term contracts 
the utos system was not considered strategic to the ongoing operations of the partnership and was an insignificant contributor to the financial results of our natural gas segment 
results of our natural gas business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas we serve 
we expect the rapid decline in natural gas and ngl prices during the second half of to reduce exploration and production activity by natural gas producers in the near term  which may diminish the growth rate of our natural gas business 
specifically  we expect the volumes on our anadarko system to decline from historic levels due to weak commodity prices in the midcontinent region of the united states among other economic factors 
however  our east texas and north texas systems are located in two areas where we believe producers are likely to remain active due to the higher probability of success associated with resource developments in these areas 
another factor that could lead to additional demand for the services of our east texas system is the recent natural gas discovery in the haynesville shale play located in western louisiana and eastern texas 
the haynesville shale has the potential of being the largest natural gas discovery in the united states 
if proven  the discovery could create more drilling activity around our east texas system increasing the demand for our services 
we believe these factors should temper the impact of lower natural gas production that generally results from a reduction in drilling activity 
shelby county loop and compression we commenced construction during the third quarter of to add compression at the carthage hub and on the shelby county lateral sections of our east texas system 
we have also initiated construction to increase the capacity of the east texas system in the area by installing approximately miles of inch pipeline 
we expect to complete this project during at an approximate cost of million 
commercial terms for this project predominately involve firm volume commitments from customers 
other matters a number of new interstate natural gas transportation pipelines are being constructed that may alter the landscape for interstate transportation of natural gas 
these newly constructed pipelines could affect the operating results of certain of our existing market based interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines  primarily the alatenn  midla  and mlgt systems 
conversely  our supply based gathering systems may benefit from enhanced capacity out of our gathering areas 
we completed negotiations with a major customer of our midla mainline transmission system for the renewal of a contract that expired in august for another five year term 
unlike our gathering systems  our interstate pipelines have a concentration of customers 
as such they are more susceptible to contract loss or competition and potentially the inability to recover the carrying value of their noncurrent assets  which approximate million for the midla system and million of the alatenn system at december

index to financial statements in november  we sold our kansas pipeline system  or kpc  to an unrelated party for million in cash  subject to adjustments for working capital items 
kpc is an interstate natural gas transmission system  which serves the wichita  kansas and kansas city  kansas markets and includes approximately  miles of pipeline ranging in diameter from to inches  along with three compressor stations 
kpc represented a business within our natural gas segment that we did not consider strategic to the ongoing central operations of our core natural gas segment assets 
the operating results of the kpc system were not material to our consolidated operating results or those of our natural gas segment for the years ended december   and we recognized a gain of million on the sale of kpc  which is presented in income from discontinued operations 
marketing the following table sets forth the operating results for the marketing segment assets for the periods presented for the year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues cost of natural gas operating and administrative depreciation and amortization operating expenses operating income loss our marketing business derives a majority of its operating income from selling natural gas received from producers on our natural gas segment pipeline assets to customers requiring the natural gas 
a majority of the natural gas we purchase is produced in texas markets where we previously had limited physical access to the primary interstate pipeline delivery points  or hubs  such as the houston ship channel 
as a result of the completed segments of our natural gas system expansions and other initiatives during and  our marketing business now has access to several interstate natural gas pipelines  which it can use to transport natural gas to primary markets where it can be sold at more favorable prices 
our marketing business is exposed to commodity price fluctuations because the natural gas purchased by our marketing business is generally priced using an index that is different from the pricing index at which the gas is sold 
this price exposure arises from the relative difference in natural gas prices between the contracted index at which the natural gas is purchased and the index under which it is sold  otherwise known as the spread 
the spread can vary significantly due to local supply and demand factors 
wherever possible  this pricing exposure is economically hedged using derivative financial instruments 
however  the structure of these economic hedges often precludes our use of hedge accounting under the requirements of sfas no 
 which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
in addition to the market access provided by our intrastate natural gas pipelines  our marketing business also contracts for firm transportation capacity on third party interstate and intrastate pipelines to allow access to additional markets 
to offset the demand charges associated with these transportation agreements  we look for market conditions that allow us to lock in the price differential or spread between the pipeline receipt point and pipeline delivery point 
this allows our marketing business to lock in a fixed sales margin inclusive of pipeline demand charges 
we accomplish this by transacting basis swaps between the index where the natural gas is purchased and the index where the natural gas is sold 
by transacting a basis swap between those two indices  we can effectively lock in a margin on the combined natural gas purchase and the natural gas sale  mitigating the demand charges on these transportation agreements and limiting the partnership s exposure to cash flow volatility that could arise in markets where the transporting the natural gas becomes uneconomical 
however  the structure of these transactions precludes our use of hedge accounting under the requirements of sfas no 
 which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition to natural gas basis swaps  we contract for storage to assist with balancing natural gas supply and end use market sales 
in order to mitigate the absolute price differential between the cost of injected natural gas and withdrawn natural gas  as well as storage fees  the injection and withdrawal price differential  or spread  is hedged by buying fixed price swaps for the forecasted injection periods and selling fixed price swaps for the forecasted withdrawal periods 
when the injection and withdrawal spread increases or decreases in value as a result of market price movements  we can earn additional profit through the optimization of those hedges in both the forward and daily markets 
although all of these hedge strategies are sound economic hedging techniques  these types of financial transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under the sfas no 
guidelines 
as such  the non qualified hedges are accounted for on a mark to market basis  and the periodic change in their market value  although non cash  will impact our operating results 
natural gas purchased and sold by our marketing segment is priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at their request  we will enter into long term  fixed price purchase or sales contracts with our customers and generally will enter into offsetting hedged positions under the same or similar terms 
marketing pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store and transport natural gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage  or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts  and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating income of our marketing segment declined to million for the year ended december  from income of million for the corresponding period in included in the operating income for the year ended december  are approximately million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market losses associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 compared to the million of unrealized mark to market losses for the comparable period of the unrealized  mark to market losses for the year ended december  result from decreases in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas from december  we expect these net mark to market losses to be offset when the related physical transactions are settled 
operating income for the year ended december  was also negatively affected by non cash charges of million we recorded to reduce the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to net realizable value  which is million more than the million non cash charge we recorded for the same period of natural gas and ngl prices declined significantly from the record highs experienced in july of due to our hedging structures  we expect that a majority of these charges will be offset by future financial transactions that will settle at the time the natural gas inventory is sold 
the operating and administrative expenses of our marketing business are slightly more for the year ended december  as compared with the same period of due to additional workforce related costs associated with the employees and related benefits for personnel that are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our marketing business has benefited from the increased access to preferred natural gas markets resulting from our natural gas system expansions and other initiatives 
although the operating income of our marketing segment for the year ended december  of million is million lower than the million for the year ended december   the change is primarily due to the million decrease in unrealized  non cash mark to market gains associated with our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of unrealized mark to market losses from our derivative activities as compared with million of unrealized

index to financial statements mark to market gains for the year ended december  the unrealized  mark to market losses for the year ended december   are the result of modest increases in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas from december  during the year ended december   declines in the forward and daily market prices of natural gas from the historically high prices existing at december  produced significant unrealized mark to market gains in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
we expect the unrealized mark to market gains and losses associated with our portfolio of derivative financial instruments to be offset when the related physical transactions are settled 
refer to the discussions included in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to our financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
the operating results of our marketing business for the year ended december  also include gains of approximately million that we realized upon the sale of natural gas inventory  including approximately million of gains from the settlement of derivative financial instruments hedging our natural gas inventory 
partially offsetting these gains are non cash charges of million that we recorded to reduce the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to net realizable value  which is million less than the million non cash charges we recorded during the year ended december  the market price for natural gas in various storage locations may experience declines during the year from the prices at which the inventory was purchased 
due to our hedging structures  we expect that a majority of these charges will be offset by future financial transactions that will settle at the time the natural gas inventory is sold 
corporate year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the corresponding period in the increases are primarily the result of a higher weighted average debt balance associated with the following debt issuances in and million of our senior notes in december  million of our senior notes in april  million of our senior notes in april  million of our junior subordinated notes in september  and million of our zero coupon senior notes in august our weighted average interest rate is for the year ended december  as compared with our weighted average interest rate of for the same period in further contributing to the increase in interest expense is the million decrease in interest capitalized to our construction projects for the year ended december  from the same period in for the year ended december  and  our interest cost was comprised of the following for the year ended december  dollars in millions interest expense interest capitalized interest cost incurred interest paid we are not a taxable entity for us federal income tax purposes or for the majority of states that impose an income tax 
these taxes on our net income are generally borne by our unitholders through the allocation of taxable income

liquidity and capital resources impact of current economic crisis multiple events during  including a deep global recession that was largely precipitated by the financial sector of the global economy  have effectively restricted current liquidity within the capital markets throughout the united states and around the world 
despite efforts by treasury and banking regulators to provide liquidity  the capital markets currently remain constrained 
as evidenced by our december debt offering  we have the ability to access the capital markets  however  the prices at which we can access capital are substantially higher than the prices we incurred for similar offerings in recent years 
we expect our cost of capital to remain historically high over the next twelve months and possibly longer should capital markets remain constrained 
as a result  we expect to selectively access the capital markets as necessary to fund our internal growth projects and maintain our investment grade credit rating 
our near term focus is to ensure we have sufficient liquidity to fund our growth programs and maintain our credit rating  while continuing the present distribution rate to our unitholders 
the current economic crisis has created a challenging operating environment for us to maintain our liquidity and operating cash flows at levels consistent with the recent past while maintaining the present distribution rate to our unitholders 
we intend to move forward with our commercially supported internal growth projects  although our capital spending  particularly on the natural gas side of our business  will be reduced to minimize our capital raising requirements 
our ability to access the capital markets to fund new projects in the future at prices that make the proposed projects accretive is likely to be limited 
we may revise the timing and scope of other projects as necessary to adapt to existing economic conditions and the incremental benefits expected to accrue to our unitholders from our expansion activities are likely to be decreased by substantial cost of capital increases during this period

margin requirements associated with our derivative transactions are generally supported by letters of credit issued under our credit facility 
our current business strategy emphasizes developing and expanding our existing liquids and natural gas businesses with less focus on acquisitions 
our need for investment capital to fund our expansion projects  make acquisitions of new assets and businesses and to retire maturing or callable debt obligations is expected to be funded from several sources 
we anticipate initially funding long term cash requirements for expansion projects and acquisitions first from operating cash flows  second  from borrowings under our credit facility  and from borrowings under our credit agreement with enbridge us inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of enbridge and from other potential sources of capital 
likewise  we anticipate initially retiring our maturing and callable debt with similar borrowings on these existing facilities 
we expect to obtain permanent financing through the issuance of additional equity and debt securities  which we will use to repay amounts initially drawn to fund these activities 
capital resources equity and debt securities execution of our growth strategy and completion of our planned construction projects contemplate our accessing the public and private equity and credit markets to obtain the capital necessary to fund these projects 
we have issued securities generating proceeds in excess of billion over the past three years through the issuance of a balanced combination of debt and equity securities to fund our expansion projects 
our planned internal growth projects will require additional permanent capital and continue to require us to bear the cost of constructing these new assets before we begin to realize a return on them 
prevailing market conditions may limit our ability and willingness to complete future debt and equity offerings while the capital markets remain constrained and costs are high 
the timing of any future debt and equity offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates  our financial condition and our credit rating at the time
