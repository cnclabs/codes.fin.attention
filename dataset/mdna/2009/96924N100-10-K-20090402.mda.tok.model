item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a provider of outsourced services to small and mid sized public agencies in california and other western states 
outsourcing enables these agencies to provide a wide range of specialized services  without having to incur and maintain the overhead necessary to develop staffing in house 
we provide a broad range of services to public agencies and to a lesser extent  private industry  including civil engineering  building and safety services  geotechnical engineering  energy efficiency consulting financial and economic consulting  and disaster preparedness and homeland security 
we operate our business through a network of offices located throughout california and other western states and had a staff of as of january  that includes licensed engineers and other professionals 
we ranked out of top design firms in engineering news record s design survey 
our core clients are public agencies in communities with populations ranging from  to  people 
we believe communities of this size are underserved by large outsourcing companies that tend to focus on securing large federal and state projects  as well as projects for the private sector 
we seek to establish close working relationships with our public agency clients and  over time  to expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to them 
while we currently serve communities throughout the country  our business is concentrated in california and neighboring states 
we provide services to approximately of the cities and over of the counties in california 
we also serve special districts  school districts  a range of public agencies  and to a lesser extent  private industry 
prior to our initial public offering in november  we were taxed as an s corporation for purposes of federal and state income taxes 
as a result of the offering  our s corporation status terminated and we are now taxed as a c corporation under federal and state tax laws 
in fiscal year  we recognized a net deferred income tax liability of million resulting from the termination of our s corporation status 
willdan group  inc is a delaware corporation formed in for the purpose of effecting the reincorporation of the willdan group of companies  a california corporation  formed in to serve as our holding company 
the reincorporation was completed effective june  we were founded over years ago  and today consist of a family of wholly owned companies that operate within the following segments for financial reporting purposes engineering services 
our engineering services segment includes the operations of our subsidiaries  willdan engineering  willdan geotechnical  willdan energy solutions  willdan resource solutions and public agency resources pars 
these businesses collectively provide engineering related services  geotechnical engineering services  environmental engineering and environmental related services and energy efficiency  water conservation  sustainability and renewable energy services to public agencies and  to a lesser extent  private industry 
additionally  pars primarily provides staffing to willdan engineering 
willdan engineering is our largest subsidiary and currently represents our core business

contract revenue for our homeland security services segment represented and of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
recent developments general economic conditions have recently declined due to a number of factors including slower economic activity  a lack of available credit  decreased consumer confidence and reduced corporate profits and capital spending 
these conditions have led to a slowdown in construction  particularly residential housing construction  in the western united states 
as a result of this slowdown  our engineering services segment has suffered declines in revenue and we have made several workforce reductions in order to align resources  primarily human capital  to workload 
additionally  we have terminated and or abandoned five facility leases  subleased portions of two facilities and reduced the size of an additional facility lease in order to reduce costs 
we believe that the reductions in workforce and facility leases achieved through january  will be sufficient to align resources with future demand for our services 
however  should the economic slowdown worsen  we will need to evaluate further reductions in headcount and facilities in geographic areas that are underperforming 
we will also continue to focus on reducing discretionary expenditures and the efficient procurement of necessary services 
declining revenue resulting from the economic conditions discussed above also contributed to us having two consecutive fiscal quarters with net income after taxes of less than  which violated one of the covenants in our revolving credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo for the quarter ended september  wells fargo agreed to waive this default for the quarter ended september   but in connection with such waiver  we amended the credit agreement to reduce the aggregate revolving loan commitment from million to million and amend certain financial covenants 
for the year ended january   we also failed to meet our maximum net loss before tax covenant 
in march  wells fargo agreed to waive this default and eliminate or modify certain financial covenants in exchange for our agreement to cash collateralize the commitment and increase pricing 
the terms of our amended credit agreement are discussed in more detail below under liquidity and capital resources outstanding indebtedness 
while we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under our amended credit facility with wells fargo will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for the next months  if we do experience a cash flow shortage or violate the current terms of our credit agreement  we may have difficulty obtaining additional funds on favorable terms  if at all  in the current credit market 
components of income and expense contract revenue we enter into contracts with our clients that contain three principal types of pricing provisions fixed price  time and materials and unit based 
contract revenue on our fixed price contracts is 
table of contents determined on the percentage of completion method based generally on the ratio of direct costs incurred to date to estimated total direct costs at completion 
many of our fixed price contracts are relatively short in duration  thereby lowering the risks of not properly estimating the percent complete 
revenue on our time and materials and unit based contracts are recognized as the work is performed in accordance with specific terms of the contract 
approximately half of our contracts are based on contractual rates per hour plus costs incurred 
some of these contracts include maximum contract prices  but the majority of these contracts are not expected to exceed the maximum 
adjustments to contract cost estimates are made in the periods in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
when the revised estimate indicates a loss  such loss is provided for currently in its entirety 
claims revenue is recognized only upon resolution of the claim 
change orders in dispute are evaluated as claims 
costs related to unpriced change orders are expensed when incurred and recognition of the related contract revenue is based on an evaluation of the probability of recovery of the costs 
estimated profit is recognized for unpriced change orders if realization of the expected price of the change order is assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
direct costs of contract revenue direct costs of contract revenue consist primarily of that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages that has been incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue also include production expenses  subconsultant services and other expenses that are incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue exclude depreciation and amortization  that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts  vacations  holidays and other time not spent directly generating revenue under existing contracts 
such costs are included in general and administrative expenses 
additionally  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefit costs for all of our personnel are included in general and administrative expenses since no allocation of these costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue 
no allocation of facilities costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue nor is depreciation and amortization allocated to direct costs 
we expense direct costs of contract revenue when incurred 
as a firm that provides multiple and diverse outsourced services  we do not believe gross margin is a consistent or appropriate indicator of our performance and therefore we do not use this measure as construction contractors and other types of consulting firms may 
other companies may classify as direct costs of contract revenue some of the costs that we classify as general and administrative expenses 
as a result  our direct costs of contract revenue may not be comparable to direct costs for other companies  either as a line item expense or as a percentage of contract revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staffs  other marketing expenses  management and administrative personnel costs  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefits for all of our employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of contract revenue for those employees who provide our services 
general and administrative expenses also include facility costs  depreciation and amortization  professional services  legal and accounting fees and administrative operating costs 
within general and administrative expenses  other includes expenses such as professional services  legal and accounting  computer costs  travel and entertainment and marketing costs 
we expense general and administrative costs when incurred 
until november  we had not operated as a public company 
as a public company  we have and will continue to incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company  and we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as a result 
our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with the requirements of being a public company 
moreover  rules and regulations for public companies have 
table of contents increased our legal and financial compliance costs and has made some activities more time consuming and costly 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
to prepare these financial statements in conformity with gaap  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of this report 
contract accounting applying the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenue requires us to estimate the indicated outcome of our long term contracts 
we forecast such outcomes to the best of our knowledge and belief of current and expected conditions and our expected course of action 
differences between our estimates and actual results often occur resulting in changes to reported revenue and earnings 
such changes could have a material effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based upon our review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
our credit risk is minimal with governmental entities 
account receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
for further information on the types of contracts under which we perform our services  see business contract structure elsewhere in this report 
goodwill the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
requires that we test goodwill  at least annually  for possible impairment 
accordingly  we complete our annual testing of goodwill as of the last day of the first month of our fourth fiscal quarter each year to determine whether there is impairment 
in addition to our annual test  we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill 
we recognized impairment charges for fiscal year related to our homeland security services reporting unit 
our homeland security services reporting unit had no remaining goodwill following this impairment charge 
we did not recognize any impairment charges in fiscal years and we test our goodwill for impairment at the level of our reporting units  which are components of our operating segments 
the reporting units that have material amounts of goodwill are willdan energy solutions  which is part of our engineering services segment  and willdan financial services  which constitutes our public finance services segment 
the process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units 
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  we have historically used an income approach based on a multiple of historical cash flows  management s estimates of future cash flows and other market data 
in fiscal year  we 
table of contents expanded our methodology to include a market approach based upon multiples of ebitda earned by similar public companies 
for our fiscal year annual impairment test  we weighted the income approach and the market approach at and  respectively 
the income approach was given a higher weight because it has a more direct correlation to the specific economics of the reporting units than the market approach  which is based on multiples of companies that  although comparable  may not provide the same mix of services as our reporting units 
once the fair value is determined  we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value  we perform an additional assessment to determine the extent of the impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
in the event that the current implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment charge is recognized 
inherent in such fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates  including but not limited to assumptions about our future revenue  profitability and cash flows  our operational plans and our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations 
to the extent these assumptions are incorrect or economic conditions that would impact the future operations of our reporting units change  our goodwill may be deemed to be impaired  and an impairment charge could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation 
for example  if we experienced a decrease in the fair value of each of our reporting units that have goodwill from that determined during our annual impairment testing  we would require an impairment charge of approximately million 
accounting for claims against the company we record liabilities to claimants for probable and estimable claims on our consolidated balance sheet  which is included in accrued liabilities  and record a corresponding receivable from our insurance company for the portion of the claim that is probable of being covered by insurance  which is included in other receivables 
the estimated claim amount net of the amount estimated to be recoverable from the insurance company is included in our general and administrative expenses 
determining probability and estimating claim amounts is highly judgmental 
initial accruals and any subsequent changes in our estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

our contract revenue was million for the fiscal year ended january   with million attributable to the engineering services segment and million attributable to the public finance services segment 
our homeland security services segment generated million during this period 
consolidated contract revenue decreased million  or  from million in the fiscal year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to a decrease of million  or  in contract revenue of the engineering service segment  offset by increases of million  or  and million  or  in contract revenue of the public finance services and homeland security services segments  respectively 
our revenue for fiscal year 
table of contents also includes million of revenue since june from willdan energy solutions  which we acquired in june contract revenue of the engineering services segment has been significantly impacted by the decline in the california residential housing market and state and local government budget cuts 
a source of revenue in our engineering services segment is fees assessed for building permits 
since the second half of fiscal  we have experienced reductions in revenue from these fees because of the continuing slowdown in residential construction in the western united states 
the million decrease in contract revenue for the engineering services segment is net of million of revenue recognized by willdan energy solutions following our acquisition of willdan energy solutions in june our public finance services business  specifically district administration projects  tends to run counter cyclical to the residential housing market 
revenue in the public finance services segment increased primarily due to increased district formation services to fund infrastructure projects as well as increased delinquency management services in our district administration services 
revenue in the homeland security services segment has increased due to an increase in our emergency response training courses  particularly in southern california 
additionally  our homeland security services segment has expanded its service offerings beyond its traditional training services to include training exercises and management consulting services 
direct costs of contract revenue 
direct costs of contract revenue was million for the fiscal year ended january   with million attributable to the engineering services segment and million attributable to the public finance services segment 
the additional million is attributable to direct costs of contract revenue for our homeland security services segment 
direct costs of contract revenue increased million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended december  of this total increase  direct costs of contract revenue increased million  or  in the engineering services segment and million  or  in the public finance services segment 
the remaining million increase was attributable to the homeland security services segment 
the increase in direct costs of contract revenue for our engineering services segment is primarily due to increased salary  subconsultant and other direct costs related to willdan energy solutions which we acquired in june  offset by decreases in direct salary costs across other areas of the segment 
increases in direct costs of contract revenue for our public finance services and homeland security services segments were primarily the result of the increased volume of activity that generated the increased contract revenue previously discussed for these operating segments 
direct costs of contract revenue as a percentage of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended january  increased to from for the fiscal year ended december   primarily because contract revenue in our engineering services segment decreased at a higher rate than the direct costs of contract revenue attributable to this segment 
within direct costs of contract revenue  salaries and wages decreased to of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended january  from for the fiscal year ended december  comparing those same periods  subconsultant services increased to of contract revenue from of contract revenue 
subconsultant costs increased primarily due to our acquisition of willdan energy solutions which utilizes a higher percentage of subconsultants than our other subsidiaries 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to decreases in salaries and wages  payroll taxes and employee benefits and other general and administrative expenses 
the reduction in employee related costs primarily resulted from reductions in headcount and cost control measures 
the reduction in other general and administrative expenses related to cost control measures and reductions in professional service costs primarily related to the legal costs incurred during fiscal year for the settlement of the west hollywood litigation and lower professional fees during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year 
table of contents primarily because we had to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act for the first time in fiscal year the decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increases of million in amortization of acquired intangibles related to willdan energy solutions  million of lease abandonment costs and million of goodwill impairments 
fiscal year general and administrative expenses also included a million litigation accrual for the west hollywood litigation 
lease abandonment expense includes future rental obligations and other costs associated with leased space that is no longer utilized by us or sublease tenants 
as discussed above under components of income and expense direct costs of contract revenue  we do not allocate that portion of salaries and wages not related to time spent directly generating revenue to direct costs of contract revenue 
loss income from operations 
as a result of the above factors  loss from operations was million for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to income from operations of million for the fiscal year ended december  loss income from operations as a percentage of contract revenue decreased to for the fiscal year ended january   from for the fiscal year ended december  other income expense 
other income  net  decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million of income in the fiscal year ended december  this was due primarily to i a decrease in interest income of million resulting primarily from a reduction in average invested balances due to the purchase of willdan energy solutions  and ii an increase in interest expense of million related primarily to the inclusion in fiscal year of a reversal of million of accrued interest related to the west hollywood litigation that was settled without payment of interest 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit was million for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended december  net loss income 
as a result of the above factors  our net loss was million for the fiscal year ended january   compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal year compared to fiscal year contract revenue 
our contract revenue was million for fiscal year ended december   with million attributable to the engineering services segment and million attributable to the public finance services segment 
our homeland security services segment generated million during this period 
consolidated contract revenue increased million  or  from million in the fiscal year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase of million  or  and million  or  in contract revenue of the public finance services and homeland security services segments  respectively  offset by a decrease of million  or  in contract revenue of the engineering services segment 
revenue in the public finance services segment increased primarily due to increased district formation services to fund infrastructure projects as well as increased delinquency management services in our district administration services 
revenue in homeland security services has increased due to an increase in our emergency response training courses  particularly in southern california 
our engineering services segment decline was due in part to the slowdown in residential housing construction in the western united states 
a source of revenue in our engineering services segment is fees assessed for building permits 
in the latter part of fiscal year and throughout fiscal year  we experienced a reduction in revenue from these fees because of the downturn in the housing market 

table of contents direct costs of contract revenue 
direct costs of contract revenue was million for the fiscal year ended december   with million attributable to the engineering services segment and million attributable to the public finance services segment 
the additional million is attributable to direct costs of contract revenue for our homeland security services segment 
direct costs of contract revenue increased million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended december  of this total increase  direct costs of contract revenue increased million  or  in the engineering services segment and million  or  in the public finance services segment 
the remaining million increase was attributable to the homeland security services segment 
direct costs of contract revenue as a percentage of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended december  increased to from for the fiscal year ended december   primarily because our direct costs of contract revenue increased without a corresponding increase in our revenue 
this is due in part to higher levels of non salaries and wages costs which are passed through to clients at a lower mark up than salaries and wages 
within direct costs of contract revenue  salaries and wages increased to of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended december  from for the fiscal year ended december  comparing those same periods  subconsultant services increased to of contract revenue from of contract revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  this was due primarily to increases of million and million in general and administrative expenses of the engineering services and homeland security services segments  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for the public finance services segment and unallocated corporate expenses remained flat 
the engineering services segment increase includes a million change in our litigation accrual as a result of the million charge in fiscal year for reversal of the million recovery of a prior indemnity claim recorded during fiscal year also included in our general and administrative expenses are the costs associated with management changes in the fiscal year ended december  these costs resulted in an increase of approximately million in expenses for the payment of severance and other employee benefits 
overall  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue increased to in the fiscal year ended december  from in the fiscal year ended december  the increases in general and administrative expenses also resulted from i an increase of approximately million  or  in other general and administrative expenses  which includes million of legal fees related to the settlement of the west hollywood litigation and ii an increase of million related to increased costs associated with being a public company  of which million related to costs associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the balance includes additional audit and legal fees and board of director fees 
additionally  approximately million of the increase to other general and administrative expenses resulted from increased insurance premiums  computer expenses and other costs associated with our increase in contract revenue offset by decreases in marketing expenses  bad debt expenses and other expenses of approximately million 
as discussed above under components of income and expense direct costs of contract revenue  we do not allocate that portion of salaries and wages not related to time spent directly generating revenue to direct costs of contract revenue 
income from operations 
as a result of the above factors  income from operations was million for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  income from operations as a percentage of contract revenue  decreased to in the fiscal year ended december  from in the prior year period 

table of contents other income expense 
other income expense  net  decreased by million  or  to million of income in the fiscal year ended december  from million of income in the fiscal ended december  this decrease was primarily due to million of life insurance proceeds received in as a result of the death of our former chief executive officer in may  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of approximately million primarily as a result of i the reversal of million of accrued interest payable associated with the west hollywood litigation settlement and ii an increase in interest income of approximately million from invested initial public offering proceeds 
income tax expense 
effective as of the first day of trading of our common stock  november   the s corporation status of our company and the qualified s subsidiary status of our subsidiaries terminated and thereafter we were subject to federal and state income taxes as a c corporation 
thus we were taxed at regular corporate rates during the fiscal year ended december  and the income tax expense for fiscal year and is not comparable 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  our net income was million for the fiscal year ended december   compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for at least the next months 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal year compared to cash flows used in operating activities of million for fiscal year and cash flows provided by operating activities of million for fiscal year the cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year were comparatively higher than in fiscal year due primarily to increased collection of accounts receivable and the payment of accrued liabilities related to the west hollywood litigation accrued in fiscal year  net of amounts paid for by our insurance company 
these increases were partially offset by decreases related to the net loss incurred in fiscal year compared to net income earned in fiscal year in the period  net cash provided by operating activities included million of life insurance proceeds received as a result of the death of our former chief executive officer in may cash flows from investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year over fiscal year resulted primarily from million used by the acquisition of willdan energy solutions  partially offset by cash provided by net sales of liquid investments 
the decrease of cash used in investing activities for fiscal year over fiscal year resulted primarily from the decrease in expenditures for equipment and leasehold improvements  partially offset by an increase of net purchases of liquid investments 
fiscal year included higher than historical levels of equipment and leasehold improvements purchases due to the establishment of new office locations and the relocation of existing office facilities  including our corporate offices 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million for fiscal year compared to cash flows used in financing activities of million for fiscal year and cash flows provided by financing activities million for fiscal year the decrease of cash used in financing activities for fiscal year over fiscal year resulted primarily from the fiscal year payment of million in distributions to holders of our redeemable common stock  partially offset by an increase in net payments of notes payable of million 
the fiscal year distribution was our final s corporation distribution to our stockholders and we used the proceeds from our initial public offering to pay this amount 
we will not make a similar distribution in the future because we can no longer elect to be treated as an s corporation 
the net change between fiscal years and for cash from financing activities is million  which is primarily the result of net proceeds of million received in fiscal from the sale of stock in our initial public offering and the exercise of the overallotment option  partially offset by a decrease of million in distributions paid to holders of our redeemable common stock 
outstanding indebtedness we currently have a revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  which was amended on march  we have also financed  from time to time  insurance premiums by entering into unsecured notes payable with insurance companies 
during our annual insurance renewals in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended january   we elected not to finance our insurance premiums for the upcoming fiscal year 
under the terms of our credit agreement with wells fargo  we can borrow up to million from time to time as may be limited by the covenants in the credit agreement as discussed below up to and until january  loans made under the revolving line of credit will accrue interest at either i the floating rate equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time or ii the fixed rate of above libor  at our election 
for prime rate loans  the interest rate will be adjusted when each prime rate change by the bank is announced and becomes effective 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement as of january  borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by all of our accounts receivable and other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory and equipment  including those of our subsidiaries 
in addition  borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by investment property we hold in a securities account at wells fargo that must at all times have a collateral value of at least million 
each of our subsidiaries except public agency resources and willdan resource solutions has signed an unconditional guaranty of our obligations under the agreements 

table of contents the credit agreement contains customary representations and affirmative covenants  including a covenant to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million at all times 
tangible net worth is defined in the credit agreement as stockholders equity less intangible assets and loans or advances to  or investments in  any related entities or individuals 
as of january   our tangible net worth as defined under our credit agreement was million 
at january   we were required to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million 
the covenant was amended on march  and we are currently required to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million 
tangible net worth is a supplemental measure used in our credit agreement 
if we do not maintain tangible net worth of at least million  wells fargo could choose to accelerate any loans then outstanding under the facility or refuse to make additional loans to us under the facility 
management therefore believes that presentation of tangible net worth as defined in the credit agreement is useful to investors because it helps them understand how our tangible net worth compares to the financial covenant contained in our credit agreement and whether we are close to violating such covenant 
management also reviews tangible net worth to ensure it will continue to have access to its financing sources 
tangible net worth is defined in the credit agreement as the aggregate of total stockholders equity less any intangible assets and less any loans or advances to  or investments in  any related entities or individuals 
this definition of tangible net worth may differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures 
this measure should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  such as stockholders equity 
tangible net worth is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to stockholders equity as an indicator of net worth or any other gaap measure 
the following is a reconciliation of stockholders equity to tangible net worth year ended january  stockholders equity goodwill and other intangibles  net related party loans  advances or investments tangible net worth prior to the amendment of the credit agreement in march  the credit agreement contained additional financial covenants  including minimum net income and maximum net loss covenants 
as discussed above in recent developments  we breached our minimum net income covenant for the quarter ended september  and  in exchange for wells fargo s waiver of this breach  we amended our credit agreement in december to reduce the amount available under the facility from million to million and to revise the financial covenants under the facility 
we also breached our maximum net loss covenant for the year ended january  by sustaining net losses before taxes greater than million 
in march  wells fargo waived this breach and eliminated or modified certain financial covenants in the credit agreement in exchange for increased pricing and additional collateral being provided 
the credit agreement also includes customary negative covenants  including a covenant that prohibits the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us or our subsidiaries other than purchase money indebtedness not to exceed million and indebtedness existing on the date of the credit agreement  and a covenant that prohibits payment of dividends on our stock and redemptions  repurchases or other acquisitions of our stock  provided that we can repurchase stock with an aggregate fair market value up to million in any calendar year 
in addition  the credit agreement includes customary events of default for a credit facility 
upon a default  the interest rate will be increased by a default rate margin of 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreement  including a breach of any of the covenants discussed above  wells fargo has the option to make any loans then outstanding under the credit agreement immediately due and payable and is no longer obligated to extend further credit to us under the credit agreement 

table of contents contractual obligations we have certain cash obligations and other commitments which will impact our short and long term liquidity 
at january   such obligations and commitments consisted of long term debt  operating leases and capital leases 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of january  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt includes principal and interest payments under our debt agreements assuming no additional borrowings or principal payments and includes purchase price payable of  related to our purchase of willdan energy solutions 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted sfas on the first day of fiscal year and the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements and disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to measure  at specified election dates  many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
a company that adopts sfas will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the provisions of sfas are elective  and through january   we had not elected to adopt sfas for any of our financial assets and liabilities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination
