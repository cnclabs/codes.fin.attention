item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses the results of our operations which are based upon the consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis also addresses our liquidity and financial condition and other matters 
general we are a diversified orthopedic products company offering a broad line of surgical and non surgical products for the spine  orthopedics  sports medicine and vascular market sectors 
our products are designed to address the lifelong bone and joint health needs of patients of all ages  helping them achieve a more active and mobile lifestyle 
we design  develop  manufacture  market and distribute medical equipment used principally by musculoskeletal medical specialists for orthopedic applications 
our main products are invasive and minimally invasive spinal implant products and related human cellular and tissue based products hct p products  non invasive bone growth stimulation products used to enhance the success rate of spinal fusions and to treat non union fractures  external and internal fixation devices used in fracture treatment  limb lengthening and bone reconstruction  and bracing products used for ligament injury prevention  pain management and protection of surgical repair to promote faster healing 
our products also include a device for enhancing venous circulation  cold therapy  other pain management products  bone cement and devices for removal of bone cement used to fix artificial implants and airway management products used in anesthesia applications 
we have administrative and training facilities in the united states and italy and manufacturing facilities in the united states  the united kingdom  italy and mexico 
we directly distribute our products in the united states  the united kingdom  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  france  belgium  mexico  brazil  and puerto rico 
in several of these and other markets  we also distribute our products through independent distributors 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and entities over which we have control 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
all balance sheet accounts  except shareholders equity  are translated at year end exchange rates  and revenue and expense items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are not significantly impacted by seasonality trends 
however  sales associated with products for elective procedures appear to be influenced by the somewhat lower level of such procedures performed in the late summer 
certain of the breg r bracing products experience greater demand in the fall and winter corresponding with high school and college football schedules and winter sports 
in addition  we do not believe our operations will be significantly affected by inflation 
however  in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  we seek to balance non dollar denominated income and expenditures 
during the year  we have used derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuation exposures 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on september   we completed the acquisition of blackstone medical  inc blackstone  a privately held company specializing in the design  development and marketing of spinal implant and related hct p products 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million  subject to certain closing adjustments  plus transaction costs totaling approximately million 
the acquisition and related costs were financed with million of senior secured bank debt and cash on hand 
financing costs were approximately million 

table of contents effective with the acquisition of blackstone  we manage our operations as four business segments domestic  blackstone  breg  and international 
domestic consists of operations of our subsidiary orthofix  inc blackstone consists of blackstone medical  inc  based in springfield  massachusetts and its two subsidiaries  blackstone gmbh and goldstone gmbh along with international distributors 
breg consists of breg s domestic operations and international distributors 
international consists of operations which are located in the rest of the world  excluding blackstone s international operations  and distributors along with breg s international distributors 
group activities are comprised of the operating expenses and identifiable assets of orthofix international nv and its nv holding company  orthofix holdings  inc critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  sales allowances and adjustments  inventories  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  derivatives and litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition for bone growth stimulation and certain bracing products that are prescribed by a physician  we recognize revenue when the product is placed on and accepted by the patient 
for domestic spinal implant and hct p products  we recognize revenue when the product has been utilized and we have received a confirming purchase order from the hospital 
for sales to commercial customers  including hospitals and distributors  revenues are recognized at the time of shipment unless contractual agreements specify that title passes only on delivery 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues in the united states from third party payors  including commercial insurance carriers  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and governmental payors such as medicare 
amounts paid by these third party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
these revenues are recorded at the expected or pre authorized reimbursement rates  net of any contractual allowances or adjustments 
some billings are subject to review by such third party payors and may be subject to adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances the process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts and the establishment of contractual allowances 
accounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
revisions in allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within sales and marketing expenses 
revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales 
in the judgment of management  adequate allowances have been provided for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
our estimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience 
inventory allowances we write down our inventory for inventory excess and obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory is analyzed to assess the adequacy of inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
reserves in excess and obsolescence provisions are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold 
if conditions or assumptions used in determining the market value change  additional inventory write down in the future may be necessary 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 require that goodwill  including the goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives  such as trademarks  cease to be amortized 
sfas no 
requires that we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment 
if we find that the carrying value of goodwill or a certain intangible asset exceeds its fair value  we will reduce the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset to the fair value  and we will recognize an impairment loss 
any such impairment losses will be recorded as non cash operating losses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets with definite lives should be tested for impairment if a triggering event  as defined in the standard  occurs 
upon a triggering event  we are to compare the cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the intangible asset and record an impairment charge based on the fair value of the intangible if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flow 
derivatives we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange within the consolidated financial statements according to our hedging policy 
under the policy  we may engage in non leveraged transactions involving various financial derivative instruments to manage exposed positions 
the policy requires us to formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction 
for instruments designated as a cash flow hedge  we formally assesses both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative that is used in the hedging transaction has been effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item and whether such derivative may be expected to remain effective in future periods 
if it is determined that a derivative is not or has ceased to be effective as a hedge  we will discontinue the related hedge accounting prospectively 
such a determination would be made when the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item  the derivative expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  or management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings 
for instruments designated as a fair value hedge  we ensure an exposed position is being hedged and the changes in fair value of such instruments are recognized in earnings 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  which requires that all derivatives be recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
for a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s change in fair value ie gains or losses is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income  net of related taxes  and subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings 
we utilize a cross currency swap to manage our foreign currency exposure related to a portion of our intercompany receivable of a us dollar functional currency subsidiary that is denominated in euro 
the cross currency swap has been accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 

table of contents litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  we are parties to or targets of lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  patent and intellectual property  health and safety and employment and healthcare regulatory matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
these lawsuits  investigations or proceedings could involve a substantial number of claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and customer base 
although we maintain various liability insurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits  investigations or proceedings  we are self insured for a significant portion of such liabilities 
we accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the process of analyzing  assessing and establishing reserve estimates for these types of claims involves judgment 
changes in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised 
we believe that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or our present insurance coverage 
as part of the total blackstone purchase price  approximately million was placed into an escrow account  against which we can make claims for reimbursement for certain defined items relating to the acquisition for which we are indemnified 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has certain contingencies arising from the acquisition that we expect will be reimbursable from the escrow account should we have to make a payment to a third party  including legal fees incurred related to the matter 
we believe that the amount that we will be required to pay relating to the contingencies will not exceed the amount of the escrow account  however  there can be no assurance that the contingencies will not exceed the amount of the escrow account 
tax matters we and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions 
the composite income tax rate  tax provisions  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise 
further  certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative  marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries 
these intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 
the tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria  transfer pricing provisions  or other aspects of their respective tax laws  which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  as such  we determine whether it is more likely than not that our tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of each position 
at december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared with million of unrecognized tax benefits at december  and accrued interest and penalties of million and million at december  and  respectively 
share based compensation as of january   we began recording compensation expense associated with stock options and other share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we have not restated results for prior periods 
under the modified prospective transition method  share based compensation expense for  and includes a compensation cost for all share based awards granted on or after january  as determined based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and b share based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
we recognize these compensation costs ratably over the vesting period  which is generally three years 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  our pre tax income for the years ended december  and has been reduced by share based compensation expense of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the fair value of each share based award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model for option pricing 
the model relies upon management assumptions for expected volatility rates based on the historical volatility using daily pricing of our common stock and the expected term of options granted  which is estimated based on a number of factors including the vesting term of the award  historical employee exercise behavior for both options that are currently outstanding and options that have been exercised or are expired  the expected volatility of our common stock and an employee s average length of service 
the risk free interest rate used in the model is determined based upon a constant us treasury security rate with a contractual life that approximates the expected term of the option award 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we reduce the calculated black scholes value by applying a forfeiture rate  based upon historical pre vesting option cancellations

the increase in sales was primarily the result of a increase in sales in the spine market sector which was attributable to increased demand for both our spinal stim r and cervical stim r products 
the increase in domestic s net sales was also attributable to an increase in our orthopedic market sector which included a increase in sales of physio stim r products as compared to the prior year period and an increase in sales of human cellular and tissue based products hct p products  often referred to as biologic products used in orthopedic applications for which there were no comparable sales in the prior year

during the integration of blackstone into our business we have experienced distributor terminations  government investigations and the replacement of one of our products with a successor product  all of which negatively impacted our sales during the year ended december  these decreases in sales have been partially offset by the increase in sales of our hct p products 
all of blackstone s sales are recorded in our spine market sector 
net sales in breg increased to million in compared to million in breg s net sales represented of our total net sales during both years ended december  and the increase in breg s net sales was primarily attributable to sales of breg bracing r products  which increased in  primarily as a result of increased sales of our fusion xt tm and other new products 
further  sales of our cold therapy products increased when compared to the prior year due to the recent launch of our new kodiak r cold therapy products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of our pain therapy products as a result of the sale of operations related to our pain care r line of ambulatory infusion pumps during march all of breg s sales are recorded in our sports medicine market sector 
net sales in international increased to million in compared to million in international net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
the impact of foreign currency increased international sales by or million when compared to the increase in international sales was attributable to the orthopedic market sector which increased primarily as a result of increased sales of our internal fixation products including the eight plate guided growth system r  which increased as well as an increase in sales of our external fixation products 
the sports medicine market sector increased compared to due to increased distribution of breg products

sales of distributed products  which include the laryngeal mask  decreased approximately 
international sales by market sector in us thousands growth spine orthopedics sports medicine vascular other international sales by market sector sales of our spine products grew to million in from million in the increase of million is primarily due to a increase in sales of spinal stimulation products in the united states 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of blackstone products as a result of distributor terminations  government investigations and the replacement of one of our products with a successor product  all of which negatively impacted our sales during the year ended december  spine product sales were of our total net sales in both years ended december  and  respectively 
sales of our orthopedics products increased to million in compared to million in the increase of million can be mainly attributed to a increase in sales of our internal fixation devices including the eight plate guided growth system r as well as a increase in sales of our external fixation devices 
also attributing to the increase in sales was a increase in sales of our physio stim r products as compared to the prior year period and an increase in sales of hct p products used in orthopedic applications for which there were no comparable sales in the prior year 
orthopedic product sales were and of our total net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents sales of our sports medicine products increased from million in to million in as discussed above  the increase of million is primarily due to sales of our breg r bracing products as well as our cold therapy products  offset by a decrease in our pain therapy products  which can be mainly attributed to the sale of operations relating to our pain care r line in march sports medicine product sales were of our total net sales for both years ended december  and sales of our vascular products  which consist of our a v impulse system r  decreased to million in  compared to million in vascular product sales were and of our total net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively

other product sales were and of our total net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to the increase in net sales from the prior year 
in the year ended december   due to reduced projections in revenue  distributor terminations  new products  and the replacement of one of our products with a successor product  the company changed its estimates regarding the inventory allowance at blackstone  primarily based on estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the change in estimate resulted in an increase in the reserve for inventory obsolescence of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million for amortization of the step up in inventory associated with the blackstone acquisition 
since the step up in the blackstone inventory from purchase accounting was fully amortized during  no such amortization was recorded during the year ended december  gross profit as a percent of sales in was compared to in gross profit  excluding the additional reserve recorded at blackstone was in the year ended december  the lower margin is principally the result of changes in product and geographic mix 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses  which include commissions  royalties and bad debt provisions generally increase and decrease in relation to sales 
sales and marketing expense increased million to million in from million in the increase is attributed to increased expense in order to support increased sales activity  including higher commissions on higher sales 
in addition sales and marketing expense included approximately million of costs incurred related to the completed exploration of the potential divestiture of our orthopedic fixation business 
sales and marketing as a percent of net sales for and were and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million in from million in the increase is due primarily to approximately million of costs incurred in connection with the company s potential divestiture of certain orthopedic fixation assets and other strategic transaction during the first and second quarters of the company also incurred approximately million of corporate reorganization expenses in the third and fourth quarters of general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were and in and  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million to million in compared to million in in  we incurred million in expenses related to the company s collaboration with mtf on the development and commercialization of trinity r evolution tm 
research and development expenses as a percent of net sales were in and in amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million in this decrease can be primarily attributed to the impairment of certain intangible assets at blackstone in the third quarter of 
table of contents impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets in  we incurred million of expense related to the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we performed an impairment analysis of indefinite lived intangibles 
we determined that the blackstone trademark  an indefinite lived intangible asset  was impaired by million 
due to the recent trend of decreasing revenues at blackstone  we evaluated the fair value of goodwill at blackstone 
the fair value of blackstone was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill related to blackstone exceeded its implied fair value  and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million 
in addition  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets we determined that a triggering event had occurred with respect to the definite lived intangible assets at blackstone 
we compared the expected cash flows to be generated by the blackstone reporting unit  which represented the lowest level at which separate cash flows are identifiable  on an undiscounted basis to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we determined the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flow and  as a result  impaired the distribution network and technologies at blackstone to their fair values which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
in  as part of our annual impairment test under sfas no 
 we determined that the blackstone trademark  an indefinite lived intangible asset  was impaired by million because the book value exceeded the fair value 
gain on sale of pain care r operations gain on sale of pain care r operations was million and represented the gain on the sale of operations related to our pain care r line of ambulatory infusion pumps during march no such gain was recorded in the same period of interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in interest expense in and included interest expense of million and million  respectively  related to the senior secured term loan used to finance the blackstone acquisition 
this decrease can be mainly attributed to less outstanding principal from the comparable period in the prior year 
unrealized non cash loss on interest rate swap in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred an unrealized non cash loss of approximately million which resulted from changes in the fair value of the company s interest rate swap 
due to declining interest rates and a libor floor in our amended credit facility  the effectiveness of the swap was no longer deemed highly effective  therefore changes in the fair value of the swap agreement are required to be reported in earnings through the expiration of the swap in june loss on refinancing of senior secured term loan in the third quarter of  we incurred million of expense related to the refinancing of the senior secured term loan used to finance the blackstone acquisition 
this included a million non cash write off of previously capitalized debt placement costs and million of fees associated with the amendment 
we anticipated that we would not remain in compliance with certain financial covenants included in the senior secured credit facility and  consequently  negotiated an amendment of our financial covenants  among other things  with our lenders effective september  there was no comparable charge in other  net other  net was expense of million in compared to income of million in the decrease can be mainly attributed to the effect of foreign exchange 
during  we recorded foreign exchange losses of million principally as a result of a rapid strengthening of the us dollar against various foreign currencies including the euro  pound  peso and brazilian real 
several of our foreign subsidiaries hold trade or intercompany payables or receivables in currencies most notably the us dollar denominated in other than their functional local currency which results in foreign exchange gains or losses when there is relative movement between those currencies 
income tax benefit expense our estimated worldwide effective tax rates were and during and  respectively

the effective tax rate for included a tax credit for research and development expense related to thru without the benefit for the research and development tax credits our estimated worldwide effective tax rate for would have been 
the increase in the effective tax rate  excluding discrete items  primarily relates to the suspension of the company s intercompany deferred consideration agreement in the first quarter of

the increase in sales was primarily the result of a increase in sales in the spine market sector which was attributable to increased demand for both our spinal stim r and cervical stim r products 
the orthopedics market sector also experienced a increase in compared to this increase is primarily due to a increase in sales of physio stim r due to an increase in demand and a increase in sales of internal fixation due to growth in sales of newer fixation products including the veronail r  contours vps r and the eight plate guided growth system r 
this increase was partially offset by an decrease in external fixation devices because external fixation devices are sharing the market for treatment of difficult fractures with internal fixation alternatives such as plating and nailing 
domestic sales by market sector in us thousands growth spine orthopedics domestic net sales in blackstone were million in compared to million in blackstone represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
blackstone was acquired on september  and therefore only sales after that date are included in our sales for all of blackstone s sales are recorded in our spine market sector 
on a pro forma basis blackstone sales increased when compared to primarily due to an increase in sales of hct p products and would have represented of pro forma total net sales in during the integration of blackstone into our business  we have experienced substantial turnover of sales management and distributors 
we have replaced approximately of the sales management personnel and a number of distributors 
our sales prospectively will be negatively impacted until these distributors are established in selling blackstone products 
net sales in breg increased to million in compared to million in this increase in sales was primarily attributable to sales of breg bracing r products  which increased in due to increased demand for our fusion r knee brace and to breg cold therapy products  which increased in due to increased demand for our newly introduced kodiak product line 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales for pain therapy products due to reduced utilization by providers 
all of breg s sales are recorded in our sports medicine market sector 

table of contents net sales in international increased to million in compared to million in international net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
the increase in international sales was attributable to the orthopedics market sector which increased due to increased sales of internal fixation devices  including the iskd r and eight plate guided growth system r and increased sales of other orthopedic products 
these increases were slightly offset by decreases in sales of external fixation devices which are due to internal fixation alternative devices sharing the market as discussed above

gross profit as a percent of net sales in was compared to in during  we experienced negative impacts from the amortization of the step up in inventory of million associated with the blackstone acquisition 
operational pressures on blackstone gross profit margins resulting from the impacts of product and channel mix changes were offset by higher sales of higher margin stimulation products 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses  which include commissions  royalties and bad debt provisions  increased million to million in from million in the increase is mainly due the inclusion of blackstone for the full year approximately million as well as higher commissions  royalties and other variable costs associated with higher sales  an increase in sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
primary exposures include changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
these exposures can vary sales  cost of sales  and costs of operations  the cost of financing and yields on cash and short term investments 
we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
however  our risk management policy does not allow us to hedge positions we do not hold and we do not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had a currency swap transaction in place to minimize future foreign currency exchange risk related to a million euro intercompany note foreign currency exposure 
see item under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to other income expense  net 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our senior secured term loan and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at floating rates based on libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
therefore  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant

as of december   we had million of variable rate term debt represented by borrowings under our senior secured term loan at a floating interest rate of libor  with a libor floor of plus a margin or the prime rate plus a margin

our overall effective interest rate  including the impact of the swap  as of december  on our senior secured debt was 
based on the balance outstanding under the senior secured term loan combined with the swap as of december   an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate on the variable rate debt would cause an increase in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 

table of contents our foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro  great britain pound  mexican peso and brazilian real 
we are subject to cost of goods currency exposure when we produce products in foreign currencies such as the euro or great britain pound and sell those products in us dollars 
we are subject to transactional currency exposures when foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency 
as of december   we had an unhedged intercompany receivable denominated in euro for approximately million 
we recorded a foreign currency loss in of million which resulted from the weakening of the euro against the us dollar during the period 
we also are subject to currency exposure from translating the results of our global operations into the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
the us dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies was favorably impacted in and by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the u 
s dollar against the local foreign currency during these periods 
as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results
