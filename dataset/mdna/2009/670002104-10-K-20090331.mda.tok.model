overview novavax  inc  a delaware corporation novavax or the company  was incorporated in  and is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating differentiated  value added vaccines that improve upon current preventive options for a range of infectious diseases 
these vaccines leverage the company s virus like particle vlp platform technology coupled with a unique  disposable production technology 
the company produces these vlp based  potent  recombinant vaccines utilizing new and efficient manufacturing approaches 
vlps are genetically engineered three dimensional nanostructures  which incorporate immunologically important lipids and recombinant proteins 
our vlps resemble the virus but lack the genetic material to replicate the virus 
our proprietary production technology uses insect cells rather then chicken eggs or mammalian cells 
the company s current product targets include vaccines against the hn and other subtypes of avian influenza with pandemic potential  human seasonal influenza  varicella zoster  which causes shingles  and a respiratory syncytial virus rsv 
rsv vaccine was recently announced on october  we made significant progress in and in our vaccine that targets the hn avian influenza with pandemic potential 
in december  we announced favorable interim results for a phase i clinical trial which began in july for our pandemic influenza vaccine  that demonstrated immunogenicity and safety 
in august  we received favorable results from a phase i iia trial which was conducted to gather additional patient immunogenicity and safety data  as well as to determine a final dose  which demonstrated strong neutralizing antibody titers across all three doses tested 
although the safety data are still blinded pending complete safety follow up  there were no serious adverse events reported 
in february  we announced that the vaccine induced robust hemagglutination inhibition hai responses  which have been shown to be important for protection against influenza disease 
we only intend to initiate further human clinical trials for our pandemic influenza vaccine  which would be required for regulatory approval  with a collaborative partner 
we also progressed development of our vlp trivalent vaccine that targets seasonal influenza virus in and in december  we announced favorable safety and immunogenicity results from our phase iia seasonal study in healthy adults which we commenced in september to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of different doses of our seasonal influenza vaccine 
we observed a slightly different safety profile non serious adverse events from our phase iia trial of our pandemic vlp vaccine  and plan to review and analyze the dose response curve as well as the safety data from the healthy adult seasonal trial before commencing a seasonal influenza dose ranging study in the elderly years of age next year 
further seasonal studies are planned in we intend to seek a collaborative partner for our seasonal influenza vaccine upon completion of additional phase ii clinical studies  which are expected to be completed by the end of we have also developed vaccine candidates for both rsv and vzv  both of which are currently being evaluated in preclinical studies 
to date  preliminary data have shown that an rsv vaccine candidate has shown positive results in two separate studies with mice 
in december  novavax and the university of massachusetts jointly announced favorable results from a preclinical study to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of an rsv vaccine candidate in mice 
the rsv vlp vaccine induced strong antibody responses against rsv 
in february  we announced favorable results from an rsv preclinical study performed in mice against the viral fusion f protein  which fuses with cells in the respiratory tract and causes illness 
a vzv vaccine candidate has also induced antibody and t cell responses 
we plan on moving forward with further preclinical development of both vaccines in our vaccine products currently under development or in clinical trials will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive pre clinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval  prior to commercial use 
there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will be successful or that any potential products will prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials 
even if developed  these vaccine products may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully introduced and marketed at prices that would permit us to operate profitably 
the commercial launch of any vaccine product is subject to certain risks including but not limited to  manufacturing scale up and market acceptance 
no assurance can be given that we can generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable or generate positive cash flow from operations at all or on a sustained basis 
we also have a drug delivery platform based on our micellar nanoparticle mnp technology  proprietary oil and water nano emulsions used for the topical delivery of drug 
the mnp technology was the basis for the development of our first fda approval estrogen replacement product known as estrasorb 
in february  we sold our assets related to estrasorb in the united states  canada and mexico to graceway pharmaceuticals  llc graceway and terminated the estrasorb license agreement with allergan 
we engaged an investment bank to aid in the search for potential buyers or licensees in fields of use outside vaccines  but were not successful 
accordingly  we fully impaired these assets by recording a charge in the amount of  summary of significant transactions on march   company and cadila pharmaceuticals ltd  a company incorporated under the laws of india cadila entered into a joint venture agreement the jva pursuant to which the company and cadila formed cpl biologicals limited  a joint venture the jv  of which will be owned by cadila and is owned by the company 
the jv must obtain approval from india s foreign investment promotion board the fipb prior to issuing shares to novavax 
the jv will develop and commercialize the company s seasonal influenza virus like particle vlp based vaccine candidate and cadila s therapeutic vaccine candidates against cancer as well as its adjuvants  biogeneric products and other diagnostic products for the territory of india 
novavax will also contribute to the jv technology for the development of several other vlp vaccine candidates against diseases of public health concern in the territory  such as hepatitis e and chikungunya fever 
cadila will contribute approximately million over three years to support the jv s operations 
the jv will be responsible for clinical testing and registration of products that will be marketed and sold in india 
the board of directors of the jv consists of five members  three of whom including the chairman of the board are nominated by cadila and two of whom are nominated by novavax 
if the board is not in unanimous agreement on an issue  the ceos of the company and cadila will work to resolve the issue 
if the ceos cannot resolve the issue in five business days  a vote by the majority of the board will decide 
however  the approval of the company and cadila  as shareholders of the jv  and the board of directors of the jv is required for the sale of all or most of the assets of the jv  a change in control of the jv  the liquidation  dissolution  or winding up of the jv  any occurrence of indebtedness that results in the jv having a debt to equity ratio of to or greater  or most amendments of the jva or the jv s articles of association 
the jv has the right to negotiate a definitive agreement for rights to for certain future novavax products other than rsv and certain future cadila products in india prior to novavax or cadila licensing such rights to a third party 
novavax has the right to negotiate the licensing of vaccines developed by the joint venture using novavax s technology for commercialization in every country except for india and vaccines developed by the joint venture using cadila s technology for commercialization in certain other countries  including the united states 
in connection with the jva  on march   the company also entered into license agreement  an option to enter into a license agreement  a technical services agreement and a supply agreement with the jv 
also on march   novavax entered into a binding  non cancellable stock purchase agreement the spa with satellite overseas holdings limited sohl  a subsidiary of cadila  pursuant to which sohl has agreed to purchase million shares of company common stock  par value the common stock at the market price of per share 
novavax expects to deliver the shares of common stock on april  the company expects to raise gross proceeds of million in the offering 
the net proceeds to the company from the sale of the common stock  after deducting estimated offering expenses payable by the company  is approximately million 
the spa provides that  as long as sohl owns more than of the company s then outstanding common stock  sohl may purchase a pro rata portion of any company common stock sale or issuance 
under the spa  certain issuances are exempt from sohl s pre emptive right  including shares issued as stock dividends  stock splits  or otherwise payable pro rata to all holders of common stock  to employees  officers  directors or consultants of the company pursuant to an employee benefit program  upon the conversion or exercise of any options  warrants or other rights to purchase common stock  and as consideration for a merger  consolidation  purchase of assets  or in connection with a joint venture or strategic partnership

facility exit costs in july  we decided to consolidate our research and development and manufacturing activities into our facility at belward campus drive in rockville  maryland by closing our taft court facility in rockville  maryland 
the taft court location was used to support the manufacturing requirements for early stage clinical trial materials for our vlp vaccine candidates 
our new gmp pilot manufacturing facility located at our belward campus drive location will be used to support clinical trials and may also be used for future commercialization quantities of our vlp vaccines 
the move commenced in september and was completed on october  for the year ended december   we included  in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations  which represents the fair value of the remaining lease payments 
this amount has not been reduced by any estimated sublease rentals as we do not anticipate receiving and do not have any current proposals to sub let this space 
our accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  include  related to the remaining lease payments 
for the year ended december   research and development costs on our consolidated statement of operations include  associated with the impairment of these leasehold improvements

the purchasers in the offering were comprised of current and new institutional shareholders and affiliates of the company 
the securities described above were offered by the company pursuant to a registration statement previously filed and declared effective by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
we estimated the fair value attributable to the warrants of approximately million as of the date of grant by applying the black scholes pricing valuation model 
the black scholes pricing model utilized the following assumptions a risk free interest rate of  expected volatility of  and expected term of years and a warrant issue date stock price of

the additional monthly rent is subject to the annual escalation included in the original lease 
on june   we received million from the landlord as reimbursement for leasehold improvements 
the amount was recorded as deferred rent on the balance sheet and is being amortized as a credit to rent expense over the remaining lease term 
graceway agreements in february  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with graceway pharmaceuticals  llc graceway  pursuant to which novavax sold graceway its assets related to estrasorb in the united states  canada and mexico 
the assets sold include certain patents related to the mnp technology  trademarks  know how  manufacturing equipment  customer and supplier relations  goodwill and other assets

convertible notes on june   we entered into amendment agreements the amendments with each of the holders of the outstanding senior convertible notes the notes to amend the terms of the notes 
as of december   million aggregate principal amount remained outstanding under the notes 
the amendments i lowered the conversion price from to per share  ii eliminated the holders right to require the company to redeem the notes if the weighted average price of the company s common stock is less than the conversion price on of the consecutive trading days preceding july  or july  and iii mandated that the notes be converted into company common stock if the weighted average price of the company s common stock is greater than a decrease from in any out of consecutive trading days after july  the number of shares to be issued as repayment is determined by dividing the amount of the maturity date payment to be paid in shares by the redemption conversion price 
the redemption conversion price is of the arithmetic average of the weighted average price of the common stock on each trading day during the measurement period 
the weighted average price is the dollar volume weighted price on nasdaq as reported by bloomberg 
the measurement period is the consecutive trading days ending on and including the second trading day preceding the maturity date 
we determined the change in the value of the conversion option and have reduced the convertible debt amount by  related to this amendment  which beginning on june   is being accreted over the remaining term through july  of the convertible notes as interest expense 
the notes mature on july  under the terms of the notes  novavax  at its option  can pay up to of the outstanding notes in novavax common stock on the due date of july   subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including  among other things  a requirement that the shares issued upon conversion be registered or freely tradable without registration  that novavax s shares of common stock have not been suspended from trading on nasdaq during the applicable measurement period  there is no threatened delisting or suspension  and that the company is otherwise in compliance with its agreements with the note holders 
the amount of shares that may be issued at maturity may be subject to adjustment depending on the note holder s percentage ownership of the company on an as converted basis and if our stock price falls below during the measurement period 
as a result  we will have to pay at least million in cash to satisfy the notes on the due date unless the notes are converted into common stock  redeemed or amended 
notes with former directors in march  pursuant to the novavax  inc stock option plan  we approved the payment of the exercise price of options by two of our directors through the delivery of full recourse  interest bearing promissory notes in the aggregate amount of  the notes were secured by an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
in may  one of these directors resigned from the company s board of directors 
following his resignation  we approved an extension of the former director s  note to be payable on december   or earlier to the extent of the net proceeds from any sale of the pledged shares 
we entered into negotiations with the former director to extend the loan in january as of december   the interest accrued on this note totaled  and was fully reserved since management believes the collectability of this amount is uncertain 
on may  the company and the former director entered into an amended and restated promissory note and an amended and restated pledge agreement the amendment 
the amendment restates the entire amount outstanding as of december   including accrued interest  or  as the new outstanding principal amount 
furthermore  the amendment extends the maturity date of the note to june   permits the company to sell the pledged shares if the market price of the common stock as reported on nasdaq global market exceeds certain targets  increases the interest rate to and stipulates quarterly payments beginning june  we received the first payment of  in july and a second payment of  in october in january  we received an additional payment of  in march  the other director resigned 
following his resignation  we approved an extension of the former director s  note 
the note continues to accrue interest at per annum and is secured by shares of common stock owned by the former director and is payable on june   or earlier to the extent of the net proceeds from any sale of the pledged shares 
in addition  we have the option to sell the pledged shares on behalf of the former director at any time that the market price of our common stock  as reported on nasdaq global market  exceeds per share 
as of december   the interest accrued on this note totaled  and was fully reserved since management believes collectability of this amount is uncertain 
we continue to actively work with these two individuals to collect the amounts outstanding and reserve our rights to pursue the remedies available to us 
due to heightened sensitivity in the current environment surrounding related party transactions and the extensions of the maturity dates  these transactions could be viewed negatively in the market and our stock price could be negatively affected 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for stock based compensation  goodwill  valuation of net deferred tax assets  and the valuation of our investments  have a material impact on our financial statements and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations discussed below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition and allowances the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

for product sales  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company establishes allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  rebates and charge backs based on historical trends and specifically identified problem accounts 
for upfront payments and licensing fees related to contract research or technology  the company follows the provisions of sab no 
in determining if these payments and fees represent the culmination of a separate earnings process or if they should be deferred and recognized as revenue as earned over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of contract specified events and when there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenue earned under research contracts is recognized in accordance with the terms and conditions of such contracts for reimbursement of costs incurred and defined milestones 
stock based compensation we account for our stock options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options 
under the provisions of sfas r  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
in we estimated this amount based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting terminations 
our estimate of the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury debt securities with maturities close to the expected term of the option as of the date of grant 
as required under sfas r  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
also  the accounting estimate of stock based compensation expense is reasonably likely to change from period to period as further stock options are granted and adjustments are made for stock option forfeitures and cancellations 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
such costs include internal research and development expenditures such as salaries and benefits  raw materials and supplies and contracted services such as sponsored research  consulting and testing services of proprietary research and development activities and similar expenses associated with collaborative research agreements 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb staff position no 
fin 
under sfas and fin  we must recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities  and deferred tax assets and liabilities  are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not would be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax positions requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  and the applicable statute of limitations 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill originally results from business acquisitions 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
other intangible assets are a result of product acquisitions  non compete arrangements and internally discovered patents 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment tests annually  or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
we utilize both the market approach and the income approach to determine if we have an impairment of our goodwill 
the income approach was used as a confirming look to the market approach 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 we initially tested our goodwill for impairment as of january  and determined that no impairment was present 
we thereafter performed the required annual impairment test as of december of each year on the carrying amount of its goodwill 
our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at december of each year 
given the current economic conditions and the uncertainties regarding their impact on our company  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future  or that any change in the assumptions or the current economic conditions will not trigger another goodwill impairment test before december  if our assumptions are not achieved or economic conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
these impairment charges may be a partial or full impairment of the current balance 
disposal of long lived assets discontinued operations we account for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal sfas no 

sfas no 
requires a periodic evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the recoverability of the carrying value of an asset should be assessed include  but are not limited to  the following a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant physical change in an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses  and or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue 
we consider historical performance and anticipated future results in its evaluation of potential impairment 
accordingly  when indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the business and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets 
impairment losses are recognized when the sum of expected future cash flows is less than the assets carrying value 
sfas no 
also provides accounting and reporting provisions for components of an entity that are classified as discontinued operations 
we recorded an impairment loss in connection with the discontinued operations of our philadelphia  pennsylvania manufacturing facility for the year ended december  see notes to consolidated financial statements note discontinued operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
 which provides companies an option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the intent of sfas no 
is to reduce the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning january  the company did not elect the fair value option under sfas no 
for any of its financial instruments upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

sfas no 
r retains the fundamental requirements of sfas no 
that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
in addition  the scope of sfas no 
r is broader than sfas no 
because it applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
sfas no 
r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december  and early adoption is not allowed 
we are currently evaluating the effects that sfas no 
r may have on any future business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued eitf issue no

contract research revenues were million for as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in contract research revenues was primarily due to the completion of a third government contract during the first quarter of we did not record any product sales in and due to the discontinuation of the sale of gynodiol in we recorded the excess of returns on our product sales as costs of goods sold

in june  we decided to discontinue the sale of gynodiol 
cost of products sold decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease was entirely due to lower gross sales of gynodiol due to the discontinued sale of the product during the third quarter of  as discussed above 
research and development expenses research and development costs increased from million for year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to higher research and development spending to support our strategic focus on creating differentiated  value added vaccines that leverage our proprietary vlp technology 
outside testing costs including outsourced clinical trial costs  sponsored research and consulting agreements associated with expanded preclinical testing  human clinical trials  process development  manufacturing and quality related programs necessary to move our influenza vaccine candidates into human clinical trials and license fees paid to wyeth account for million of the increase 
the remaining increase of million can be attributed to an increase in employee related costs of million  an increase in facility costs of million and million accrued in related to future lease payments for our taft court facility in rockville  maryland 
research and development costs in also include million related to the revision of the useful life of the leasehold improvements at the taft court facility 
the costs associated with our taft court facility resulted from our decision to consolidate our research and development and manufacturing activities into our belward campus drive facility in rockville  maryland 
research and development costs increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
research and development expenses were significantly higher in due to a million increase in outside testing costs including sponsored research and consulting agreements associated with expanded preclinical testing and process development  manufacturing and quality related programs  license fees paid to wyeth holdings corporation and the initiation of human clinical trials necessary to advance our influenza vaccine candidates in clinical development 
the remaining increase of million can be attributed to a million increase in employee related costs and a million increase in lab supplies 
general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the correction of the classification of the notes receivable due from former directors to show these notes as reductions of equity in the december  consolidated balance sheet 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses include a million credit to the allowance established for the notes receivable 
during the year ended december   we concluded that the notes receivable from the former directors should be classified as a reduction of equity and had been erroneously reclassified to an asset during the prior fiscal years 
therefore  the reserve charges taken to the statement of operations during and and during the first two quarters of  totaling million were also determined to be incorrect 
we are of the opinion that when evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively  the impact of the prior period error is not material to the financial statements during any period presented 
as such  we have determined it is appropriate to record the correction of this matter in the third quarter results and to not make modifications to any prior filings 
the credit to general and administrative expenses is a result of the adjustment recorded in the current year results to correct the cumulative impact of the prior period errors noted above 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were also impacted by lower facility costs of approximately million for the new facility in rockville  maryland and decreased employee costs of approximately million as we implemented our plan to consolidate all operations into our belward campus drive facility in rockville  maryland 
the credit to general and administrative expenses discussed above and the decreases in facility and employee costs was partially offset by the impairment charge to the mnp assets of expenses for the year ended december  also included non recurring costs for the adoption of fin of million  consulting fees related to studies of the vaccine market of million  and investment banker fees of million related to our decision to divest our mnp technology

additionally  our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances decreased primarily due to increased spending levels related to our vaccine development programs 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in interest expense is due to the increase in the amortization of debt discount of million  related to the amendment of the convertible notes  which occurred in june the debt discount of  is being amortized over the remaining term of the convertible notes  through july additionally  we recorded million as an impairment loss on investments for the year ended december   related to an other than temporary impairment loss on our auction rate securities 
net interest and other income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
interest income remained constant at million in both and  despite lower cash and cash equivalent balances in  due to offsetting higher interest rates earned on investments in as compared to interest expense decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of million  or

these excess costs over the product cost totaled million and million for the years ended december  and research and development costs from discontinued operations were million for the year ended december  there were no research and developments costs from discontinued operations for the year ended december  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase resulted from a decrease in revenue and an increase in operating expenses 
revenue from discontinued operations decreased to million for from million for  a decrease of million

weighted shares outstanding increased in to million shares from million in the increase in weighted shares in was principally due to vesting of restricted stock and exercising of stock options 
liquidity matters and capital resources our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors including but not limited to  the maturity of our notes on july   the commitments and progress of our research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and manufacturing costs 
we plan to continue to have multiple vaccines and products in various stages of development and we believe our research and development as well as general and administrative expenses and capital requirements will continue to increase 
we will need to engage in capital raising activities in the near term 
future activities  particularly vaccine and product development  are subject to our ability to raise funds through public or private financings using equity and or debt securities  or collaborative licensing and development arrangements with industry partners and government agencies 
year ended december  continuing discontinued summary of cash flows operations operations total in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year during the three year period ended december   we have funded our operations primarily from the following activities net proceeds in millions total sales of common stock in equity offerings  net license payments received exercise of stock options and warrants lease incentives received in additional to the net proceeds outlined above  as part of the graceway transaction  we sold our rights related to estrasorb in the united states  canada and mexico to graceway as well as certain manufacturing equipment for the production of estrasorb 
we also manufactured additional quantities of estrasorb with final delivery completed in july the net cash impact from this transaction was in excess of million for the year ended december  as of december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million at december  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  are net of a million realized loss related to the impairment of our auction rate securities recorded for the year ended december  the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during was primarily due to the operating losses from continuing operations of million  principal payments on debt of million  capital expenditures for our belward campus drive good manufacturing practices gmp facility project  partially offset by the proceeds of our equity financing completed on july  of million  and the proceeds from the graceway transaction 
we also received a lease incentive totaling million from our landlord related to the extension of our lease term at our corporate headquarters 
as of december   our working capital was million compared to million as of december  this million decrease primarily resulted from our net loss and the reclassification of our convertible debt to current liabilities  partially offset by the proceeds of our equity financing completed on july   an upfront payment received from graceway as part of the estrasorb transaction in february and a million lease incentive received from our landlord in june additionally  we purchased million of capital expenditures activities and made million in principal payments on our outstanding debt obligations during the year ended december  as of december   we held million in cash and investments as compared to million at december  the million decrease in cash and investments during  was due to the operating loss from continued operations of million  cash used from discontinued operations of million  and principal payments on debt of million  partially offset by non cash expenses of million and net balance sheet changes of million 
in addition  capital expenses totaled million in  primarily for equipment for vaccine development and the initial investment in the build out of a new gmp facility in our corporate headquarters 
at december  we had cash totaling million and auction rate securities with a face value of million and a fair value of million 
there has been insufficient demand at auction for each of our five auction rate securities  which had a par value totaling million 
we recorded an impairment charge on these investments of million in the fourth quarter of on these investments due primarily to their illiquidity  and believe the million it has recorded at december  represents their fair market value and the value we could liquidate the investment for  if necessary 
we are currently evaluating what purchase price it could get for these securities now and what the risks along with the benefits of holding verses selling these securities 
without liquidity of these auction rate securities  our cash position would be negatively affected 
we will seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity and or debt financing 
we intend to use the proceeds from these financing transactions to pay all or a portion of the principal and interest due on the notes and for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to our internal research and development programs  such as preclinical and clinical testing and studies for our vaccine and other product candidates  the development of new technologies  capital improvements and general working capital 
we will also seek to fund our operations through licensing and development arrangements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or  if such capital is available  that the terms of any financing will be satisfactory to the company 
any capital raised by an equity offering will likely be substantially dilutive to the stockholders and any licensing or development arrangement may require the company to give up rights to a product or technology at less than its full potential value 
as of march   we have sold  shares of common stock and received net proceeds in the amount of pursuant to the sales agreement with wm smith 
on march   we entered into a binding  non cancellable stock purchase agreement to sell million shares to a wholly owned subsidiary of cadila for a market price of per share 
we expect to close this transaction on april  and expect to receive net proceeds in the amount of million 
based on the amount of funds on hand  the anticipated proceeds from the cadila transaction  our intention to pay of the outstanding notes in novavax common stock  and our planned business operations  we believe we will have adequate capital resources to operate at planned levels for at least the next twelve months 
however  we are planning to raise additional capital during in order to continue its current level of operations and to pursue the business plan beyond we have not  however  secured any additional commitments for new financing at this time nor can we provide any assurance that new financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
any equity financing would cause significant dilution at current market prices 
if the we are unable to immediately secure additional capital  we will continue to assess our capital resources and we may be required to downsize our operations  reduce general and administrative costs or to delay or reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product research and development programs  thereby causing delays in our efforts to introduce our future products to market 
should we be unable to accomplish these activities  we may not be able to continue its business 
as of december   we had million of senior convertible notes outstanding the notes 
the notes carry a coupon  are currently convertible into shares of novavax common stock at per share  and mature on july  under the terms of the notes  we can  at our option  pay up to of the outstanding notes in our common stock on the due date of july   subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including  among other things  a requirement that the shares issued upon conversion be registered or freely tradable without registration  that novavax s shares of common stock have not been suspended from trading on the nasdaq global market during the applicable measurement period and there is no threatened delisting or suspension  and that we are otherwise in compliance with its agreements with the note holders 
the amount of shares that may be issued at maturity may be subject to adjustment depending on the note holder s percentage ownership of the company on an as converted basis and if our stock price falls below during the measurement period 
as a result  we will have to pay a least million in cash to satisfy the notes on the due date unless the notes are converted into common stock  redeemed or amended 
contractual obligations and commitments we utilize different financing instruments  such as debt and operating leases  to finance various equipment and facility needs 
the following table summarizes our current financing obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands less than more than commitments obligations total year years years years convertible notes operating leases notes payable total principal payments less subleases net principal payments interest total commitments obligations convertible notes are reflected at their par value 
on june   we amended the lease for our corporate headquarters at belward campus drive in rockville  maryland 
the amendment extended the term of the lease to january   provided that the landlord reimburse novavax for up to million in leasehold improvements and increases the monthly installments of base rent going forward  by an additional  per month 
the additional monthly rent is subject to the annual escalation included in the original lease 
on june   we received million from the landlord as reimbursement for leasehold improvements 
the amount was recorded in deferred rent on the balance sheet  and is being amortized as a credit to rent expense over the remaining lease term 
in march  we further amended the sublease with puricore 
the amendment  which is effective as of november   extends the term of the sublease until september   expands the sublease premises to include all of the approximately  rentable square feet and grants puricore the option to renew the lease for an additional three year term 
in addition to the amounts reflected in the table above in the future  we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our collaborators or license holders based on the achievement product sales  milestones and other specific objectives 
based on our available capital and cash burn rate  if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product research and development programs  downsize our organization  or reduce general and administrative infrastructure

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as follows cash and cash equivalents million short term investments classified as available for sale million our exposure to market risk is confined to our investment portfolio 
as of december   our short term investments are classified as available for sale 
we do not believe that a change in the market rates of interest would have any significant impact on the realizable value of our investment portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  could impact our cash flows and results of operations 
short term investments at december  consist of investments in five auction rate securities with a par value of million and a fair value of million 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge to operating related to these securities during the fourth quarter of of million because of the current turmoil in the credit markets and management s belief these securities cannot presently be sold at par value but are saleable at a discount from their par value 
the collateral for these aaa rated securities is guaranteed by agencies of the united states against loss of principal and interest by bond insurers 
we have classified these securities as short term investments and have accounted for our investments in these securities as available for sale securities under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

although the auction rate securities have variable interest rates which typically reset every to days through a competitive bidding process known as a dutch auction  they have long term contractual maturities 
these investments are classified within current assets because we may need to liquidate these securities within the next year 
the available for sale securities are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses on these securities  if determined to be temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we assess the recoverability of our available for sale securities and  if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value 
other than temporary impairments are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
as noted above  during the year ended december   there was a million impairment recorded against the available for sale securities 
the impairment was concluded to be other than temporary  thus the charge was taken in the consolidated statement of operations 
we had invested in auction rate securities for short periods of time as part of our cash management program 
recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us from liquidating certain holdings of auction rate securities subsequent to december  as the amount of securities submitted for sale during the auction has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
although an event of an auction failure does not necessarily mean that a security is impaired  we considered various factors to assess the fair value and the classification of the securities as short term assets 
fair value was determined through an independent valuation using two valuation methods a discounted cash flow method and a market comparables method 
certain factors used in these methods include  but are not necessarily limited to  comparable securities traded on secondary markets  timing of the failed auction  specific security auction history  quality of underlying collateral  rating of the security and the bond insurer  our ability and intent to retain the securities for a period of time to allow for anticipated recovery in the market value  and other factors 
interest and dividend income is recorded when earned and included in interest income 
premiums and discounts  if any  on short term investments are amortized or accreted to maturity and included in interest income 
the specific identification method is used in computing realized gains and losses on sale of our securities 
we are headquartered in the united states where we conduct the vast majority of our business activities 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
on june   we entered into amendment agreements the amendments with each of the holders of the outstanding notes to amend the terms of the notes 
as of december   million aggregate principal amount remained outstanding under the notes 
the amendments i lowered the conversion price from to per share  ii eliminated the holders right to require the company to redeem the notes if the weighted average price of the company s common stock is less than the conversion price on of the consecutive trading days preceding july  or july  and iii mandated that the notes be converted into company common stock if the weighted average price of the company s common stock is greater than a decrease from in any out of consecutive trading days after july  in connection with the amendments  we recorded a debt discount of  and increased additional paid in capital accordingly 
the debt discount is being amortized over the remaining term of the notes 
interest expense included  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the amortization of the debt discount 
at december   we had a total debt of million  most of which bears interest at fixed interest rates 
we do not believe that it is exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of our borrowing activities
