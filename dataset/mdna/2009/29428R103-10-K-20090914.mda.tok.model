the financial environment globally and in the united states was volatile during fiscal and challenging market conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year 
the sharp decline in equity markets across the globe and continuing dislocations in the credit markets adversely affected the entire financial sector during fiscal the equity and credit markets suffered from sub prime lending issues and major write downs related to the credit crisis  and failures of major financial institutions  which led to a pullback in consumer spending  increased unemployment  and significant declines in the values of assets owned by financial institutions 
investors confidence continued to weaken  which caused a shift in the markets from equity and corporate bonds to us treasury notes and bonds 
us and global equity market indices declined sharply during the fiscal year 
throughout our first fiscal quarter ended september   both us and world economic conditions were unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth 
credit markets continued to experience illiquidity and wider credit spreads 
continued concerns about the impact of residential and commercial mortgage loan products and structured investment vehicles caused the broader equity and credit markets to deteriorate 
in the us  equity markets decreased during the quarter by 
on a broad basis  developed global markets decreased by approximately 
the federal reserve provided additional liquidity and stability to the financial markets and tried to mitigate the negative economic impact related to the credit markets 
subsequent to the end of our first fiscal quarter  credit conditions worsened considerably and the us financial services industry changed dramatically 
us and foreign central banks  in response to a further weakening in the economy  took several steps 
the us federal government assumed a conservatorship role in two government sponsored entities gse s  federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association 
lehman brothers holdings inc declared bankruptcy  and the us federal government provided a loan to american international group inc aig in exchange for an equity interest in aig 
the federal reserve announced enhancements to its programs to provide additional liquidity to the asset backed commercial paper and money markets  and indicated that it planed to purchase from primary dealers short term debt obligations issued by gses 
the us treasury proposed a plan to buy mortgage related  illiquid and other troubled assets from us financial institutions and  in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of was enacted 
overall economic activity continued to weaken throughout the us and the world during our second fiscal quarter ended december  retail sales were weak  particularly throughout the holiday season 

table of contents lending activity continued to decline  as credit conditions tightened further 
the unemployment rate continued to rise 
there were several bank failures 
the federal reserve and foreign central banks and governments around the world continued to provide additional liquidity and stability to the financial markets to try to mitigate the negative economic impact related to the credit markets 
the federal reserve  while working in unison with several foreign central banks  lowered both the benchmark interest and discount rates to nearly during december 
during the quarter  stocks around the globe endured a period of remarkable volatility and posted one of their biggest down quarters on record 
in all  us and global markets declined by approximately during the quarter ended december  throughout our third fiscal quarter ended march   overall economic activity continued to remain weak  both domestically and internationally 
us gross domestic product gdp shrank at a annual pace  having already fallen at a rate in the previous quarter  and marked the worst two quarter performance for gdp in nearly a half century 
retail sales and lending activity remained weak 
housing continued to plummet and business investment plunged as firms slashed plans to expand in the backdrop of a deepening recession 
the unemployment rate climbed higher 
the us federal government put in place the largest economic stimulus plan in us history 
this plan supplemented the interest rate and other actions taken by the federal reserve and the us treasury over the previous several months 
during the quarter  stocks around the world continued to endure a period of remarkable volatility and continued to record large declines 
despite favorable market performance in the latter part of march  us and global markets declined by approximately during the quarter ended march  in a continuation of the equity market rebound that began in march  us stocks posted strong gains during the quarter ended june  and put an end to the longest streak of quarterly losses since equities rallied sharply in april and may from their march lows amid signs that the economy was in the process of bottoming and that government measures to stabilize the financial markets were starting to bear fruit 
investor sentiment was buoyed by scattered signs that the downward economic spiral was slowing during the quarter 
particularly encouraging to some were signs of an end to the severe contraction in the housing sector  as the government reported increases in housing starts and home sales 
the rate of job losses also appeared to slow and gauges of consumer sentiment showed substantial gains 
however  the rally dissipated and share prices fell in the final weeks of the quarter as this early optimism receded in the face of tepid economic news 
negative economic data mitigated the positive as the quarter progressed  and the case for a sustainable recovery lost steam 
weaker than expected economic data  particularly related to unemployment numbers and consumer spending continued to concern investors 
the weakness at the end of june was not enough to erase earlier strength  however  and all global equity markets ended the quarter in positive territory  led by an extraordinary rally in financial shares 
overall  us markets increased by approximately and global markets by approximately during the quarter ended june  despite this  however  the broad us and global market indexes remained about to below their highs  clear evidence of the enduring impact of the economic crisis 
company impact and outlook while the past fiscal year was extremely challenging for our industry  marked by unprecedented financial volatility and economic and market weakness  the company continued to grow and prosper 
additional distribution channels were developed  our client base expanded  new investment products continued to be introduced  corporate liquid assets as well as liquidity ratios improved  and  once again  the company experienced annual net aum inflows  a feat achieved every year since inception 
despite the difficult and challenging business environment that persists  the company believes it is well positioned for the future primarily as a result of our proven investment philosophy and above average risk adjusted investment performance 
our investment strategies  which emphasize a free cash flow analytical approach to the evaluation of equities  should continue to produce superior returns at a lower risk for our clients 
the company believes that free cash flow will be the analytical tool of choice for investors and share price performance will depend on which companies show operational efficiencies  control capital expenditures  and properly manage their cash flow  at a time when borrowing to fund growth or operations has tightened 
the emphasis on cash flow analysis has become increasingly relevant  as the use of accounting measures alone has proven to inadequately capture issues surrounding financial condition of many companies  particularly in the financial sector

nm not meaningful the company was not subject to regular income tax rates in fy because of its net operating loss carryforwards  but was obligated to pay tax under the federal alternative minimum tax amt  which limits the application of net operating loss carryforwards to of taxable income  in addition to certain amt adjustments 
the company was subject to regular income tax rates during fy  as the remaining net operating losses available to be utilized by the company are subject to annual limitations  and were less  in the aggregate  than were available in the prior year 
the total provision for income taxes in fy was significantly reduced by a release of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating cash flows are primarily influenced by the timing and receipt of investment management fees  and the payment of operating expenses  including cash incentive compensation to its employees 
investment management fees are generally collected within days of billing 
the company has traditionally paid cash incentive compensation during the first three months following the fiscal year to certain senior executives  and to other employees during the first three months following the calendar year 
commencing in the fiscal year ended june   the company began to pay cash incentive compensation to all employees during the first three months following the calendar year 
to implement such shift  the company utilized a six month stub period for those senior executives 
investing cash flows are principally influenced by activities to acquire property and equipment  re investment of earnings from investments in company sponsored products  and proceeds from other transactions 
financing cash flows are predominantly influenced by the payment of common stock dividends and the repurchase of the company s common stock 
the company has been making quarterly dividend payments on its common stock since the quarter ended december  the company remains committed to growing its business in this challenging market environment and expects that its main uses of cash will be to invest in new products  enhance its distribution network  pay quarterly dividends  acquire shares of its common stock when appropriate  enhance technology infrastructure  and pay corporate operating expenses  which are predominantly variable in nature and therefore fluctuate with revenue and aum 
the company continues to seek opportunities to prudently reduce its variable costs and discretionary spending wherever possible 
sources of liquidity sources of funds for the company s operations are derived from investment advisory and investment management fees  interest on the company s cash and cash equivalents  and sublease income 
as of june   the company had million of liquid assets  consisting of million of cash and cash equivalents and million of accounts receivable to fund its business growth strategy 
given the availability of these funds  the company does not maintain or anticipate a need for an external source of liquidity 

table of contents at june   accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which consist of trade payables  accrued professional fees  and other liabilities  were million 
accrued compensation and benefits  which consists primarily of accrued incentive compensation  was million 
the decrease in accrued incentive compensation from the prior year results from the timing of payments made for certain senior executives as previously indicated 
the company also realized excess tax benefits of million during the fiscal year ended june  excess tax benefits reduce the amount of income taxes to be paid 
excess tax benefits arise in connection with the company s stock compensation 
when a restricted stock award vests  the market price on the date the stock vests to the employee may be higher than the original grant date fair market value of the award 
if so  the difference between the cumulative amount that has been recognized through the statement of operations and the vesting amount results in an excess tax benefit 
excess tax benefits reduce income taxes payable and increase additional paid in capital in the period they are recognized 
there is no debt  and management does not foresee any reason to incur debt unless a significant business opportunity warrants such action 
the company s business does not require it to maintain significant capital balances 
management believes that the sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to meet the company s operating needs for the foreseeable future and will enable it to continue to implement its growth strategy
