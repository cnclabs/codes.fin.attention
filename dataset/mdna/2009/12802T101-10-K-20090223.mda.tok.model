we incur routine drydock  inspection  maintenance and repair costs pursuant to us coast guard regulations and in order to maintain our vessels in class under the rules of the applicable class society 
for  these costs were million 
we defer these costs and amortize over the period until the next regulatory drydock is required  which is generally months 
these costs can fluctuate widely from year to year based on the number of vessels  the scope of the related work plan  availability of drydock capacity and general prevailing market conditions 
in addition to complying with these requirements  we have our own vessel maintenance program that we believe permits us to continue to provide our customers with well maintained  reliable vessels 
in the normal course of business  we charter other vessels on a short term basis  such as tugboats  cargo barges  utility boats and dive support vessels

item legal proceedings insurance and legal proceedings our operations are subject to the inherent risks of offshore marine activity  including accidents resulting in personal injury and the loss of life or property  environmental mishaps  mechanical failures  fires and collisions 
we insure against these risks at levels consistent with industry standards 
we also carry workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  general liability and other insurance customary in our business 
all insurance is carried at levels of coverage and deductibles we consider financially prudent 
our services are provided in hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could occur  and litigation arising from such an event may result in our being named a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims 
although there can be no assurance the amount of insurance we carry is sufficient to protect us fully in all events  or that such insurance will continu e to be available at current levels of cost or coverage  we believe that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations 
a successful liability claim for which we are underinsured or uninsured could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  primarily involving claims for personal injury under the general maritime laws of the united states and the jones act as a result of alleged negligence 
in addition  we from time to time incur other claims  such as contract disputes  in the normal course of business 
under our agreements with helix  we have assumed and agreed to indemnify helix for liabilities related to our business 
tax assessment during the fourth quarter of  horizon received a tax assessment from the servicio de administracion tributaria sat  the mexican taxing authority  for approximately million related to fiscal  including penalties  interest and monetary correction 
the sat s assessment claims unpaid taxes related to services performed by our subsidiaries 
we believe under the mexico and united states double taxation treaty that these services are not taxable and the tax assessment itself is invalid 
on february   we received notice from the sat upholding the original assessment 
on april   we filed a petition in mexico tax court disputing the assessment 
we believe that our position is supported by law and intend to vigorously defend our position 
however  the ultimate outcome of this litigation and our potential liability from this assessment  if any  cannot be determined at this time 
nonetheless  an unfavorable outcome with respect to the mexico tax assessment could have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operation  and cash flows

this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
business and outlook the recent volatility in the equity and financial markets has led to increased uncertainty regarding the outlook for the global economy 
due to the deterioration of the credit markets and the ongoing challenges facing many financial institutions  businesses have intensified their focus on liquidity and access to capital 
this heightened uncertainty  a worldwide decrease in hydrocarbon demand  and a steep decline in commodity prices  have caused many oil and gas companies to curtail planned capital spending 
despite this financial market turmoil  we experienced strong demand for our services as reflected in our third and fourth quarter results 
this demand is in part driven by the need for inspection  repair and salvage of damaged platforms and infrastructure following hurricanes gustav and ike  which passed through the gulf of mexico in the third quarter given the volatility and uncertainty in the macro economic environment  it is difficult to predict to what extent these events will affect our overall activity level in generally  the long term outlook for our business remains favorable in both domestic and international markets as capital spending will be required to replenish oil and gas production which should drive long term demand for our services 
however  we do expect an overall decline in business activity levels in fiscal performance we earned net income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the harsh weather conditions in the gulf of mexico experienced in the first quarter of continued into the first two months of the second quarter of  and adversely impacted our overall us fleet utilization  particularly our construction barges and our surface diving fleet 
however  the majority of the us fleet returned to work offshore in june and our effective vessel utilization increased from during the second quarter to during the third quarter and during the fourth quarter of these activity levels in the third and fourth quarters produced record financial performance 
vessel utilization we believe vessel utilization is one of the most important performance measurements for our business 
as a marine contractor  our vessel utilization is typically lower during the winter and early spring due to winter weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
from through the first three quarters of fiscal  we did not experience the typical seasonal trends in our business due to the impact of hurricanes ivan  katrina and rita in the gulf of mexico 
however  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to experience a return to customary seasonal conditions as the amount of hurricane related repair activity decreased 
the seasonal impact on utilization during the first and second quarters of was considerable due to the weather conditions in the gulf of mexico region being harsher than normal while the expected seasonal impact during the fourth quarter of was la rgely offset by increased demand in the form of hurricane repair work as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike in september the following table shows the size of our fleet and effective utilization of our vessels during the past three fiscal years number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization saturation diving surface and mixed gas diving construction barges entire fleet as of the end of the period and excludes acquired vessels prior to their in service dates  vessels taken out of service prior to their disposition and vessels jointly owned by a third party 
effective vessel utilization is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels generated revenues by the total number of days the vessels were available for operation in each quarter and does not reflect acquired vessels prior to their in service dates  vessels in drydocking  vessels taken out of service for upgrades or prior to their disposition and vessels jointly owned by a third party 
excludes the nine vessels acquired from horizon on december  results of operations comparison of years ended and revenues 
for the year ended december   our revenues increased to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of revenue contributions from certain horizon assets acquired in december this increase was partially offset by lower vessel utilization related to winter seasonality and harsh weather conditions which continued into may gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increased gross profit derived from the horizon assets mentioned above  offset by the lower vessel utilization referred to above and increased depreciation and amortization 
the utilization impact from continued harsh weather in the gulf of mexico during the first five months of and adverse weather conditions thereafter was compounded by our increased exposure in terms of fleet size following the horizon acquisition 
cost of sales related depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due primarily to assets purchased in the horizon acquisition 
gross margins decreased to for the year e nded december  from in the year ended december  due to the factors noted above 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  were million higher than the million incurred in the year primarily due to the horizon acquisition  including non cash amortization of related intangible assets of million and one time integration costs of million  increased employee benefit costs and increased information technology costs 
selling and administrative expenses were of revenues for the year ended december   and of revenues for the year ended december  equity in loss of investment  inclusive of impairment charge 
during  we determined there was an other than temporary impairment in our minority ownership interest in offshore technology solutions limited  or otsl  and recorded an impairment charge equal to the carrying value of our investment of million 
net interest expense 
net interest expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is related to increased debt assumed in december in connection with the horizon acquisition 
income taxes 
income taxes were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the respective periods was for and for the rate decrease was primarily due to a higher percentage of profits being derived from foreign tax jurisdictions with lower tax rates in net income 
net income of million for the year ended december  was million more than net income of million for the year ended december  as a result of the factors described above 
comparison of years ended and revenues 
for the year ended december   our revenues increased to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of initial deployment of certain assets we acquired through the torch  acergy and fraser diving acquisitions subsequent to the first quarter of as well as the horizon assets acquired in late revenue derived from these assets was million in the year ended december   as compared to million in as an offset to this increase  we did not operate two vessels one owned and one chartered in that we operated in revenue from these two vessels in fiscal was million 
additionally  the increase was partially offset by an increased number of out of service days relating to regulatory dry docks and vessel upgrades during gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increased gross profit derived from the acquisitions mentioned above  offset by increased out of service days referred to above  lower vessel utilization as a result of seasonal weather in the fourth quarter of  and increased depreciation and deferred drydock amortization 
gross margins decreased to for the year ended december  from in the year ended december  due to the lower utilization and increased depreciation and amortization described above 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  were higher than the million incurred in the year ended december  primarily due to increased investment in international overhead and infrastructure  a million cash settlement with the department of justice related to the acergy and torch acquisitions and million in third party integration costs related to our acquisition of horizon 
selling and administrative expenses were also higher due to increased employee benefit insurance rates and new public company costs including investor relations  legal and audit expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were of revenues for the year ended december   and of revenues for the year ended december  equity in losses of investment  inclusive of impairment charge 
during  we determined that our remaining investment in otsl was impaired and recorded an impairment charge equal to the carrying value of our remaining investment 
for  equity in losses of investment  inclusive of impairment charge was million compared to million in net interest income expense 
net interest expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to net interest income of  in interest expense in is related to debt assumed in connection with our initial public offering in december and the term loan borrowings incurred in late as a result of the acquisition of horizon 
income taxes 
income taxes were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the respective periods was for and for net income 
net income of million for the year ended december  was million less than net income of million for the year ended december  as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources we require capital to fund ongoing operations  organic growth initiatives and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations  available cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility 
we intend to use these sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements  maintenance capital expenditures  strategic investments and acquisitions 
in connection with our business strategy  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities  including vessels and marine contracting businesses 
we believe that our liquidity will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our long term growth objectives 
we expect to be able to fund our activities for with cash flows generated from our operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in december  we entered into a five year million credit facility  which consists of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility  with certain financial institutions 
the revolving and term loans under this facility mature in december with quarterly principal payments of million being payable on the term loan 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million under this credit facility  million of cash on hand and million available under our revolving credit facility 
we may pay down or borrow from the revolving credit facility as business needs merit 
at december   we had issued and outstanding letters of credit of million under our revolving credit facility and million on an unsecured basis with another financial institution 
see credit facility 
in january  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to repurchase and retire  shares of our common stock from helix for per share  or million 
the repurchase price of per share was based on an approximate discount to the day average trading price as of january  the remaining million of cash borrowed but not used for the repurchase will be used to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes as needed 
our credit facility allows the repurchase of our common stock up to million in the aggregate 
as of february   we had outstanding debt of million under our credit facility  million cash on hand and million available under our credit facility 
we are closely monitoring the relatively recent and ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and have intensified our internal focus on liquidity  planned spending and access to capital 
externally we have also been engaged with our clients and the lending institutions on our credit facility as they have gone through a similar exercise 
while we believe at this stage it is relatively premature to accurately predict to what extent these current events may affect our overall activity levels in  we do expect a decrease in activity as compared to to date  we have received no communication from our lenders that they are unable or unwilling to fund any commitments under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  all participating banks party to our credit facility honored their commitments in january when we borrowed an additional million to fund the repurchase of our common stock from helix 
we also have reasonable visibility of our prospective cash flows supported by our backlog and the recent increased demand for our services following hurricanes gustav and ike  and believe that cash flows should be sufficient to fund our operations through the end of cash flows during the years ended december   and  we generated positive operating cash flow of approximately million  million and  respectively 
we utilized our operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures and recertification costs and to reduce our debt obligations 
for the years ended december   and  our cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  cash flow from operations net income other non cash income adjustments change in accounts receivable and other current assets change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities additions to deferred drydock costs other noncurrent  net total cash flow from operations other cash inflows net proceeds from drawdowns on credit facility proceeds from initial public offering net cash transfers from helix prior to initial public offering equity investment proceeds from sales of assets total other cash inflows other cash outflows acquisition of businesses  net of cash capital expenditures repayment on credit facility dividends paid to helix total other cash outflows net increase decrease in cash capital expenditures we incur capital expenditures for recertification costs relating to regulatory drydocks as well as costs for major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel s economic useful life 
inclusive of accrued costs  total capital expenditures incurred for these activities in include million for recertification costs and million relating to vessel improvements  steel and equipment replacement  equipment purchases and operating lease improvements 
for  we anticipate capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million for replacements and vessel improvements and million of recertification costs for regulatory drydocks 
we also may incur capital expenditures for strategic investments and acquisitions 
credit facility in december  we entered into a secured credit facility with certain financial institutions consisting of a million term loan  and a million revolving credit facility 
this credit facility replaced the revolving credit facility we entered into in november prior to our initial public offering 
the following is a summary description of the terms of the credit agreement and other loan documents 
the term loans and the revolving loans may consist of loans bearing interest in relation to the federal funds rate or to the lenders base rate  known as base rate loans  and loans bearing interest in relation to a libor rate  known as eurodollar rate loans  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the margins on the revolving loans range from to on base rate loans and to on eurodollar rate loans 
the margins on the term loan are on base rate loans and on eurodollar rate loans 
the revolving loans and the term loan mature on december   with quarterly principal payments of million being payable on the term loan 
we may prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan without prepayment penalty 
in addition  a commitment fee ranging from to will be payable on the portion of the lenders aggregate commitment which from time to time is not used for a borrowing or a letter of credit 
margins on the revolving loans and the commitment fee will fluctuate in relation to our consolidated leverage ratio as provided in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement and the other documents entered into in connection with the credit facility include terms and conditions  including covenants  that we consider customary for this type of transaction 
the covenants include restrictions on our ability to grant liens  incur indebtedness  make investments  merge or consolidate  sell or transfer assets and pay dividends 
in addition  the credit agreement obligates us to meet minimum financial requirements specified in the agreement 
the credit facility is secured by vessel mortgages on all of our vessels except for the sea horizon  a pledge of all of the stock of all of our domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of two of our foreign subsidiaries  and a security interest in  among other things  all of our equipment  inventory  accounts and general intangible assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
on december   we borrowed million under the term loan and used those proceeds to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration in connection with our acquisition of horizon and to retire horizon s and our existing debt 
we had no borrowings outstanding  and letters of credit totaling million to secure performance bonds outstanding  under our revolving credit facility at december  at december   there was million available under the revolving credit facility 
on january   we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to fund the repurchase of  shares of our common stock from helix 
as of february   we have million available under the revolving credit facility 
we expect to use the remaining availability under the revolving credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes as needed 
contractual and other obligations we lease several facilities and accommodations for certain employees located outside the us under noncancelable operating leases 
total rental expense under these operating leases was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   our contractual obligations for long term debt and payables and operating leases were as follows payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands long term tax payable to helix noncancelable operating leases and charters long term financing obligations principal interest interest rate swap total contractual obligations assumes an interest rate based on three month libor at december  plus a margin of and commitment fees of on unused portion of revolver 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
for information regarding our principles of consolidation  see note to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and policies our accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated and combined financial statements 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in our financial statements and related notes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors that could affect the ongoing viability of our business and our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are those described below 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
revenue recognition we determine the appropriate accounting method for each of our contracts at the beginning of the project and recognize revenue according to the type of contract 
most of our revenues are derived from contracts that have a short duration 
these contracts contain either qualified lump sum turnkey provisions or provisions for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
we recognize revenue as it is earned as described below at estimated collectible amounts 
revenues generated from specific time  materials and equipment contracts are generally earned on a dayrate basis and recognized as amounts are earned in accordance with contract terms 
revenue on significant turnkey contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we follow the guidelines of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the use of this method is based on our experience and history of being able to prepare reasonably dependable estimates of the cost to complete our projects 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors may affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  delay the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings on a current basis 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when it is first determined as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
we recognize additional contract revenue related to claims when the cla im is probable and legally enforceable 
although we constantly seek to improve our ability to estimate contract costs and profitability  adjustments to total contract costs due to unanticipated events could be significant in future periods 
property and equipment we record our property and equipment at cost 
we depreciate our assets primarily on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
our estimates of useful lives of our assets are as follows vessels to years  portable saturation diving systems  machinery and equipment five to years  and buildings and leasehold improvements four to years 
major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel s economic useful life or functional operating capability  are capitalized and depreciated over the vessel s remaining economic useful life 
we expense the costs of repairs and maintenance which do not materially prolong the useful life of the property and equipment as incurred 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
the accounting rules generally accepted in the united states of america require us to continually monitor our business and the business environment to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that property and equipment may be impaired 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
our marine vessels are assessed on a vessel by vessel basis 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  we write down the asset to its fair value and recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on management s estimate of discounted cash flows the asset will generate in the future 
we recorded no impairment charges to property and equipment in  and recertification costs and deferred drydock charges our vessels are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time 
typically  these recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock 
we defer and amortize drydock and related recertification costs over the length of time for which we expect to receive benefits from the drydock and related recertification  which is generally months 
vessels are typically available to earn revenue for the month period between drydock and related recertification processes 
a drydock and related recertification process typically lasts one to two months  a period during which the vessel is not available to earn revenue 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually 
in certain circumstances  we also test for impairment of goodwill between annual tests  including but not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  emergence of unanticipated competition  or loss of key personnel 
we test for the impairment of other intangible assets when impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions are present 
our goodwill impairment test is based on our single operating unit and reporting unit structure  and involves a comparison of our estimated fair value with our carrying amount  including goodwill 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized if the carrying amount of our net assets exceeds our estimated fair value 
our fair value is calculated by a combination of the discounted cash flow method and other market methods 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow and other market models to forecast operating cash flows  including projected revenue growth  operating profit margin percentages  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate  and terminal values 
a variance in forecasted cash flows or in the assumed discount rate could have a significant effect on our impairment test in future periods 
our estimates of cash flows may differ fr om actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions and offshore exploration  development and production activity in the oil and natural gas industry 
any changes in such factors may negatively affect our business and result in a future goodwill impairment 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november   and goodwill was not impaired 
we will continue to test our goodwill annually on a consistent measurement date unless events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce our fair value below its carrying amount 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the current provision for income tax is based upon the current tax laws and our interpretation of these laws  as well as the probable outcomes of any foreign or domestic tax audits 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we compute deferred income taxes using the liability method 
we provide for deferred income taxes on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of its assets and liabilities by applying enacted statuto ry tax rates  applicable to future years 
allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions to the provisions for income taxes 
our most significant judgments on tax related matters include  but are not limited to  tax valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 
these matters involve the exercise of significant judgment which could change and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
the realization of our deferred tax assets depends on recognition of sufficient future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions during periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be recovered 
in evaluating our valuation allowance  we consider the reversal of existing temporary differences  the existence of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies and future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions  the latter two of which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
changes to our valuation allowance could materially impact our results of operations 
we have liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions connected with ongoing examinations and open tax years 
changes in our assessment of these liabilities may require us to increase the liability and record additional tax expense or reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit which would positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate 
we do not provide for us income taxes on foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings intended to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 
prior to december   our operations were included in a consolidated federal income tax return filed by helix 
for financial reporting purposes  our provision for income taxes has been computed on the basis that we have completed and filed separate federal income tax returns for all periods presented 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices  customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies 
depending on how these issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
loss contingencies we accrue loss contingency reserves when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of our liabilities are based on an evaluation of potential outcomes and currently available facts 
we attempt to resolve these matters through settlements  mediation and arbitration proceedings when possible 
actual results may differ from our estimates  and our estimates can be revised in the future  either negatively or positively  depending upon actual outcomes or changes in expectations based on the facts surrounding each matter

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management we are exposed to market risks in our normal business activities 
market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with existing or forecasted financial transactions 
the types of market risks we are exposed are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility 
changes based on the floating interest rates under this facility could result in an increase or decrease in our annual interest expense and related cash outlay 
to reduce the impact of this market risk  in april we entered into a two year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to convert a portion of our anticipated variable rate interest payments to fixed rate interest payments 
this interest rate swap effectively fixes our variable interest payments made on million of our variable rate term loan  or as of december   at 
the impact of this market risk is estimated using a hypothetical increase and decrease in interest rates by basis points in thousands increase of basis points in interest rates decrease of basis points in interest rates fair value fair value impact on annual interest expense fair value impact on annual interest expense impact of interest rate change on variable rate debt december  december  impact of interest rate change on interest rate swap liability december  december  hypothetical net impact on annual interest expense december  december  foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have operations in foreign locations that subject us to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
although the vast majority of our business is transacted in us dollars  we transact some business in euro dollars  mexican pesos  singapore dollars  and australian dollars  among others 
historically  foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material to our business 
as we continue to grow our international operations  foreign currency exchange rate risk may become more significant and we may mitigate our foreign currency risk with foreign currency derivative instruments in the future
