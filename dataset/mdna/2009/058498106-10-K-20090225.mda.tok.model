item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball or the company or we or our in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview ball corporation is one of the world s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage  food and household products industries 
our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world 
we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 
we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage  food and household products companies with which we have developed long term customer relationships 
this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts 
while we have a diversified customer base  we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america  europe  the people s republic of china prc and argentina  as do our equity joint ventures in brazil  the us and the prc 
we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers 
because of our customer and supplier concentration  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier  although our contracts and long term relationships help us to mitigate those risks in the majority of circumstances 
in the rigid packaging industry  sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs  increasing prices  developing new products and expanding volume 
over the past two years  we have closed several packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand 
we have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our worldwide beverage can business 
while the north american beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature  the european  prc and brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term 
while we are able to capitalize on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our european can manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion  we have put on hold various projects  including the completion of the construction of the poland plant and new construction in india  due to the current world wide economic environment 
we are proceeding with the recently announced new one line metal beverage can plant in our brazil joint venture and are adding further can capacity in the existing brazilian can plant 
these brazilian expansion efforts will be owned by ball s unconsolidated percent owned joint venture  latapack ball embalagens  ltda  and the expansion is being funded by cash flows from operations and incurrence of debt by the joint venture 
as part of our packaging strategy  we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer 
these innovations include new shapes  sizes  opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging 
this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage  food and household products customers 
as part of this focus  we installed a new aluminum bottle line  as well as a ounce beverage can production line in our monticello  indiana  facility  both of which became operational during the third quarter of ball s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments  as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk within item a of this report 
page of the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 
it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities  or changes in agency budgets  could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance 
we expect that the delay of certain program awards  as well as federal budget considerations under the new administration  will have an unfavorable impact on this segment in  and we are taking steps to adjust our resources accordingly 
we recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost to cost  percentage of completion method of accounting 
our present contract mix consists of approximately two thirds percent cost type contracts  which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon and or earned profit component  while the remainder are fixed price contracts 
we include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates 
failure to be awarded certain key contracts could further adversely affect segment performance during compared to throughout the period of contract performance  we regularly reevaluate and  if necessary  revise our estimates of batc s total contract revenue  total contract cost and progress toward completion 
because of contract payment schedules  limitations on funding and other contract terms  our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 
management uses various measures to evaluate company performance 
the primary financial metric we use is economic value added tax effected operating earnings  as defined by the company  less a charge for net operating assets employed 
our goal is to increase economic value added on an annual basis 
other financial metrics we use are earnings before interest and taxes ebit  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  diluted earnings per share  operating cash flow and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures 
these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods 
nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production efficiency and spoilage rates  quality control figures  environmental  health and safety statistics and production and sales volumes 
additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization  award and incentive fees realized  proposal win rates and backlog including awarded  contracted and funded backlog 
we recognize that attracting  developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of ball and  because of this  we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio 
for most management employees  a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive  dependent upon economic value added operating performance 
for more senior positions  more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various stock compensation plans 
through our employee stock purchase plan and k plan  which matches employee contributions with ball common stock  employees  regardless of organizational level  have opportunities to own ball stock 
consolidated sales and earnings the company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines  after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics metal beverage packaging  americas and asia  metal beverage packaging  europe  metal food and household products packaging  americas  plastic packaging  americas  and aerospace and technologies 
we also have investments in companies in the us  the prc and brazil  which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and  accordingly  those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 
due to first quarter management reporting changes  ball s operations in the prc with net sales of million are now aggregated and included in the metal beverage packaging  americas and asia  segment previously included within the company s european operations 
also  effective january   a plastic pail product line with net sales of million was transferred from the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment to the plastic packaging  americas  segment 
prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to the current presentation 
page of metal beverage packaging  americas and asia the metal beverage packaging  americas and asia  segment consists of operations located in the us  canada  puerto rico through fiscal year and the prc  which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as non beverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the prc 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in  including the impact from the million legal settlement with miller discussed below  and percent in 
excluding the effect of the legal settlement  sales were percent lower in than in  primarily as a result of decreases in north american sales volumes of approximately percent 
the decrease in north american sales volumes was due primarily to lower unit volume sales to carbonated soft drink customers  consistent with the industry  and lost beer sales volumes on discontinuance of a contract that did not provide sufficient profitability 
this decrease was somewhat offset by sales volume increases in the prc of percent during sales were percent higher in than in percent higher including the effect from the legal settlement with flat volumes being offset by higher sales prices  which were primarily due to rising aluminum prices and the pass through of various cost increases to customers 
based on publicly available information  we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately percent of total us and canadian shipments and percent of total prc shipments in we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business  which includes cans of different shapes  diameters and fill volumes  and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions 
during the second quarter of  miller asserted various claims against a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers supplied by the subsidiary  and on october   the dispute was settled in mediation 
miller received million million after tax on settlement of the dispute  and ball retained all of miller s beverage can and end supply through miller received a one time payment of million million after tax in january recorded on the december   consolidated balance sheet in other current liabilities with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract  which extends through on july   miller s business was combined with the us business of coors brewing company  which we also supply  to form millercoors  llc 
segment earnings in were million million excluding business consolidation costs discussed in more detail below compared to million million excluding the legal settlement in and million in excluding the million in business consolidation charges in and million settlement in  earnings in were lower than in by percent  primarily due to raw material inventory gains of million realized in  which did not recur in earnings in were also negatively impacted by lower north american sales volumes  which were partially offset by the higher sales volumes in the prc 
positive cost impacts from a new end technology project commenced in and other cost optimization measures partially offset the prior year non recurring inventory gain and the unfavorable net sales volume decreases 
the higher segment earnings in  before the legal settlement  compared to were due to raw material inventory gains in that exceeded by approximately million 
also contributing were approximately million of lower manufacturing costs related to the new end technology project and improved production efficiencies 
these gains were offset by increased repair and maintenance costs and higher labor and other conversion costs  a portion of which could not be passed through to our customers 
on april   ball announced that by the end of it would close a metal beverage packaging plant in kent  washington  and in recorded pretax charges of million million after tax  including the sale of the plant facility in the fourth quarter 
the closure of the kent facility is expected to result in net fixed costs savings of approximately million in also in the second quarter of  a gain of million million after tax was recorded for the recovery of previously expensed pension  employee severance and other benefit closure obligation costs no longer required 
this reflects a decision made in the second quarter to continue to operate existing end making equipment and not install a new beverage can end module that would have been part of our multi year project 
on october   ball announced the closure of two north american metal beverage can plants 
a plant in kansas city  missouri  which primarily manufactures specialty beverage cans  will be closed by the end of the first quarter  with manufacturing volumes absorbed by other north american beverage can plants 
a plant in puerto rico  which manufactured ounce beverage cans  was closed at the end of a pretax charge of page of approximately million million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter of with an additional million million after tax expected in cost reductions associated with these plant closings are expected to be up to million in and be million cash positive upon final disposition of the assets 
metal beverage packaging  europe the metal beverage packaging  europe  segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured in europe 
ball packaging europe  which represents an estimated percent of total european metal beverage container manufacturing capacity  has manufacturing plants located in germany  the united kingdom  france  the netherlands  poland and serbia  and is the second largest metal beverage container business in europe 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in and percent in 
segment sales in as compared to were percent higher due largely to approximately percent higher sales volume  consistent with overall market growth  higher sales prices and foreign currency sales gains of percent on the strength of the euro 
these positive impacts were offset by certain small unfavorable cost changes  including product mix changes towards smaller containers 
segment sales in were percent higher than in  due primarily to over percent higher sales volume  higher sales prices and foreign currency sales gains of percent on the strength of the euro 
higher segment volumes in both periods were aided by the growth in europe of specialty can volumes  including the successful introduction of the ball sleek can into italy 
the slow return of the metal beverage can to the german market  following the mandatory deposit legislation previously reported on  is being offset by stronger demand outside germany 
segment earnings were million in  million in and million million excluding a million property insurance gain in earnings in were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of million due to the combined impact of the increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives  which exceeded the negative impact from product mix  as well as approximately million related to a stronger euro 
these improvements were partially offset by million of higher other costs including a negative foreign exchange impact from the conversion of the british pound to the euro and million for business interruption recoveries in that were not repeated in for further details see below 
earnings in compared to  excluding the million property insurance gain received in due to a fire at the company s hassloch  germany  metal beverage can plant further details are provided below  were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of million due to the combined impact of increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives  million from cost control programs and million related to a stronger euro 
these improvements were partially offset by million of other higher costs and million of lower business interruption insurance recognition in on april   a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch  germany  damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment 
the property insurance proceeds recorded for the combined years ended december  and  which were based on replacement cost  were million million 
a million million fixed asset write down was recorded to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the fire 
as a result  a pretax gain of million million was recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property insurance proceeds 
an additional million million and million million were recorded in cost of sales in and  respectively  for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs  as well as million million in to offset clean up costs 
metal food and household products packaging  americas the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us  canada and argentina 
the company acquired us can corporation us can on march   and with that acquisition  added to its metal food can business the production and sale of aerosol cans  paint cans  plastic pails and decorative specialty cans 
effective january   responsibility for the plastic pail product line  with net sales of million  was transferred to the plastic packaging  americas  segment 
accordingly  segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer 
page of this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in and percent in 
segment sales in increased percent as compared to mostly due to higher selling prices offset by an approximate percent decrease in sales volumes primarily as a result of decisions by management to discontinue low margin business  which led to the announced closure of our commerce  california  and tallapoosa  georgia  facilities in we estimate our shipments account for approximately percent and percent of total annual us and canadian steel food container and steel aerosol container shipments  respectively 
segment sales in increased percent as compared to due to an approximate percent increase in sales for the inclusion of a full year s sales from the acquisition of us can  partially offset by a percent decline in sales from lost business  as well as customer operating issues in food cans  including a fire in a customer s factory  and unfavorable weather conditions in the midwest 
segment earnings were million million excluding a million gain from business consolidation activities in  compared to a loss of million earnings of million excluding business consolidation costs of million in and earnings of million million excluding business consolidation costs of million in excluding the business consolidation activities for each period  earnings in exceeded by approximately percent primarily related to improved pricing  better manufacturing performance and the settlement of a claim in the amount of almost million offset by the negative impact of percent lower sales volumes in the percent lower earnings in compared to  excluding the business consolidation charges  were primarily related to increased steel and coating material costs  partially offset by improved manufacturing performance in and higher cost of sales in the second quarter of related to million of purchase accounting adjustments for inventory valuations associated with the acquired us can finished goods inventory 
while pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials  other direct materials and freight and utility costs  we continue to seek price increases in the market place 
in october  ball announced plans to close aerosol manufacturing plants in tallapoosa  georgia  and commerce  california  and announced its intent to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business located in baltimore  maryland 
a pretax charge of million million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter of primarily related to these closures 
ball incurred additional net pretax charges of million primarily related to lease cancellation costs for the closure of the commerce facility during additionally  during the fourth quarter of  it was determined  based on market conditions that we would remain in the custom and decorative tinplate can business  which resulted in the reversal of million in business consolidation charges previously recorded 
we closed the tallapoosa facility early in the first quarter of and do not anticipate further charges related to this closure 
when completed in  the actions are expected to yield annualized pretax cost savings in excess of million and improve the aerosol plant utilization rate to more than percent from about percent 
the cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of the realignment of the metal food and household products packaging  americas  segment  a charge of million million after tax was recorded primarily related to the closure of a plant in burlington  ontario  for employee termination and pension costs  plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment charges 
the burlington plant was sold during the third quarter of completing the restructuring plan  except for pension costs  which resulted in an additional million in business consolidation charges 
as reported in our second quarter form q  during the third quarter our aerosol business experienced a tinplate supply issue due to a major supplier s failure to deliver committed metal 
while this matter affected a limited  seasonal part of this segment s product mix  it caused a supply disruption with some of our customers that resulted in lost sales and profitability for ball during the year 
we have made every effort to fulfill our customers requests and minimize the impact on our customer base 
we are now receiving the necessary tinplate to produce products for our customers  and future raw material supply arrangements are scheduled 
plastic packaging  americas the plastic packaging  americas  segment consists of operations located in the us and canada through most of the third quarter of  which manufacture pet and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging  as well as high density polyethylene and polypropylene containers for industrial and household product applications 
on march   ball acquired certain north american plastic bottle container page of assets from alcan packaging alcan  including two plastic container manufacturing plants in the us and one in canada  as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from other alcan facilities 
effective january   the plastic packaging  americas  segment assumed responsibility for plastic pail assets acquired as part of the us can acquisition 
accordingly  segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer 
manufacturing operations ceased in canada during the third quarter of with the closure of the brampton  ontario  plant 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in both and 
segment sales in decreased percent  or approximately million  as compared to due to a decrease of approximately percent in sales volume offset by higher raw material cost increases passed through to customers during the volume loss included decreases in carbonated soft drink and water bottle sales due  in part  to lower convenience store sales by our customers  which were partially offset by higher sales in specialty business markets eg  custom hot fill  alcohol  food and juice drinks 
reduced preform sales also contributed to the sales decrease due  in part  to the bankruptcy filing of a preform customer 
segment sales in increased percent as compared to primarily due to an increase in sales of percent related to the march acquisition of alcan and the inclusion of the acquired us can plastic pail business  as well as an increase of percent for higher sales volumes related to the legacy business 
segment earnings were million in  million in and million in excluding the business consolidation charges of million in further details are provided below and million in  earnings in were lower than in by approximately percent primarily due to the previously mentioned volume losses and a million charge due to a customer bankruptcy filing during the second quarter of earnings in were lower than in primarily due to lower sales margins related to approximately million of customer pricing concessions and million of higher labor and overhead costs 
the earnings inhibitors were partially offset by approximately million from volume growth in specialty pet sales combined with the incremental margin impact of sales in the first quarter of related to the acquired alcan and us can plants 
in view of the low pet margins  we continue to focus our efforts on price and margin recovery initiatives  as well as pet development efforts in the custom hot fill  beer  wine  flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets 
in the polypropylene plastic container arena  development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging markets 
we estimate our shipments of pet plastic bottles to be approximately percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments 
in addition the plastic packaging  americas  segment shipped approximately million polypropylene food and specialty containers during on june   ball announced the closure of a plastic packaging manufacturing plant in brampton  ontario  which ceased operations in the third quarter of a pretax charge of million million after tax was recorded during for employee termination and other benefit costs  lease cancellation costs and fixed asset impairment 
the brampton operations have been consolidated into the company s other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in the united states  and the closure of this facility is expected to result in annual  fixed cost savings of approximately million beginning in aerospace and technologies aerospace and technologies segment sales represented percent of consolidated net sales in percent in and percent in 
segment sales in were percent lower as compared to as a result of a combination of large programs nearing completion  program terminations  delays in program awards and government funding constraints 
the reductions were partially offset by new program starts and increased scope on previously awarded contracts 
segment sales in were percent higher than in due to new programs  cost overruns on fixed price contracts  increased scope on previously awarded contracts and growth in our commercial contracts 
some of the segment s high profile contracts include the worldview advanced commercial remote sensing satellites  the james webb space telescope  a successor to the hubble space telescope  the space based space surveillance system  which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris  npoess  the next generation satellite weather monitoring system  and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter 
page of segment earnings in were million million excluding the sale of an australian subsidiary discussed in more detail below  million in and million in excluding the pretax gain on the sale of bsg of million in the first quarter of  earnings in were up percent in comparison to earnings improved year over year as the sales volume decline described above was more than offset by improved margins on contracts due to improvements in program execution  risk retirement on several fixed price programs  as well as a reduction of unreimbursable pension and benefit expenses 
earnings improvement in as compared to was primarily due to higher net sales  particularly related to the worldview and other commercial space contracts  an improved contract mix and better program execution 
on february   ball completed the sale of its shares in bsg to qinetiq pty ltd for approximately million  including cash sold of million 
bsg provided services to the australian department of defense and related government agencies 
after an adjustment for working capital items  the sale resulted in a pretax gain of million 
sales to the us government  either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor  represented percent of segment sales in  percent in and percent in contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
additional segment information for additional information regarding the company s segments  see the summary of business segment information in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time 
if actual outcomes vary from the estimates  the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses 
additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
undistributed corporate expenses  net undistributed corporate expenses  net  were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
included in the undistributed corporate expenses for was million for mark to market losses related to aluminum derivative instruments that will reverse and result in a gain in these aluminum derivative instruments are fully matched with customer sales arrangements that mature in  therefore  the mark to market losses will reverse in resulting in million of pretax earnings 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decreases in sg a expenses in compared to were due to million of lower general and administrative costs as a result of the sale in february of the aerospace and technologies segment s australian subsidiary  lower aerospace research and development costs and bid and proposal costs of million  life insurance death benefits of million  settlement of a claim for approximately million  the favorable net year over year change in foreign currency hedges and exchange impacts of million and other miscellaneous net cost reductions 
the increase in sg a expenses in compared to were million of additional sg a from the us can acquisition  higher research and development costs and aerospace bid and proposal costs of million  increased sales and marketing efforts of million and million of compensation and benefit increases  including year over year incentive compensation costs 
for the us pension plans  we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption of percent and our discount rate assumption of percent for based on these assumptions and excluding curtailment expense  us pension expense for is anticipated to increase million compared to  most of which will be included in cost of sales 
pension expense in europe and canada combined is expected to be comparable to the expense 
a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage page of point would result in an approximate million increase in the pension expense  while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated million of additional pension expense in additional information regarding the company s pension plans is provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
interest and taxes consolidated interest expense was million in  million in and million in the reduced expense in was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt  as us and european central banks cut interest rates amid the global financial crisis 
the higher expense in as compared to was primarily due to the additional borrowings used to finance the acquisitions of us can and the alcan assets  combined with higher interest rates in ball s consolidated effective income tax rate for was percent compared to percent in and percent in the lower tax rate in as compared to and was primarily the result of earnings mix higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and net tax benefit adjustments of million recorded in additionally  the inability to fully use canadian net operating losses on plant closures in and contributed to higher rates in those years 
the rate was partially reduced by a million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of for an enacted tax law change in the united kingdom  which was offset by the impact of non deductible losses in the cash surrender value of certain company owned life insurance plans 
the million net reduction in the tax provision was primarily a result of enacted income tax rate reductions in germany and the united kingdom and a tax loss related to the company s canadian operations  which were offset by an increase in the tax provision in to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded with the internal revenue service irs related to a company owned life insurance plan discussed below 
based on current estimates  the effective income tax rate is expected to be around percent 
during the company concluded final settlement negotiations with the irs on the deductibility of interest expense on incurred loans from a company owned life insurance plan 
an additional accrual of million was made in the third quarter of to adjust the accrued liability to the final settlement of million  including interest  for the years  which were under examination  and for the unaudited years this settlement included agreement on the prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans  which will not have a significant impact on earnings per share  cash flow or liquidity in future periods 
further details are available in note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
results of equity affiliates equity in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our percent ownership in packaging investments in the us and brazil 
earnings were million in  million in and million in critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements for information regarding the company s critical and significant accounting policies  as well as recent accounting pronouncements  see note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term and committed revolver borrowings  when necessary  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements  scheduled principal and interest payments on debt  dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures 
we had in excess of half a billion dollars of available funds under committed multi currency revolving credit facilities at december  however  our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products  which could arise from competitive circumstances  the current global credit  financial and economic crisis or any of the other factors we describe in item a  risk factors 
page of in our worldwide beverage can business  we use financial derivative contracts as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk within item a of this report to manage future aluminum price volatility for our customers 
as these derivative contracts are matched to customer sales contracts  they have little or no economic impact on our earnings 
ball s financial counterparties to these derivative contracts require ball to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark to market value of the contracts exceeds specified levels 
additionally  ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with certain customers and other financial counterparties on these derivative contracts 
at december   ball had million of cash posted as collateral and had received million of cash from customers for a net amount of million 
the cash flows of the collateral postings are shown in the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
assuming aluminum prices remain unchanged  we would expect to recover all of these cash deposits in cash flows provided by operations were million in compared to million in and million in the reduction in as compared to was primarily due to the payment of approximately million in january of a legal settlement to a customer 
this reduction was partially offset by the net impact of increases in net earnings and depreciation  lower tax payments  lower pension contributions and a net increase in working capital during the year 
the improvement in as compared to was primarily due to higher net earnings before the legal settlement in and the insurance gain in related to the hassloch fire 
the improvement in was also the result of reduced changes in working capital components and lower income tax payments  partially offset by higher pension contributions 
management internally uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company s operating results  to plan stock buy back levels  to evaluate strategic investments and to evaluate the company s ability to incur and service debt 
free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles  and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures 
the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment capital spending 
free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company s cash flow statements  however  it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 
an example of such an item included the company s decision in to contribute an additional million million after tax to its pension plans 
additional examples include property insurance proceeds for the replacement of the fire damaged assets in our hassloch  germany  plant  which are included in capital spending amounts in based on this  our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows in millions cash flows from operating activities capital spending proceeds for replacement of fire damaged assets incremental pension funding  net of tax free cash flow based on information currently available  we estimate cash flows from operating activities for to be approximately million  capital spending to be approximately million and free cash flow to be in the million range 
capital spending of million in exceeded depreciation and amortization expense of million 
we have reduced our expected capital spending year over year  and we do not intend to buy back stock until the capital markets show sufficient signs of recovery 
initially in we will focus on reducing our debt and growing our cash balances 
debt facilities and refinancing interest bearing debt at december   increased million to billion from billion at december  the debt increase from was primarily due to the financing of million in net cash collateral deposits 
in we intend to allocate our operating cash flow to reducing our debt and growing our cash balances while covering our capital spending programs  dividends and incremental pension funding 
at december   million was available under the company s multi currency revolving credit facilities 
the company also had million of short term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year  of which million was outstanding 
the committed credit facilities are available until october page of given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until october  the company s liquidity is strong and is expected to meet its ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements 
while the current financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions  the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties  thus limiting exposure with any one party 
the company also monitors the credit ratings of its suppliers  customers  lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 
the current financial and economic environment has exacerbated liquidity and credit risks with some of our customers and suppliers 
in october  we advanced interest bearing funding of million in support of one of our key suppliers  which advance is secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
the company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing  revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball s north american packaging operations up to million 
the agreement qualifies as off balance sheet financing under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company was in compliance with all loan agreements at december   and all prior years presented  and has met all debt payment obligations 
the us note agreements  bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends  investments  financial ratios  guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
additional details about the company s debt and receivables sales agreements are available in notes and  respectively  accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
other liquidity items cash payments required for long term debt maturities  rental payments under noncancellable operating leases  purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december   are summarized in the following table payments due by period a in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations interest payments on long term debt b operating leases purchase obligations c total payments on contractual obligations a amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at the year end exchange rates 
b for variable rate facilities  amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of hedging instruments 
c the company s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum  steel  plastic resin and other direct materials 
also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity  aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items 
in cases where variable prices and or usage are involved  management s best estimates have been used 
depending on the circumstances  early termination of the contracts may not result in penalties and  therefore  actual payments could vary significantly 
page of contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans  not including the unfunded german plans  may be in the range of million to million in this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance  among other factors

page of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management in the ordinary course of business  we employ established risk management policies and procedures  which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  foreign currencies and prices of the company s common stock in regard to common share repurchases  although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful 
although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit  market and interest risk  the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 
the company monitors counterparty credit risk  including lenders  on a regular basis  but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective 
we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis 
market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments  financial instruments and commodity positions 
to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure  we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices or rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
commodity price risk we manage our north american commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingot based pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet purchases 
the terms include fixed  floating or pass through aluminum ingot component pricing 
this matched pricing affects most of our north american metal beverage packaging net sales 
we also  at times  use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass through arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 
most of the plastic packaging  americas  sales contracts include provisions to fully pass through resin cost changes 
as a result  we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin 
most metal food and household products packaging  americas  sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur  or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs 
in and in  we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of steel cost increases 
we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur over the next months 
in europe and the prc  the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long term contracts for the purchase of the materials  as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year 
these purchase and sales contracts include fixed price  floating and pass through pricing arrangements 
we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement to minimize the company s exposure to significant price changes 
considering the effects of derivative instruments  the company s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions  the market s ability to accept price increases and the company s commodity price exposures under its contract terms  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the company s steel  aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
additionally  if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by percent  we estimate there could be an million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity  as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost 
a hypothetical percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices  without considering such pass through provisions  could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings page of over a one year period 
a hypothetical percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
subsequent to year end  the company has taken further steps to reduce its exposure to natural gas and diesel fuel prices in interest rate risk our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we use a variety of interest rate swaps  collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
interest rate instruments held by the company at december   included pay fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars 
pay fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 
collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate 
based on our interest rate exposure at december   assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next months and the effects of derivative instruments  a basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts 
in addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies  and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company s earnings 
our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro  british pound  canadian dollar  polish zloty  chinese renminbi  hong kong dollar  brazilian real  argentine peso and serbian dinar 
we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and  where there is not a foreign exchange pass through arrangement  the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 
we additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the company s european operations into us dollars 
considering the company s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december   and the currency exposures  a hypothetical percent reduction us dollar strengthening in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated million after tax reduction in net earnings over a one year period 
this amount includes the million currency exposure discussed above in the commodity price risk section 
this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by million 
actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 
common share repurchases as part of the company s ongoing share repurchase program and as a way to partially reduce the earnings volatility of the company s variable deferred compensation stock program  from time to time the company sells equity put options on its common stock 
the company currently has  shares of equity put options outstanding at a strike price of per share that expire in less than months 
on december   ball entered into a forward repurchase agreement for the purchase of  shares of its common stock 
this agreement was settled for million on january   and the shares were delivered that day 
on december   we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for approximately million 
the agreement provided for the delivery of  shares  which represented percent of the total estimated shares to ultimately be delivered 
the million was paid on january   at the time the shares were delivered 
the agreement was settled on july   and the company received an additional  shares
