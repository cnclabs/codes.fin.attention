item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in the context of this overview 
general economic and industry wide factors throughout fiscal years and  our businesses were affected by declines in the us housing and construction markets 
the worldwide credit and financial crisis  along with a slowdown in the global economy  affected sales volume in all of our product lines during at the same time  many of our raw material costs declined from their historical highs of due to weak market conditions 
as fiscal progressed  raw material costs began to rise again as crude oil and other feedstock prices recovered 
raw material costs are still above trend lines from the early part of this decade 
we expect raw material costs to continue to rise in fiscal year in response to the market conditions in fiscal year we took the following actions expanded our restructuring actions that started in to lower our cost structure and further increase our operational efficiency 
the main focus of our actions was in our coatings segment  which is largely comprised of product lines most directly affected by the economic slowdown 
enhanced our liquidity by issuing  of unsecured  senior notes that mature on june  with a coupon rate of and establishing a new  three year credit facility 
managed working capital to maximize cash flow  with a particular focus on lowering our inventory levels and minimizing accounts receivable write offs 
in addition  despite the difficult economic environment  we did the following continued to invest in our brands and technologies  which enabled us to gain new business in most of our product lines 
made aggregate pension contributions of  to maintain appropriate funding levels 
increased our dividend for the nd consecutive year 
business performance net sales decreased to  from  in  primarily driven by lower volume 
we were able to partially offset volume declines with new business in most of our product lines 
despite the challenging economic climate  our earnings increased for the year due to a combination of improved raw material cost comparisons  previous customer price increases  improved efficiency in our operations resulting from previously completed restructuring actions that began in fiscal year  productivity initiatives and effective control of expenses 
sales in our coatings segment decreased significantly  reflecting continued weakness in industrial markets 
despite the volume declines  we reduced our cost structure  which allowed us to remain profitable in all product lines in this segment 
the us architectural market continued to decline in  however  sales growth in our architectural product line outperformed this market 
we believe this is due to increased brand awareness and a consumer shift from the professional channel to the do it yourself channel 
our global presence remained strong 
international sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales 
during the third quarter of  we initiated a comprehensive series of actions to lower our cost structure and further increase our operational efficiency 
during the first quarter of  we expanded these restructuring activities 
we expect the total restructuring cost to be to per share after tax 
restructuring activities during resulted in pre tax charges of  or per share after tax 
restructuring activities during resulted in pre tax charges of  or per share after tax 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on restructuring 
during the year  we generated  in free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends  an increase of  from  and reduced our total debt  including notes payable  by  our liquidity position is strong  with  in cash and  unused committed bank credit facilities providing total committed liquidity of  at year end  compared to  at the end of during the year  we repurchased  shares of our stock for  our board of directors raised the dividend in fiscal year by to per share

this compares to an accrual of  in the accrual reduced basic and diluted income available to common stockholders by and per share in and  respectively 
we acquired the remaining huarun redeemable stock in the fourth quarter of  refer to note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the table below presents adjusted net income per common share diluted  which excludes a non cash accrual relating to huarun redeemable stock 
the table also presents restructuring charges and a gain on the sale of a non strategic specialty product line included in net income in the respective periods 

table of contents net income per common share diluted huarun redeemable stock accrual adjusted net income per common share diluted restructuring charges gain on sale of a non strategic specialty product line adjusted net income per common share diluted is a non gaap financial measure 
management discloses this measure because we believe the measure may assist investors in comparing our results of operations in the respective periods without regard to the effect on results in the and periods of the non cash accrual related to the huarun redeemable stock 
as the huarun redeemable stock was redeemed  acquisition accounting was applied 
in addition  fiscal year and included after tax restructuring charges of and per share  respectively 
fiscal year included an after tax benefit of per share for a gain on the sale of a non strategic specialty product line

the decline of  in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower sales levels 
the inventory and other current assets decrease of  was primarily due to proactive inventory management in response to lower sales levels 
the  decrease in other deferred liabilities was primarily driven by the pension contributions see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the  decrease in income taxes payable was due to timing of payments

these include payments under our multi currency credit facilities  senior notes  industrial development bonds  employee benefit plans  non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year  commodity purchase commitments and telecommunication commitments 
interest charges are variable and assumed at current rates 
the following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of october  for the fiscal years ending in october contractual cash obligations dollars in thousands and thereafter total notes interest to banks senior notes interest industrial development bonds interest medical retiree serp pension operating leases commodity purchase commitments telecommunication commitments total contractual cash obligations we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to uncertain tax positions 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  gross unrecognized tax benefits of  as of october   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  we issued  of unsecured  senior notes that mature on june  with a coupon rate of 
the public offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the us securities and exchange commission 
we used the net proceeds of  to repay our commercial paper borrowings and a portion of our borrowings under our existing bank credit facilities 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a  unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks expiring on june  the new credit facility replaced our  day credit agreement that was due to mature in november and our  five year credit agreement that was due to mature in october  which were both terminated on june  during the fourth quarter of  the new credit facility was expanded by  to a total facility size of  the credit facility is a backstop to our  us commercial paper program established in we had notes to banks under this new facility totaling  at october  in connection with the new credit facility  we entered into a bi lateral us dollar equivalent  unsecured committed revolving credit facility  under which we had notes to banks totaling  at october   the new credit facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of october  at october   we had unused lines of committed and uncommitted credit available from banks of  
table of contents we believe cash flow from operations  existing lines of credit  access to credit facilities and access to debt and capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current and projected needs for financing 
in the current market conditions  despite the prevailing credit crisis  we have demonstrated continued access to these markets 
we have committed liquidity and cash reserves in excess of our anticipated funding requirements 
our cash and cash equivalent balances consist of high quality short term money market instruments and cash held by our international subsidiaries that are used to fund day to day operating needs 
those balances have also been used to finance acquisitions 
our investment policy on excess cash is to preserve principal 
we use derivative instruments with a number of counterparties principally to manage well defined interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks 
we evaluate the financial stability of each counterparty and spread the risk among many financial institutions to limit our exposure 
we will continue to monitor counterparty risk on an ongoing basis 
common stock dividends of  in represented a increase over the dividend in was increased to per share from per share in we have continuing authorization to purchase shares of our common stock at management s discretion for general corporate purposes 
shares repurchased in were  shares totaling  shares repurchased in were  shares totaling  we repurchased  shares totaling  in we retired  of those shares in we are involved in various claims relating to environmental and waste disposal matters at a number of current and former plant sites 
we engage or participate in remedial and other environmental compliance activities at certain of these sites 
at other sites  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal and state environmental laws for the remediation of hazardous waste 
management analyzes each individual site  considering the number of parties involved  the level of potential liability or contribution by us relative to the other parties  the nature and magnitude of the wastes involved  the method and extent of remediation  the potential insurance coverage  the estimated legal and consulting expense with respect to each site  and the time period over which any costs would likely be incurred 
based on the above analysis  management estimates the remediation or other clean up costs and related claims for each site 
the estimates are based in part on discussions with other prps  governmental agencies and engineering firms 
we accrue appropriate reserves for potential environmental liabilities  which are continually reviewed and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
while uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of our ultimate environmental liabilities  management believes there is not a reasonable possibility that such liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are involved in a variety of legal claims and proceedings relating to personal injury  product liability  warranties  customer contracts  employment  trade practices  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these claims and proceedings include cases where we are one of a number of defendants in proceedings alleging that the plaintiffs suffered injuries or contracted diseases from exposure to chemicals or other ingredients used in the production of some of our products or waste disposal 
we believe these claims and proceedings are not out of the ordinary course for a business of the type and size in which we are engaged 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and proceedings  management believes there is not a reasonable possibility that the costs and liabilities of such matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and that the judgments and estimates are reasonable 
table of contents revenue recognition other than extended furniture protection plans  revenue from sales is recognized at the time of product delivery  passage of title  a sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in revenue as the products are sold 
we sell extended furniture protection plans for which revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract 
an actuarial study utilizing historical claims data is used to forecast claim payments over the contract period  and revenue is recognized based on the forecasted claims payments 
actual claims costs are reflected in earnings in the period incurred 
anticipated losses on programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
supplier and customer rebates we record supplier and customer rebates as a reduction of cost of goods sold or a reduction to revenue  respectively  as they are earned  in accordance with the underlying agreement 
the customer rebate estimate is developed based on historical experience plus current activity for the customer s purchases 
customer rebates that increase based on different levels of sales volume are recognized immediately when the current activity plus expected volume triggers a higher earned rebate 
the supplier rebate estimate is developed based on contractual terms of our current purchasing activity 
supplier rebates that increase based on different levels of purchases are recognized when there is certainty that the current level of purchases will trigger a higher rebate earned 
valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other intangible assets consist of customer lists and relationships  purchased technology and patents and trademarks 
goodwill for our five reporting units is reviewed for impairment at least annually using a two step process see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit  as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations  to its book carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  the implied fair value is compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the implied fair value is calculated by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step to all of its assets and liabilities including unrecognized intangible assets and any excess in fair value that is not assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
management also reviews other intangible assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
if the carrying value of the finite lived intangible assets exceeds the discounted cash flows resulting from the use and disposition of the asset  the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of the assets and comparing with their carrying value 
in assessing fair value  management generally utilizes a relief from royalty method 
during the fourth quarters of and  management completed the annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews with no impairments to the carrying values identified 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted sales growth rates and our cost of capital or discount rate  are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
additionally  in assessing goodwill impairment we considered the implied control premium and concluded it was reasonable based on other recent market transactions 
changes in these estimates or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
the discount rate and sales growth assumptions are the two material assumptions utilized in our calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test and in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we utilize a cash flow approach in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  where the discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital rate 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate and sales growth assumptions used 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets have historically exceeded the carrying value of such reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets by a substantial amount 
we perform a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and revenue growth assumptions 
either the discount rate could increase by of the discount rate utilized or the sales growth assumption could decline to a zero growth environment and our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets would continue to have fair value in excess of carrying value 
we do not have any reporting units that are at risk of failing step of our goodwill impairment test 
also  we do not have any indefinite lived intangible assets at risk of failing our impairment test 
there have been no significant events since the timing of our impairment tests that would have triggered additional impairment testing 

table of contents the assumptions used in our impairment testing could be adversely affected by certain of the risks discussed in risk factors in item a of this report 
for additional information about goodwill  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and post retirement medical obligations we sponsor several defined benefit plans for certain hourly and salaried employees 
we sponsor post retirement medical benefits for certain us employees 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans in accordance with gaap  which requires the amount recognized in financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical trend rates and discount rates 
a change in these assumptions could cause actual results to differ from those reported 
a reduction of basis points in the long term rate of return and a reduction of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense  in a increase in the medical trend rates would not have a material effect on post retirement medical expense or the post retirement benefit obligation 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements  for further details regarding accounting for pensions and post retirement medical benefits 
income taxes at each period end  it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in the foreign jurisdictions and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the united states  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of uncertain tax positions 
our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company

forward looking statements are necessarily subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are outside our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements 
any statement that is not historical in nature is a forward looking statement and may be identified by the use of words and phrases such as expects  anticipates  believes  will  will likely result  will continue  plans to and similar expressions 
these uncertainties and other factors include  but are not limited to  changes in general economic conditions both domestic and international  including recessions and other external economic and political factors  which may adversely affect our business  the value of our investments  the financial stability of our customers and suppliers and our ability to obtain financing  dependence of internal earnings growth on economic conditions and growth in the domestic and international coatings industry  competitive factors including pricing pressure and product competition  risks related to any future acquisitions  including risks of adverse changes in the results of acquired businesses and the assumption of unforeseen liabilities  risks of disruptions in business resulting from the integration process and higher interest costs resulting from further borrowing for any such acquisitions  our reliance on the efforts of vendors  government agencies  utilities and other third parties to achieve adequate compliance and avoid disruption of our business  risks of disruptions in business resulting from our relationships with customers and suppliers  risks and uncertainties associated with operations and achievement of growth in developing markets  including china and central and south america  unusual weather conditions adversely affecting sales  changes in raw materials pricing and availability  delays in passing along cost increases to customers  changes in governmental regulation  including more stringent environmental  health and safety regulations  changes in accounting policies and standards and taxation requirements such as new tax laws or revised tax law interpretations  the nature  cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings  civil unrest and the outbreak of war and other significant national and international events  and other risks and uncertainties
