this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments as of december  recent developments on july   we completed the sale of a interest in substantially all of the businesses in our insurance services segment fiserv insurance to trident iv  lp 
we recognized an after tax loss of per share from the sale 
this loss on sale was comprised of a pre tax loss of million and an income tax provision of million per share which was incurred on sale due to a significantly lower tax basis in the stock compared to the book basis of the net assets sold 
upon closing  we received cash proceeds of approximately million and a million note due in our remaining ownership interest in fiserv insurance is accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby our investment was established based on our historical basis  is adjusted for our share of undistributed net income or net loss  and is reported within other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
beginning on july   we no longer consolidate revenues and expenses of fiserv insurance and report our share of net income as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income 
on february   we completed the first of two transactions to dispose of our investment support services segment fiserv iss by selling fiserv trust company and the accounts of our institutional retirement plan and advisor services operations to td ameritrade online holdings  inc for approximately million  net of income taxes and transaction costs 
in the second transaction  robert beriault holdings  inc has agreed to acquire the remaining accounts and net capital of fiserv iss  including the investment administration services business which provides back office and custody services for individual retirement accounts 
this portion of the fiserv iss disposition remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval by the fdic 
on january   we completed the sale of a majority of our health businesses fiserv health to unitedhealthcare services  inc for approximately million  net of income taxes and transaction costs 
the financial results of fiserv health and fiserv iss are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies general our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 
valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets  such as intangible assets  can be complex and require a significant amount of judgment 
we use the information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists  when necessary  to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long lived assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our definite lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires us to perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
first  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit s net assets  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and any impairment charge 
additionally  we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the underlying carrying value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of determined that the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not impaired 
given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances  an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge  which could be material to our financial statements 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction based fees 
revenue is recognized when the related services have been rendered 
revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long term in nature  generally three to five years  and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions 
given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition  our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations 
additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet variable interest entities or other off balance sheet financing  other than operating leases 
we use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates  managing our ratio of fixed to floating rate long term debt and foreign exchange rate risks 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the anticipated adoption dates  which is incorporated herein by reference 
non gaap financial measure in this report  we refer to internal revenue growth percentage  which is a non gaap financial measure 
we use internal revenue growth percentage to monitor and evaluate our performance  and it is presented in this report because we believe that it allows shareholders to understand the portion of our revenue growth that is attributed to acquired companies as compared to internal revenue growth 
this non gaap financial measure should not be considered to be a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 
the method that we use to calculate internal revenue growth percentage is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
internal revenue growth percentage is measured as the increase or decrease in total revenues for the current period less acquired revenue from acquisitions divided by total revenues from the prior period plus acquired revenue from acquisitions 
acquired revenue from acquisitions represents pre acquisition revenue of acquired companies for the prior period 
internal revenue growth percentage is calculated as follows years ended december  in millions financial segment total revenues acquired revenue from acquisitions total internal revenue growth decline internal revenue growth percentage payments segment total revenues acquired revenue from acquisitions total internal revenue growth internal revenue growth percentage results of operations business segments we acquired checkfree corporation checkfree on december  in connection with the integration of checkfree and the significant expansion of our payments related businesses  along with associated organizational changes  we reclassified our reporting segments for all periods presented to align them with how our chief operating decision maker currently manages the business 
as a result  effective january   our operations consist of the following business segments financial institution services financial  payments and industry products payments  insurance services insurance and corporate and other 
the financial segment provides banks  thrifts and credit unions with account processing services  item processing services  loan origination and servicing products  cash management and consulting services  and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions 
the payments segment provides products and services that address a range of technology needs for the financial services industry  including internet banking  electronic bill payment  electronic funds transfer and debit processing  fraud and risk management capabilities  card and print personalization services  check imaging  and investment account processing services for separately managed accounts 
in  we completed the sale of a interest in substantially all of the businesses in the insurance segment 
the corporate and other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations 
components of revenues and expenses the following summary describes the components of revenues and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income 
a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
processing and services processing and services revenues  which in represented of our consolidated revenues  are primarily generated from account and transaction based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years 
revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been rendered 
processing and services revenues are most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services 
cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following personnel  equipment and data communication  infrastructure costs  including costs to maintain applications  client support  depreciation and amortization  and other operating expenses 
product product revenues  which in represented of our consolidated revenues  are primarily derived from integrated print and card production  prescription product and software licenses 
prior to our sale of a interest in fiserv insurance on july   prescription product revenues were recognized on a gross basis to include the prescription price 
cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following costs of materials and prescription products  personnel  infrastructure costs  depreciation and amortization  and other costs directly associated with product revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries  wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel  administrative employees and management  advertising and promotional costs  depreciation and amortization  and other selling and administrative expenses

interest income in was primarily earned by investing the proceeds from our business dispositions 
interest income in was primarily earned by investing the proceeds from the senior notes borrowings during the period from our receipt of the proceeds until we completed the acquisition of checkfree 
loss on sale of businesses in  we recognized a million pre tax loss which was primarily due to our sale of a interest in fiserv insurance 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was in  in and in the higher effective income tax rate in was primarily due to a million income tax provision related to our sale of a interest in fiserv insurance which was due to a significantly lower tax basis in the stock compared to the book basis of the net assets sold 
the tax provision related to sale of businesses increased the effective income tax rate in by percentage points  from to 
we expect that our income tax rate for continuing operations will be approximately in income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate due to our sale of a interest in fiserv insurance in july  we record our share of fiserv insurance s net income  million in  as income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate 
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in income from discontinued operations in compared to was primarily due to after tax gains of million related to the sales of a portion of fiserv iss and all of fiserv health

we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations  our cash and cash equivalents at december  of million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million 
years ended december  increase decrease in millions income from continuing operations depreciation and amortization share based compensation loss on sale of businesses income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate settlement of interest rate hedge contracts net changes in working capital and other operating cash flow our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  or operating cash flow  increased million  or  to million in from million in this significant increase was primarily due to strong operating cash flow associated with our acquisition of checkfree and overall improvements in working capital of million 
depreciation and amortization increased million in primarily due to a million increase in intangible amortization associated with acquisitions 
our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and fund capital expenditures  rather than to pay dividends 
our capital expenditures increased million to million in compared to million in  due primarily to capital expenditures associated with checkfree 
our capital expenditures were less than of total revenues in share repurchases we purchased million  million and million of our common stock in  and  respectively 
on july   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans 
as of december   we had million shares remaining under our authorization 
indebtedness december  in millions long term debt including current maturities in  we used our operating cash flow and the proceeds from business dispositions primarily to repay billion of debt  which reduced our outstanding debt including current maturities to billion at december  our long term debt currently consists primarily of billion under our unsecured senior term loan facility  billion under senior notes borrowings  and million under our million revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants in revolving credit facility we maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate 
there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under this facility 
the revolving credit facility  as amended  contains various restrictions and covenants that require us  among other things  to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than a specified multiple ranging between and of consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments  and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense 
the facility expires on march  the weighted average variable interest rate on revolving credit facility borrowings was at december  at december   our outstanding borrowings on this facility were million and available borrowings were million 
senior term loan in december  we borrowed billion under an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks 
this term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate and matures in november a scheduled principal payment of million is due in december  payments of million are due in december and  and the remaining principal of billion is due in november the weighted average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was at december  the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above 
senior notes in november  we issued billion of senior notes due in november and million of senior notes due in november  which pay interest at the stated rate on may and november of each year 
the interest rates applicable to these notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that  among other matters  limit our ability to consolidate or merge into  or convey  transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to  another person  our ability to create or assume liens  and our ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions 
interest rate hedge contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  we maintain a series of interest rate swap agreements swaps with total notional values of billion at december  the swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted average rate of approximately prior to financing spreads and related fees 
the swaps have expiration dates through september shelf registration statement in  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  we may sell common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  or a combination thereof 
each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering 
we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers  through agents  directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay indebtedness or for working capital  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
other access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital  our ability to refinance maturing indebtedness and our ability to fund future acquisitions 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on various factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our debt securities  perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had a credit rating of baa with a stable outlook from moody s investors service  inc moody s and bbb with a negative outlook from standard poor s ratings services s p on our senior unsecured debt securities 
the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody s or s p downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes 
if the ratings from moody s or s p decrease below investment grade  the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 
in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed above the original interest rate 
the interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated a or its equivalent or higher by moody s and a or its equivalent or higher by s p  in each case with a stable or positive outlook 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
the interest component of long term debt obligations and minimum operating lease payments are reported on a pre tax basis 
the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december  in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt including interest minimum operating lease payments purchase obligations income tax obligations total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  currency exchange rates  indices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on investments and borrowings and foreign currency risk 
we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
in connection with processing electronic payments transactions  the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants 
these subscriber funds are generally invested in short term instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government 
subscriber funds  which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets  can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity  and totaled approximately billion as of december  based upon interest rates and subscriber funds balances at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual income from continuing operations by approximately million 
fiserv iss  which is included in discontinued operations  is a custodian of self directed individual retirement accounts 
it accepts retirement account deposits from clients and invests the funds in securities  substantially all of which are rated within the highest investment grade categories for securities 
fiserv iss utilizes simulation models for measuring and monitoring interest rate risk and market value of portfolio equities 
a formal asset liability committee meets quarterly to review interest rate risks  capital ratios  liquidity levels  portfolio diversification  credit risk ratings and adherence to investment policies and guidelines 
we do not believe significant changes in interest rates would have a material impact on our operating results from discontinued operations or our financial condition 
we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts 
we currently use interest rate swaps to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs 
generally  under these swaps  we agree with a counter party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount 
based on our long term debt with variable interest rates as of december   a increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in by approximately million 
we believe the risks associated with financial instruments at december  will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we conduct business in the us and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non us denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates were higher or lower at december   there would not have been a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position
