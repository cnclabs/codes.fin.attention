table of contents overview we are a specialized commercial finance company that provides microticket equipment leasing and other financing services 
the average amount financed by timepayment during was approximately  while leasecomm historically financed contracts averaging approximately  our portfolio consists of point of sale pos authorization systems and other small business equipment leased or rented to small commercial enterprises 
we derive the majority of our revenues from leases originated and held by us  payments on service contracts  rental contracts and fee income 
historically  we funded the majority of our leases and contracts through our revolving credit loans  term loans and on balance sheet securitizations  and to a lesser extent our subordinated debt program and internally generated funds 
between october and june  an interruption in our financing sources had a significant impact on our ability to originate contracts 
as of september   our then existing credit facility failed to renew and we began paying down the debt  suspending virtually all new contract originations in october until new financing could be obtained or until the credit facility could be paid in full 
in april  we entered into a long term agreement with our lenders which waived certain covenant defaults and required us to repay the credit facility over a month term 
in june  we secured a one year million line of credit and a million three year subordinated note that allowed us to resume microticket contract originations 
in conjunction with raising new capital  we also established a new wholly owned operating subsidiary  timepayment corp 
in september  we secured a three year  million  senior secured revolving line of credit from cit 
the cit line of credit replaced the million line of credit obtained in june under more favorable terms and conditions 
in addition  we used the proceeds from the cit line of credit to retire the existing debt with the former bank group 
during the year ended december   we began to actively increase our industry presence with a more focused and targeted sales and marketing effort 
we continue to invest capital to build an infrastructure to support our sales and marketing initiatives  and have brought in experienced sales and marketing management to spearhead the effort 
on july   by mutual agreement between cit and us  we paid off and terminated the cit line of credit without penalty 
on august   we entered into a new three year million line of credit with sovereign bank based on qualified timepayment lease receivables 
on july  we entered into an amended agreement to increase our line of credit with sovereign from million to million 
the maturity date of the amended agreement is august  outstanding borrowings are collateralized by eligible lease contracts and a security interest in all of our other assets and  until february  bore interest at prime or at libor plus 
under the terms of the facility  loans are prime rate loans  unless we elect libor loans 
if a libor loan is not renewed at maturity it automatically coverts to a prime rate loan 
on february  we entered into an amended agreement to increase our line of credit with sovereign to million 
under the amended agreement  outstanding borrowings bear interest at either prime plus or libor plus  in each case subject to a minimum interest rate of 
all other terms of the facility remained the same 
in a typical lease transaction  we originate a lease through our nationwide network of equipment vendors  independent sales organizations and brokers 
upon our approval of a lease application and verification that the lessee has received the equipment and signed the lease  we pay the dealer for the cost of the equipment  plus the dealer s profit margin 
in the past  we have also from time to time acquired service contracts under which a homeowner purchases a security system and simultaneously signs a contract with the dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
upon approval of the monitoring application and verification with the homeowner that the system is installed  we would purchase the right to the payment stream under the monitoring contract from the dealer at a negotiated multiple of the monthly payments 
we have not purchased any new security monitoring contracts since  although we do originate security equipment leases that include monitoring 
our service contract portfolio represents a less significant portion of our revenue stream over time 
substantially all leases originated or acquired by us are non cancelable 
during the term of the lease  we are scheduled to receive payments sufficient to cover our borrowing costs  the cost of the underlying equipment and 
table of contents provide us with an appropriate profit 
we pass along some of the costs of our leases and contracts by charging collection fees  loss and damage waiver fees  late fees and other service fees  when applicable 
the initial non cancelable term of the lease is equal to or less than the equipment s estimated economic life and often provides us with additional revenues based on the residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease 
initial terms of the leases in our portfolio generally range from to months  with an average initial term of months as of december  critical accounting policies we consider certain of our accounting policies to be the most critical to our financial condition and results of operations in the sense that they involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we have identified our most critical accounting policies as those policies related to revenue recognition  the allowance for credit losses  income taxes and accounting for share based compensation 
these accounting policies are discussed below as well as within the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  we record the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
amortization of unearned lease income and initial direct costs is suspended if  in our opinion  full payment of the contractual amount due under the lease agreement is doubtful 
in conjunction with the origination of leases  we may retain a residual interest in the underlying equipment upon termination of the lease 
the value of such interest is estimated at inception of the lease and evaluated periodically for impairment 
at the end of the lease term  the lessee has the option to buy the equipment at the fair market value  return the equipment or continue to rent the equipment on a month to month basis 
if the lessee continues to rent the equipment  we record our investment in the rental contract at its estimated residual value 
rental revenue and depreciation are recognized based on the methodology described below 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees and service fees relating to the leases and contracts are recognized as they are earned 
our investments in cancelable service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the contract 
income on service contracts from monthly billings is recognized as the related services are provided 
our investment in rental contracts is either recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months or at the acquisition cost and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months 
rental income from monthly billings is recognized as the customer continues to rent the equipment 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of our investments in service and rental contracts 
allowance for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses on our investment in leases  service contracts and rental contracts at an amount that we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our portfolio 
given the nature of the microticket market and the individual size of each transaction  we do not have a formal credit review committee to review individual transactions 
rather  we developed a sophisticated  risk adjusted pricing model and have automated the credit scoring  approval and collection processes 
we believe that with the proper risk adjusted pricing model  we can grant credit to a wide range of applicants provided we have priced appropriately for the associated risk 
as a result of approving a wide range of credits  we experience a relatively high level of delinquency and write offs in our portfolio 
we periodically review the credit scoring and approval process to ensure that the automated system is making appropriate credit decisions 
given the nature of the microticket market and the individual size of each transaction  we do not evaluate transactions individually for the purpose of developing and determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
contracts in our portfolio are not re graded subsequent to the initial extension of credit and the allowance is not allocated to specific contracts 
rather  we view the contracts as having common characteristics and maintain a general allowance against our entire portfolio utilizing historical collection statistics and an assessment of current credit risk in the portfolio as the basis for the amount 

table of contents we have adopted a consistent  systematic procedure for establishing and maintaining an appropriate allowance for credit losses for our microticket transactions 
we estimate the likelihood of credit losses net of recoveries in the portfolio at each reporting period based upon a combination of the lessee s bureau reported credit score at lease inception and the current delinquency status of the account 
in addition to these elements  we also consider other relevant factors including general economic trends  trends in delinquencies and credit losses  static pool analysis of our portfolio  trends in recoveries made on charged off accounts  and other relevant factors which might affect the performance of our portfolio 
this combination of historical experience  credit scores  delinquency levels  trends in credit losses  and the review of current factors provide the basis for our analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
we take charge offs against our receivables when such receivables are deemed uncollectible 
in general a receivable is uncollectable when it is days past due where no contact has been made with the lessee for months or  if earlier  when other adverse events occur with respect to an account 
historically  the typical monthly payment under our microticket leases has been small and as a result  our experience is that lessees will pay past due amounts later in the process because of the small amount necessary to bring an account current 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as leases  for tax and accounting purposes 
in addition  our income tax calculations involve the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
differences between the basis of assets and liabilities result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and to the extent management believes recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is unnecessary 
share based compensation as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas r share based payments  which requires the measurement of compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards at fair value and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r securities and exchange commission  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
share based payments 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the expected option term  volatility of our stock  the risk free interest rate and our dividend yield 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us under sfas r 
results of operations revenues change change in thousands income on financing leases rental income income on service contracts loss and damage waiver fees service fees and other interest income total revenues 
table of contents our lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  we record the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases and contracts  and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from the year ended december  revenue from leases was million  up million from the previous year as a result of the increased originations 
rental income was million  down million from other revenue components contributed million  up million from the previous year  despite a decline in interest income of  during the year 
the decrease in interest income is a result of the decrease in cash and cash equivalents on hand as well as lower rates of investment 
the decline in rental income is primarily explained by attrition rates in the two sources of rental income 
one source is rental agreements that are originated and cancellable on a monthly basis 
the other is the rental income that is recognized at the end of the lease term when a lessee chooses to keep the equipment and rents it on a monthly basis 
since we resumed funding in following an interruption in our funding sources  we have not originated any new rental contracts and few lease contracts have been eligible to convert to rental agreements since they have not reached the end of term 
we have not funded any new service contracts since we resumed funding in  therefore this segment of revenue continues to decline 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of  or from the year ended december  revenue from leases was million  up million from the previous year and rental income was million  down million from other revenue components contributed million  down million from the previous year 
the decline in service contract revenue accounted for  of the million decrease in other revenue while decreases in service fees and interest income accounted for  and  of the decline respectively 
the decline in rental income is primarily explained by attrition rates in the two sources of rental income described above 
in addition  the decline in income from service contracts is consistent with the lack of any new service contract originations since we resumed funding in selling  general and administrative change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative as a percent of revenue our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include costs of maintaining corporate functions such as accounting  finance  collections  legal  human resources  sales and underwriting  and information systems

the expense reductions resulted from the decrease in the overall volume of our portfolio  an improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio  the settlement of outstanding litigation and our cost control efforts 

table of contents provision for credit losses change change dollars in thousands provision for credit losses as a percent of revenue we maintain an allowance for credit losses on our investment in leases  service contracts and rental contracts at an amount that we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our portfolio 
our provision for credit losses increased million or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net charge offs increased million to million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the provision was based on providing a general allowance against leases funded during the year and our analysis of actual and expected losses in our portfolio as a whole 
the increase in the allowance reflects the growth in lease receivables associated with new lease originations  increased delinquency levels  and the current economic climate 
our provision for credit loss increased  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net charge offs decreased million to million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the provision was based on providing a general allowance against leases funded during the year and our analysis of actual and expected losses in our portfolio as a whole 
depreciation and amortization change change dollars in thousands depreciation fixed assets depreciation rental equipment amortization service contracts total depreciation and amortization as a percent of revenue depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation on fixed assets and rental equipment  and the amortization of service contracts 
fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over their expected useful lives 
certain rental contracts are originated as a result of the renewal provisions of our lease agreements where at the end of the lease term  the customer may elect to continue to rent the leased equipment on a month to month basis 
the rental equipment is recorded at its residual value and depreciated over a term of months 
this term represents the estimated life of a previously leased piece of equipment and is based upon our historical experience 
in the event the contract terminates prior to the end of the month period  the remaining net book value is expensed 
we have in the past offered a rental agreement  which allowed the customer  assuming the contract was current and no event of default existed  to terminate the contract at any time by returning the equipment and providing us with days notice 
these assets were recorded at cost and depreciated over an estimated life of months 
this term was based upon our historical experience 
in the event that the contract terminated prior to the end of the month period  the remaining net book value was expensed 
we have not originated any new rental contracts since service contracts were recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated life of months 
in a typical service contract acquisition  a homeowner will purchase a home security system and simultaneously sign a contract with the security dealer for monthly monitoring of the system 
the security dealer would then sell the rights to that monthly payment to us 
we perform all of the processing  billing  collection and administrative work on the service contract 
the estimated life is based upon the expected life of such contracts in the security monitoring industry and our historical experience 
in the event the contract terminates prior to the end of the month term  the remaining net book value is expensed 
we have not originated any new service contracts since

interest expense increased by  or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the increased borrowings on our line of credit 
at december   we had notes payable of million compared to notes payable of million at december  interest expense decreased by  or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the reduction in the interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount related to the warrants we issued to cit in connection with our line of credit 
at december   we had notes payable of million compared to notes payable of  at december  provision for income taxes change change in thousands provision for income taxes as a percent of revenue the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any necessary valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets  involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as leases  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recorded on the balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and to the extent we believe recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is unnecessary 
the provision for income taxes decreased by  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the  decrease in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes increased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the million increase in income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in the rate is that we recognized a decrease in the effective tax rate due to the settlement of an irs audit 
our through tax years were audited by the internal revenue service 
as part of the audit  the internal revenue service agent had proposed several adjustments to our federal income tax returns that would have 
table of contents required us to pay the irs an amount between and million 
such payments would have been offset by an adjustment to our deferred tax asset as the amount would likely have been recoverable in future periods 
we filed a formal protest under the appeals process challenging these adjustments and reached a final settlement in december which required us to pay  in additional taxes and  in interest 
other operating data dealer fundings were million during the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to the year ended december  this increase is a result of our continuing effort to increase originations through business development efforts that include increasing the size of our vendor base and sourcing a larger number of applications from those vendors

table of contents exposure to credit losses the amounts in the table below represent the balance of delinquent receivables on an exposure basis for all leases  rental contracts and service contracts in our portfolio as of december   and an exposure basis aging classifies the entire receivable based on the invoice that is the most delinquent 
for example  in the case of a rental or service contract  if a receivable is days past due  all amounts billed and unpaid are placed in the over days past due category 
in the case of lease receivables  where the minimum contractual obligation of the lessee is booked as a receivable at the inception of the lease  if a receivable is days past due  the entire receivable  including all amounts billed and unpaid as well as the minimum contractual obligation yet to be billed  will be placed in the over days past due category 
december  december  december  dollars in thousands current days past due days past due over days past due receivables due in installments liquidity and capital resources general our lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund lease originations 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through borrowings under our credit facilities  on balance sheet securitizations  the issuance of subordinated debt  free cash flow and the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in february we will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand our funding of leases and contracts  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
in the near term  we expect to finance our business utilizing the cash on hand and our line of credit which matures in august additionally  our uses of cash include the payment of interest and principal on borrowings  selling  general and administrative expenses  income taxes  payment of dividends  and capital expenditures 
we generated cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  investing activities primarily relate to the origination of leases with investments in lease contracts  direct costs  property  and equipment

we repaid million during  million during  and million during in addition  we paid dividends of million in  million in and million in we believe that cash flows from our existing portfolio  cash on hand  available borrowings on the existing credit facility  and additional financing as required will be sufficient to support our operations and lease origination activity in the near term 

table of contents borrowings we utilize our line of credit to fund the origination and acquisition of leases 
borrowings outstanding under our lines of credit consist of the following december  december  maximum maximum amounts interest unused facility amounts interest unused facility outstanding rate capacity amount outstanding rate capacity amount dollars in revolving credit facility the unused capacity is subject to limitations based on lease eligibility and the borrowing base formula 
on august   we entered into a new three year million line of credit with sovereign based on qualified lease receivables 
on july  we entered into an amended agreement to increase our line of credit with sovereign to million 
the maturity date of the amended agreement is august  outstanding borrowings are collateralized by eligible lease contracts and a security interest in all of our other assets and  until february  bore interest at prime or the day london interbank offered rate libor plus 
at december  all of our loans were prime rate loans 
the prime at december  was 
as of december  the qualified lease receivables eligible under the borrowing base exceeded the million line of credit 
the line of credit has financial covenants that we must comply with to obtain funding and avoid an event of default 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the line of credit 
on february  we entered into an amended agreement to increase our line of credit with sovereign to million 
under the amended agreement  outstanding borrowings bear interest at prime plus or libor plus  subject in each case to a minimum interest rate of 
all other terms of the facility remained the same 
prior to entering into the sovereign facility  we had a three year senior secured revolving line of credit with cit where we could borrow a maximum of million based upon qualified lease receivables 
outstanding borrowings bore interest at prime plus for prime rate loans or at libor plus for libor loans 
as of december   based on lease eligibility and the borrowing base formula  we had million in excess availability on the cit line of credit 
on july   by mutual agreement between cit and us  we paid off and terminated the cit line of credit without penalty  and cit released its security interests and liens 
prior to obtaining the million cit line of credit in september  we had borrowings outstanding under a million senior credit facility with a group of financial institutions  which failed to renew in september while cash flows from our portfolio were sufficient to repay borrowings under the million senior credit facility  we were forced to suspend virtually all contract originations until a new source of liquidity was obtained 
as of december   the loan under the million senior credit facility had been fully repaid 
we have periodically in the past financed our lease and service contracts through securitizations using special purpose entities 
when we use this financing alternative  the assets of these special purpose entities were not available to pay our other creditors 
however  the special purpose entities were included in our consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result  such assets and the related liabilities remain on our balance sheet and do not receive gain on sale treatment 
the amounts borrowed under our securitization agreements were fully repaid as of december  and the special purpose entities associated with these agreements were subsequently dissolved 
financial covenants our sovereign line of credit  like our prior facilities  has financial covenants that must be complied with in order to obtain funding through the facility and to avoid an event of default 
these include requirements that we i maintain a ratio of our consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes and non recurring non cash items  as calculated under the agreement  to our consolidated interest expense of not less than as of the end of any fiscal quarter  ii maintain consolidated tangible capital base defined to mean our consolidated tangible net worth  as calculated under the agreement  plus subordinated debt at minimum levels  which are increased from quarter to 
table of contents quarter in relation to our net income and any equity capital we receive  iii maintain a leverage ratio defined to mean the ratio of consolidated total liabilities  less subordinated debt  to consolidated tangible net worth  plus subordinated debt of during fiscal and during  and iv not permit the amount of receivables over days past due to exceed of gross lease installments 
the line of credit also contains other affirmative and negative covenants  including a restriction on our ability to incur or guaranty indebtedness  dispose of or acquire assets or engage in a merger transaction  or make certain restricted payments 
as of december   we believe that we were in compliance with all covenants in our borrowing relationships 
contractual obligations and lease commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due payments payments payments less than due due due after contractual obligations total year years years years revolving line of credit operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total contractual obligations we have entered into various agreements  such as debt and operating lease agreements that require future payments 
during the year ended december  we had net borrowings of million against our line of credit 
the million of outstanding borrowings as of december  will be repaid by the daily application of timepayment receipts to our outstanding balance 
our future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are  annually for the years through our future minimum lease payments under capital leases are   and  for the years ended december   and respectively 
lease commitments we accept lease applications on daily basis and have a pipeline of applications that have been approved  where a lease has not been originated 
our commitment to lend does not become binding until all of the steps in the lease origination process have been completed  including but not limited to the receipt of a complete and accurate lease document  all required supporting information and successful verification with the lessee 
since we fund on the same day a lease is successfully verified  we have no firm outstanding commitments to lend 
market risk and financial instruments the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of operations  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include credit risk and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
the implicit yield on all of our leases and contracts is on a fixed interest rate basis due to the leases and contracts having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination 
when we originate or acquire leases or contracts  we base our pricing in part on the spread we expect to achieve between the implicit yield on each lease or contract and the effective interest rate we expect to incur in financing such lease or contract through our credit facility 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease or contract could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
given the relatively short average life of our leases and contracts  our goal is to maintain a blend of fixed and variable interest rate obligations which limits our interest rate risk 
as of december   we have repaid all of 
table of contents our fixed rate debt and have million of outstanding variable interest rate obligations under our sovereign line of credit 
our sovereign line of credit bears interest at rates which fluctuate with changes in the prime or the libor  therefore  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
the effect of a adverse change in market interest rates  sustained for one year  on our interest expense would be immaterial 
we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy guidelines 
the primary objectives of the investment guidelines are to preserve capital  maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs  and to maximize return 
we minimize investment risk by limiting the amount invested in any single security and by focusing on conservative investment choices with short terms and high credit quality standards 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or invest for speculative trading purposes 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements

table of contents in a convertible debt instrument no longer meets the bifurcation criteria in statement at initial application of this issue  the carrying amount of the liability for the conversion option that is  its fair value on the date of adoption shall be reclassified to shareholders equity 
any debt discount that was recognized when the conversion option was initially bifurcated from the convertible debt instrument shall continue to be amortized 
earlier application by an entity that has previously adopted an alternative accounting policy is not permitted 
we believe adoption of this eitf will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
