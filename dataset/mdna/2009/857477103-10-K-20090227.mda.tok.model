in consideration of the terms of the offer and the context in which it was issued  we revised our projection of the timing and amount of tax cash flows from the leases and recalculated the recognition of lease related revenue over the leases terms from their inception

in february  in light of the impact of the continued disruption in the global capital markets experienced since the middle of  which is described in more detail in the following section  we announced a series of actions to strengthen our tangible common equity  or tce  ratio 
we define the tce ratio as the relationship of our consolidated common shareholders equity to our consolidated total assets  with both amounts reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes 
for  our plan to improve our tce ratio includes temporarily reducing our quarterly dividend on our common stock to per share  the reinvestment of investment securities paying down and maturing during into interest bearing deposits with us and us central banks  and a resulting reduction in the size of our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect that these actions will produce growth in organic capital but will reduce our net interest margin for by approximately to compared to impact of securities markets disruption and government actions over the past eighteen months  the global financial markets have experienced significant disruption  including substantial volatility  limited trading activity in some markets and a widespread lack of liquidity 
these events  and the potential for increased and continuing disruption  have significantly diminished overall confidence in the financial markets and in financial institutions  and have further worsened liquidity and pricing issues within the fixed income securities markets 
in the second half of  these conditions resulted in the bankruptcy or acquisition of  or significant government assistance to  a number of major domestic and international financial institutions 
overall  this disruption increased the uncertainty and unpredictability we face in our business and affected our results of operations and our financial condition 
the significant declines in equity and other financial markets globally during adversely affected our servicing and management fee revenues  which are based  in part  on the value of assets under custody or management 
our trading services revenue benefitted from market volatility and the resulting increases in the volumes of transactions that we execute for our customers 
our securities finance revenue was favorably affected by wider spreads  although this business experienced a decline in lending due to the reduction or suspension of participation by some institutional investors in our securities lending program 
during the third and fourth quarters of  in response to the above described market conditions  federal government and bank regulatory agencies  particularly the us department of the treasury  the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the fdic  working in cooperation with foreign governments and other central banks  instituted a variety of programs designed to restore confidence in the financial markets  strengthen financial institutions and encourage the flow of credit and liquidity in support of the us economy 
the programs in which state street had significant participation or involvement are described below 
asset backed commercial paper money market mutual fund liquidity facility this facility  referred to as the amlf  was instituted by the federal reserve in september it is designed to restore liquidity in the asset backed commercial paper markets and assist money market mutual funds in meeting

the program temporarily guarantees the share price of any publicly offered  eligible money market mutual fund that applies for and pays a fee to participate in the program 
the program provides coverage to shareholders up to amounts that they held in participating money market funds as of the close of business on september  the program  originally intended to expire on december   has been extended through april  three of ssga s money market funds are participating in the program 
commercial paper funding facility the facility  referred to as the cpff  was instituted by the federal reserve and became operational in october the facility is designed to complement the federal reserve s existing credit facilities to help provide liquidity to term funding markets 
it provides a liquidity back stop to us issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle that purchases three month unsecured and asset backed commercial paper directly from eligible issuers 
state street was appointed cpff custodian and administrator in october during the fourth quarter of  we paid a registration fee of approximately million to the federal reserve to participate in the facility 
the state street administered asset backed commercial paper conduits  as of december   had sold billion of commercial paper to the cpff 
the cpff  originally intended to expire on april   was extended to october  temporary liquidity guarantee program the program was announced by the fdic in october  and final rules were issued in november and december the program is designed to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the us banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts and certain holding companies  and by providing unlimited insurance protection for non interest bearing deposit transactions accounts at fdic insured institutions through december  the program provides a guarantee for unsecured senior debt issued through june  by banks  thrifts  bank holding companies  financial holding companies and thrift holding companies

additional information about the fdic s guarantee of certain of our senior unsecured debt is provided in the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis included in this form k under item 
table of contents money market investor funding facility this program  instituted by the federal reserve  became operational in november the program is designed to provide liquidity to eligible us money market investors 
the federal reserve bank of new york will provide up to billion of senior secured funding to a series of private sector special purpose vehicles to finance the purchase of eligible assets from eligible investors 
the special purpose vehicles will commence a wind down process on october  unless the federal reserve further extends the facility 
state street facilitated the implementation and extension of this program  working with the federal reserve and the program administrator 
tarp capital purchase program state street was selected by treasury as one of the nine financial institutions to participate in the launch of this program  in connection with actions taken by the us government designed to protect the us economy  strengthen public confidence in financial institutions and foster the strong functioning of credit markets

total revenue years ended december  change dollars in millions fee revenue servicing fees management fees trading services securities finance processing fees and other total fee revenue net interest revenue interest revenue interest expense net interest revenue provision for loan losses net interest revenue after provision for loan losses gains losses related to investment securities  net gain on sale of citistreet interest  net of exit and other associated costs total revenue our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue 
fee revenue generated by investment servicing and investment management is augmented by securities finance  trading services and other processing fee revenue 
we earn net interest revenue from customers deposits and short term investment activities  by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles  such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper  to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments  and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate 
fee revenue servicing and management fees collectively comprised approximately of our total fee revenue for and for these fees are a function of several factors  including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management  securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions  and the types of products and services used by customers  and are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations 
generally  servicing fees are affected  in part  by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody  while management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management 
additional factors  such as the level of transaction volumes  changes in service level  balance credits  customer minimum balances  pricing concessions and other factors  may have a significant effect on servicing fee revenue 
generally  management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue 
management fees also include performance fees  which amounted to approximately of management fees for compared to for performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements  and we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees 
in light of the above  we estimate  assuming all other factors remain constant  that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of 
table of contents approximately 
if fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by  we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately in our total revenue 
we would expect the above described relationships to exist in normalized financial markets 
these relationships were not experienced in in light of the significant disruption in the global financial markets 
those disrupted conditions adversely affected our servicing and management fee revenues for  which are based  in part  on the value of assets under custody or management as described earlier in this section 
however  during  in general  our trading services revenue benefited from volatility in the markets and from related increases in customer transaction volume  our securities finance revenue benefited from wider spreads  in spite of a decline in securities lending volumes caused by reduced or suspended participation by some institutional investors in the program  and our net interest revenue grew as a result of federal reserve rate reductions and significant increases in customer deposits 
collectively  these positive trends offset a portion of the market related impact on certain of our revenue 
in addition  the acquired investors financial business contributed a full year of revenue in compared to six months in the following table presents selected equity market indices 
daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes that affect servicing and management fee revenue  respectively 
year end indices impact the value of assets under custody and management at those dates

products and services include custody  product and participant level accounting  daily pricing and administration  recordkeeping  investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing services  master trust and master custody  and performance  risk and compliance analytics 
the growth in servicing fees from primarily resulted from the inclusion of an additional million of servicing fee revenue from the acquired investors financial business  an increase of million from the impact of net new business from existing and new customers and higher transaction volumes 
net new business is defined as new business net of lost business 
the aggregate increase in servicing fees was partially offset by declines in daily average equity market valuations and pricing concessions

we service approximately of the hedge fund market and more than billion of offshore assets  primarily domiciled in ireland  luxembourg and toronto 
we have more than billion in assets under administration in the asia pacific region  and are the largest non domestic trust bank in japan 
at year end  our total assets under custody were trillion  compared to trillion a year earlier 
the majority of the decrease compared to was the result of declines in market valuations 
the value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served 
changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue 
assets under custody consisted of the following at december assets under custody as of december  annual growth rate compound annual growth rate dollars in billions mutual funds collective funds pension products insurance and other products total financial instrument mix of assets under custody as of december  in billions equities fixed income short term and other investments total geographic mix of assets under custody as of december  in billions united states other americas europe middle east africa asia pacific total geographic mix is based on the location where the assets are serviced 

table of contents management fees we provide a broad range of investment management strategies  specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations  public funds  and other sophisticated investors 
these services are offered through ssga 
based upon assets under management  ssga is the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide  the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations primarily pension plans in the united states  and the third largest investment manager overall in the world 
ssga offers a broad array of investment management strategies  including passive and active  such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies  using quantitative and fundamental methods for both us and global equities and fixed income securities 
ssga also offers exchange traded funds  or etfs  such as the spdr dividend etfs 
the decrease in management fees from primarily resulted from declines in average month end equity market valuations and lower performance fees 
average month end equity market valuations  individually presented in the above index table  were down an average of compared to the decrease in performance fees from million in to million in was generally the result of reduced levels of assets under management subject to performance fees  and somewhat lower relative performance measured against specified benchmarks during management fees generated from customers outside the united states were approximately of total management fees for  down slightly from for at year end  assets under management were trillion  compared to trillion at year end while certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed  management fees reflect other factors as well  including our relationship pricing for customers who use multiple services  and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees 
accordingly  no direct correlation necessarily exists between the value of assets under management  market indices and management fee revenue 
the overall decrease in assets under management at december  compared to december  resulted from declines in market valuations and from a net loss of business  with declines in market valuations representing the substantial majority of the decrease 
during  we experienced an aggregate net loss of business of approximately billion  compared to net new business of approximately billion during our levels of assets under management were affected by a number of factors  including investor issues related to ssga s active fixed income strategies and the relative under performance of certain of our passive equity products 
the net loss of business of billion for did not reflect new business awarded to us during that had not been installed prior to december  this new business will be reflected in assets under management in future periods after installation

the following table presents a roll forward of assets under management for the three years ended december assets under management years ended december  in billions balance at beginning of year net new business market appreciation depreciation balance at end of year trading services trading services revenue includes revenue from foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other trading services 
we offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our customers for our proprietary research and to execute trades in any time zone 
foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors the volume and type of customer foreign exchange transactions  currency volatility  and the management of currency market risks 
for  foreign exchange trading revenue totaled billion for  a increase from revenue of million  and benefited from the continued disruption in the global securities markets 
the increase was mainly driven by a increase in currency volatility  but also included an increase of million of foreign exchange revenue attributable to the inclusion of a full year of revenue of the acquired investors financial business compared to two quarters for aggregate customer volumes were relatively flat compared to we also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community  including transition management  commission recapture and self directed brokerage 
these products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor 
brokerage and other trading fees of million were up compared to revenue of million 
the increase was attributable to higher electronic trading revenues from both the acquired currenex business and from our global link product  as well as an increase in brokerage revenue  principally transition management and equity trading 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in trading profits 
securities finance securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets and an effective means for customers to earn revenue on their existing portfolios 
by acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers  we lend securities and provide liquidity to customers around the world 
borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to state street in return for loaned securities 
for cash collateral  we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral  and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles or managed accounts 
the spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and state street as agent 
for non cash collateral  the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities  and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and state street 
securities finance revenue is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan and the interest rate spreads earned on the underlying collateral 
for  securities finance revenue increased from a year earlier  primarily as a result of wider credit spreads across all lending programs  partially offset by a decrease in 
table of contents lending volumes 
spreads benefited from the federal reserve s aggregate basis point reduction in the federal funds rate during  as well as continued disruption of the global fixed income securities markets 
beginning in the third quarter of  a number of institutional investors suspended or limited their participation in our securities lending program  resulting in lower lending volumes 
the decreased lending volumes are expected to continue as long as this suspended or limited participation continues 
during  we experienced significant withdrawal activity from the underlying collateral pools  primarily to allow the lending programs to meet mark to market changes in collateral agreements caused by declines in the values of securities on loan or the return of borrowed securities  with a net reduction of the value of securities on loan from june  to december  of approximately 
we were able to manage these outflows of cash collateral  as well as the impact of the disruptions in the credit markets  in a manner that substantially reduced the risk of loss to our customers 
however  we imposed limitations on withdrawals from our lending programs in order to manage the liquidity in the cash collateral pools  and the net asset value of our cash collateral pools  determined using market valuations  has fallen below per unit 
we cannot determine how long these limitations will remain in place  nor can we determine how long market illiquidity will continue to affect the valuation of the collateral pools 
the continuation of either trend could materially affect the longer term prospects for our securities lending business 
we continue to distinguish our securities lending program from those of our competitors due to the absence to date of realized credit losses with respect to our program 
processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and other revenue  including fees from our structured products business  fees from software licensing and maintenance  equity income from joint venture investments  gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets  and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings 
processing fees and other revenue were relatively flat compared to  with the benefit of two additional quarters of revenue from the acquired investors financial business for compared to  offset by lower levels of equity income from joint venture investments

the growth in deposits was a significant contributor to the overall increase in average interest earning assets 

table of contents average other short term borrowings decreased million  or  to billion for  primarily due to higher customer deposits 
average long term debt increased million  or  to billion for due to a debt issuance in mid and an additional debt issuance in the first quarter of to enhance our regulatory capital position 
additional information about our long term debt is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item several factors could affect future levels of net interest revenue and margin  including the mix of customer liabilities  actions of the various central banks  changes in us and us interest rates  and the shapes of the various yield curves around the world 
in addition  we expect that our actions announced in february with respect to our plan to improve our tangible common equity  described earlier under financial highlights  and which include the reinvestment of investment securities paying down and maturing during into interest bearing deposits and a resulting reduction in the size of our consolidated balance sheet  will reduce net interest revenue and margin for gains losses related to investment securities  net we recorded net gains of million from sales of available for sale securities for  compared to a net gain of million in in addition  we recorded other than temporary impairment of million in  compared to million in  which resulted from our impairment analysis process 
management regularly reviews the investment securities portfolio to determine whether it expects any loss of principal or interest  in light of current market and economic conditions  consideration of pertinent information and related expectations 
as a result of this process  management identified securities that it believed were other than temporarily impaired 
additional information about available for sale securities  and the gross gains and losses that compose the net sale gains  is in the financial condition section of this management s discussion and analysis and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item gain on sale of citistreet interest  net of exit and other associated costs on july   we completed the sale of our joint venture interest in citistreet  a benefits servicing business that provides retirement plan recordkeeping and administrative services and at that date had approximately billion in assets under administration on behalf of corporate and government entities  employee unions and other customers 
the premium received in connection with the sale was million  and we recorded a resulting pre tax gain of million in our consolidated statement of income during the third quarter of  net of exit and other associated costs incurred in connection with the sale 
these costs totaled million  and consisted of incentive compensation of million  professional fees of million  and other related costs of million

table of contents the increase in salaries and employee benefits for compared to was driven primarily by an increase of approximately million of salaries and benefits expense of the acquired investors financial business  the impact of higher staffing levels to support new business  higher average salaries and benefits expense and increased contract services spending 
these increases were partly offset by a decline in incentive compensation 
the increase in information systems and communications expense for included an additional million in expenses from the acquired investors financial business compared to  as well as an increase in spending on telecommunications hardware and software 
transaction processing services expenses are volume related  and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement  sub custodian services and external contract services 
the increase over resulted primarily from higher transaction volumes and external contract services  primarily in europe 
occupancy expense increased from  primarily due to additional leased space acquired to support growth in the hedge funds servicing and investment manager operations outsourcing businesses  as well as higher occupancy costs in support of growth in europe  including our new facility in the uk during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net pre tax charge of million in connection with the establishment of a reserve to address litigation exposure and other costs associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by ssga and customer concerns as to whether the execution of these strategies was consistent with customers investment intent 
the net charge had the following components a provision for legal exposure of million offset by million of insurance coverage net provision of million  a million reduction of salaries and benefits expense related to reduced incentive compensation primarily associated with ssga  offset by million of severance costs  and million of other expenses related to professional fees 
information with respect to activity in the balance sheet reserve during is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item during the fourth quarter of  we elected to provide support to certain investment accounts managed by ssga through the purchase of asset and mortgage backed securities and a cash infusion  which resulted in a charge of million 
these accounts  offered to retirement plans  allow participants to purchase and redeem units at a constant net asset value regardless of volatility in the underlying value of the assets held by the account 
the accounts enter into contractual arrangements with independent third party financial institutions that agree to make up any shortfall in the account if all the units are redeemed at the constant net asset value 
the financial institutions have the right  under certain circumstances  to terminate this guarantee with respect to future investments in the account 
during  the liquidity and pricing issues in the fixed income markets adversely affected the market value of the securities in these accounts to the point that the third party guarantors considered terminating their financial guarantees with the accounts 
although we were not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so  we elected to purchase approximately billion of asset and mortgage backed securities from these accounts that had been identified as presenting increased risk in the current market environment and to contribute an aggregate of million to the accounts to improve the ratio of the market value of the accounts portfolio holdings to the book value of the accounts 
we have no ongoing commitment or intent to provide support to these accounts 
the asset and mortgage backed securities are carried in investment securities available for sale in our consolidated statement of condition 
in december  we announced a plan to reduce our operating costs and support our long term growth while aligning the organization to meet the challenges and opportunities presented by the current market environment 
as a primary component of this plan  we initiated a reduction of approximately of our global workforce  which reduction we expect to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of in connection with this plan  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded aggregate restructuring charges of million 
we expect that this plan will result in an annualized reduction of our expenses from operations of between million and million 
additional information with respect to the charges  and activity during in the related balance sheet reserve  is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item 
table of contents during  in connection with the investors financial acquisition  we recorded merger and integration costs of million compared to million for these costs consisted only of direct and incremental costs to integrate the acquired investors financial business into our operations  and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization 
the costs were primarily related to employee retention and system and customer integration 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a million reserve to provide for our estimated net exposure on an indemnification obligation associated with collateralized repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman brothers holdings inc  or lehman brothers 
in september and october  lehman brothers and certain of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings 
while we had no unsecured financial exposure to lehman brothers or its affiliates  we indemnified certain customers in connection with these and other collateralized repurchase agreements with lehman brothers entities 
in the then current market environment  the market value of the underlying collateral had declined 
to the extent that these declines resulted in collateral value falling below the indemnification obligation  we recorded a reserve 
the reserve was based on the cost of satisfying the indemnification obligation net of the fair value of the collateral 
we purchased the collateral  composed of commercial real estate loans  during the fourth quarter of as described in the loans and lease financing section of this managements discussion and analysis 
we had other customer indemnification obligations under a collateralized repurchase agreement with another lehman brothers entity 
in these cases  the fair value of the collateral at the time we committed to take possession of it was equal to or greater than the associated indemnification obligation and therefore no related reserve was recorded 
we will continue to evaluate these assets and collateral and determine whether to dispose of them or hold them to maturity 
the market value of these assets and collateral will continue to fluctuate and ultimately may be less than the value of our indemnification obligations 
the increase in aggregate other expenses professional services  securities processing  amortization of other intangible assets  regulator fees and assessments and other from million for to billion for resulted from a increase in professional services spending  primarily legal and consulting costs  amortization of other intangible assets for the full year in connection with the acquisitions of investors financial and currenex  higher securities processing costs and higher regulatory fees and assessments  the latter mainly fees and assessments paid in connection with our participation in certain federal government and banking regulatory agency programs described earlier in the impact of securities markets disruption and government actions section

table of contents the increase in total revenue for compared to primarily reflected growth in fee revenue  which mainly reflected growth in servicing and management fees  with almost of the overall growth in fee revenue generated from these two services 
the increase in servicing fees was the result of the inclusion of servicing fee revenue from the acquired investors financial business  the impact of net new business from existing and new customers  higher average equity market valuations and higher customer transaction volumes 
approximately of our servicing fees were derived from non us customers in  down from in the decrease in the non us proportion reflected the contribution of servicing fees from the acquired investors financial business  which are generated predominately in the us assets under custody increased to trillion at december   up from trillion a year earlier  with the majority of the increase the result of the addition of assets under custody of the acquired investors financial business 
the increase in management fees from primarily resulted from the impact of net new business on revenue and higher equity market valuations 
approximately of management fees were derived from customers outside the us in  up from for assets under management increased to trillion at december   up billion from trillion a year earlier 
the growth in trading services revenue  which includes foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other trading revenue  reflected an increase in foreign exchange trading revenue of million  primarily due to increased customer volumes  but also the result of the inclusion of million of foreign exchange revenue from the acquired investors financial business 
brokerage and other fees increased from million in  up to million in due to the contribution of revenue from the acquired currenex business and an increase in revenue from transition management 
the increase in securities finance revenue reflected the effect of increased loan volumes resulting from both new customer demands and increased demand from existing customers 
spreads also increased  primarily in the domestic and non us equity portfolios and the corporate bond and fixed income portfolios 
spreads benefited from reductions in federal funds rates during the increase in net interest revenue was the result of several favorable trends 
transaction deposit volume increased  particularly with respect to non us deposits 
volume increases resulted from net new business in non us assets under custody  and spreads increased because deposit rates lagged rate increases by foreign central banks during the acquired investors financial business added interest earning assets and related net interest revenue

information systems and communications expense increased due to the addition of expenses of the acquired investors financial business as well as increased spending internationally to support growth 
transaction processing services expenses  which in large part are volume related  include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement  sub custodian fees and external contract services 
the increase resulted from the addition of approximately million of expenses from the acquired investors financial business  specifically sub custody costs  as well as higher transaction volumes  and external contract services  primarily in europe 
occupancy expense increased primarily due to additional leased space acquired as part of the investors financial acquisition  as well as higher occupancy costs in support of growth in europe

our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item the majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application  or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of these accounting policies  by their nature  require management to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements 
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying policies  estimates and assumptions  the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as accounting for fair value measurements  accounting for special purpose entities  and accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
these policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and related estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies 
management of state street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the examining and audit committee of our board of directors 
fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis  including trading account assets  investment securities available for sale and various types of derivative instruments 
as discussed in further detail below  changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income  or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition 
in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements  we disclose the fair value in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of certain other of our financial assets and liabilities that are carried at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition 
we estimate the fair value of all of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below 
at december   approximately billion of our assets and approximately billion of our liabilities were carried at fair value  compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  the amounts at december  represented approximately of our consolidated total assets and approximately of our consolidated total liabilities  compared to and  respectively  at december  the decrease in the relative percentages as of december   compared to december   resulted primarily from a significant increase in our consolidated total assets  which increase was mostly due to the impact of higher levels of customer deposits and the purchase of asset backed commercial paper under the previously discussed amlf during  neither of which is carried at fair value 
as described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  effective january  the standard does not require the measurement of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value  but provides a consistent definition of fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
we have not elected the fair value option for any of our financial assets or financial liabilities since our adoption of the standard  although we may do so in the future 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact  and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
when possible  we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical  or similar  financial assets or liabilities 
when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets  we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities 
in some instances  certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets  and as a result we use alternative valuation techniques to measure their fair value 
in accordance with the standard  we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition based upon the standard s three level valuation hierarchy 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs level 
we categorized approximately of our financial assets carried at fair value in level  in level and in level of the fair value hierarchy  including the effect of master netting agreements 
we categorized approximately of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level  with the remaining in level  including the effect of master netting agreements 

table of contents the fair value of the investment securities categorized in level was composed of us treasury securities  specifically treasury bills  which have a maturity of one year or less 
fair value was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 
the fair value of the investment securities categorized in level was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties 
information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a continuous validation process 
management has developed a process to review information provided by third parties  including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions 
in addition  management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information 
such information may include known trades or  to the extent that trading activity is limited  comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations  execution prices and the timing of cash flows 
the fair value of the derivative instruments categorized in level predominantly represented foreign exchange contracts used in our trading activities  for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points  as well as observable interest rate curves 
with respect to derivative instruments  we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit 
we considered factors such as the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties  our net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value 
valuation adjustments associated with these factors were not significant for while the substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level were composed of asset backed securities available for sale  primarily securities collateralized by student loans  level also included trading account assets  composed of corporate debt securities  and foreign exchange options 
the categorization of asset backed securities in level as of december  was significantly influenced by current conditions  including reduced levels of liquidity  in the fixed income securities markets 
little or no market activity for these securities occurred during the fourth quarter of  and as a result of the lack of price transparency  we measured their fair value using unobservable pricing inputs  such as spread indices and non binding quotes received directly from third parties 
these inputs were subject to management s review and were determined to be appropriate based on individual facts and circumstances 
generally  we obtain non binding quotes from market specialists for each individual security as necessary 
given the unique nature of each underlying security structure  it is not practical or useful to obtain multiple quotes for individual securities 
the aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level as of december   compared to january   increased approximately 
the change resulted primarily from purchases of corporate debt securities and transfers in of investment securities available for sale  principally student loan backed securities  partly offset by unrealized losses on available for sale securities recorded in other comprehensive income and the reclassification of certain classes of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations to level special purpose entities in the normal course of business  we utilize three types of special purpose entities  referred to as spes 
one type of spe is utilized in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles  and is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
a second type of spe is utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment program  and is recorded in our consolidated financial statements  since we treat the underlying transactions as secured borrowings  not as sales 
additional information about the activities of these spes is provided in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item additional information about the third type of spe  used in connection with our commercial paper program  is provided below 
in our role as a financial intermediary  we administer four third party asset backed commercial paper conduits  which are structured as bankruptcy remote  limited liability companies  and which are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
these conduits purchase a variety of financial assets from third party financial institutions  and fund these purchases by issuing commercial paper 
the financial assets purchased by 
table of contents the conduits are not originated by us  and we do not hold any equity ownership interest in the conduits 
detailed information about the conduits and their business activities is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item during the first quarter of  pursuant to the contractual terms of our liquidity asset purchase agreements with the four unconsolidated asset backed commercial paper conduits that we administer  we were required to purchase million of conduit assets 
the purchase was the result of various factors  including the continued illiquidity in the commercial paper markets 
the securities were purchased at prices determined in accordance with existing contractual terms in the liquidity asset purchase agreements  and which exceeded their fair value 
accordingly  during the first quarter of  the securities were written down to fair value through a million reduction of processing fees and other revenue in our consolidated statement of income  and are carried at fair value in securities available for sale in our consolidated statement of condition 
none of our liquidity asset purchase agreements with the conduits was drawn upon during the remainder of  and no draw downs on the standby letters of credit occurred during we sometimes purchase commercial paper from the conduits to support their liquidity 
as the disruption in the financial markets continued through  our support of the conduits liquidity resulted in our purchasing historically high levels of commercial paper from them 
on december  and  we held million and million  respectively  of commercial paper issued by the conduits in trading account assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
the amount held at december  did not include billion sold by the conduits to the federal reserve s cpff 
the highest total overnight position including amlf in the conduits commercial paper held by us during the year ended december   was approximately billion 
the average total overnight position including amlf for the same period was approximately billion 
as of february   we held billion of the conduits commercial paper and billion had been sold by the conduits to the federal reserve s cpff 
the cpff is currently scheduled to expire for new issuances on october  the weighted average maturity of the conduits commercial paper in the aggregate was approximately days as of december   compared to approximately days as of december  our accounting for the conduits activities  and our conclusion that we are not required to include each or all of the conduits assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  is based on our application of the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
r  which governs our accounting for the conduits and which is discussed in more detail in note expected losses  which we estimate using a financial model as described below  form the basis for our application of the provisions of fin r 
expected losses  as defined by fin r  are not economic losses 
instead  expected losses are calculated by comparing projected possible cash flows  which are probability weighted  with expected cash flows for the risk s the entity was designed to create and distribute  they represent the variability in potential cash flows of the entity s designated risks 
we believe that credit risk is the predominant risk that is designed to be created and distributed by these entities 
the conduits also have a modest amount of basis risk 
basis risk arises when commercial paper funding costs change at a different rate than the comparable floating rate asset benchmark rates generally libor 
this risk is managed through the use of derivative instruments  principally basis swaps  which mitigate this variability for each conduit 
any credit losses of the conduits would be absorbed by investors in the subordinated debt  commonly referred to as first loss notes  issued by the conduits  state street or other providers of liquidity or credit enhancement  and the holders of the conduits commercial paper  in that order of priority 
the investors in the first loss notes  which are independent third parties  would absorb the first dollar of any credit loss on the conduits assets 
if credit losses exceeded the first loss notes  we would absorb credit losses through our credit facilities provided to the conduits 
the commercial paper holders would absorb credit losses after the first loss notes and state street s and other providers credit facilities have been exhausted 
we have developed a financial model to estimate and allocate each conduit s expected losses 
this model has determined that  as of december   the amount of first loss notes of each conduit held by the third party investors causes them to absorb a majority of each conduit s expected losses  as defined by fin r  and  accordingly  the investors in the first loss notes are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits 
the aggregate amount of first loss notes issued by the conduits totaled approximately million as of december  
table of contents in order to estimate expected losses as required by fin r  we estimate possible defaults of the conduits assets 
these expected losses are allocated to the conduits variable interest holders based on the order in which actual losses would be absorbed  as described above 
we use the model to estimate expected losses based on hundreds of thousands of probability weighted loss scenarios 
these simulations incorporate published credit rating agency data to estimate expected losses due to credit risk 
primary assumptions incorporated into the financial model relative to credit risk variability  such as default probabilities and loss severities  are directly linked to the conduits underlying assets 
these default probabilities and loss severity assumptions vary by asset class and ratings of individual conduit assets 
accordingly  the model s calculation of expected losses is significantly affected by the credit ratings and asset mix of each conduit s assets 
these statistics are periodically reviewed by management 
if downgrades and asset mix change significantly  or if defaults occur on the conduits underlying assets  we may conclude that the current level of first loss notes is insufficient to absorb a majority of the conduits expected losses 
we perform stress tests and sensitivity analyses on each conduit individually  to model potential scenarios that could cause the amount of first loss notes to be insufficient to absorb the majority of the conduits expected losses 
as part of these analyses  we have identified certain conduit assets that could be more susceptible to credit downgrade because of their underlying credit characteristics 
our scenario testing specifically addresses asset classes that have experienced significant price erosion and or have little observed market activity 
examples of scenarios that are designed to measure the sensitivity of the sufficiency of the first loss notes include performing a downgrade of all assets which have underlying monoline insurance provider support  and a downgrade scenario on certain other conduit securities where our analysis of the timing and amount of expected cash flows for selected security default expectations does not re affirm the security s current external credit rating 
these simulations do not include a scenario whereby all positions are simultaneously downgraded  the possibility of which we consider remote 
in addition  a scenario could arise where one or more defaults could be so severe that the associated losses would exhaust the conduits total first loss notes currently outstanding 
certain of the conduits hold asset backed securities that have the benefit of a third party guarantee from a financial guaranty insurance company 
the aggregate amortized cost of securities with underlying guarantees was approximately billion at december  and billion at december  certain of these securities  which totaled approximately million at december   are currently drawing on the underlying guarantees in order to make contractual principal and interest payments to the conduits 
in these cases  the performance of the underlying security is highly dependent on the performance of the guarantor 
in calculating expected losses  these securities carry the higher of the underlying security rating or the rating of the third party guarantor 
during  many of these guarantors experienced ratings downgrades 
the credit ratings of the guarantors ranged from aaa to ccc as of december  none of these securities are in default 
in the future  as a result of our stress tests  if the determination and allocation of conduit expected losses by the financial model indicates that the then existing level of first loss notes would be insufficient to absorb a majority of the conduits expected losses  we would be required to either issue additional first loss notes to third parties  change the composition of conduit assets  or take other actions in order to avoid being determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits on the date of determination 
under existing accounting standards  if we were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits and were required to consolidate the conduits into our consolidated financial statements  based on changes in assumptions or future events  the conduits assets and liabilities would be consolidated at their respective fair values 
we would recognize a loss if the fair value of the conduits aggregate liabilities and first loss notes exceeded the fair value of their aggregate assets 
management believes that this loss would be recovered in future periods  as with our investment securities portfolio  we expect that we would collect substantially all principal and interest on the assets according to their underlying contractual terms 
the fair value of the conduits aggregate liabilities and first loss notes exceeded the fair value of their aggregate assets by billion after tax at december  based on the difference in the fair value of the conduits aggregate liabilities and first loss notes and their aggregate assets of billion after tax  the consolidation of the conduits assets would reduce our tier and total risk based capital ratios 
the impact of consolidation on our tier leverage ratio would be more significant  
table of contents but the degree of impact would depend on how and when consolidation occurred  since this ratio is a function of our consolidated total average assets over an entire quarter 
for illustrative purposes  assuming estimated fair values of the conduits assets as of december   if all of the conduits assets and liabilities were consolidated onto our consolidated balance sheet on december   the following table presents the estimated impact on state street s and state street bank s regulatory capital ratios as of that date 
state street state street bank reported as of december  adjusted for conduit consolidation as of december  reported as of december  adjusted for conduit consolidation as of december  tier leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio the conduits do not regularly trade their assets 
that is  the design of the conduits is such that conduit assets are purchased with the intent to hold them to their maturities 
accordingly  changes in the fair values of the conduits assets do not impact the day to day management of the conduits 
we believe the fair values of the conduits assets are affected by a number of factors  including the lack of liquidity of mortgage and asset backed securities  supply and demand imbalance in the market  and a risk aversion premium being demanded by investors for certain asset types 
the aggregate fair value of the conduits assets at december  and was billion and billion  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses  and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
other acquired identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value 
goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  and both are subject to impairment adjustment if events or circumstances indicate the potential inability to realize the carrying amount 
we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually  based on undiscounted cash flows 
almost all of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition have resulted from business acquisitions of our investment servicing line of business 
the remainder have been recorded by investment management 
the sustained value of the majority of goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary  be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our two major business lines 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price 

table of contents to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment  we use one of two principal methodologies external or independent valuation  using quoted market prices in active markets  or an analysis of comparable recent external sales or market data  such as multiples of earnings or similar performance measures 
in limited circumstances  these methodologies are not available  and as such  we estimate future cash flows using present value techniques 
events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate 
additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets  including information by line of business  is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment for indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired

table of contents overview of consolidated statement of condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition  or balance sheet  is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses 
as our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities  they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities 
these liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction account deposits  which are denominated in a variety of currencies  and repurchase agreements  which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers 
our customers needs and our operating objectives determine the volume  mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet 
deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities 
as a result  our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity portfolios and short term money market instruments  such as interest bearing deposits  federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets 
managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is conducted within specific board approved policies for interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity 
for  the growth in average interest bearing liabilities of billion was primarily composed of an billion increase in customer deposits  billion of which were foreign  partially offset by a decline in repurchase agreements of billion 
average interest earning assets in increased billion from  primarily the result of higher levels of interest bearing deposits with domestic and foreign central banks related to the investment of excess cash generated from customers accumulation of liquidity  as well as our purchase of asset backed commercial paper under the amlf

the percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio by external credit rating  excluding securities purchased under the amlf  were as follows as of december aaa aa a bbb bb non rated includes us treasury securities 
the investment securities portfolio is also diversified with respect to asset class 
the majority of the portfolio is composed of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists of home equity loan  credit card  auto and student loan backed securities 
mortgage backed securities are split between securities of federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation and large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations 
as of december   the asset backed securities in the portfolio included billion collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
of this total  were aaa rated and were aa rated 
we had billion of net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities at december   or billion after tax 
this unrealized loss excludes the unrealized loss of billion  or billion after tax  related to securities available for sale that were reclassified to securities held to maturity during the fourth quarter of  which are discussed below 
net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities at december  were billion  or million after tax 
excluding the securities for which million of other than temporary impairment was recorded during  management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities 
management continues to believe that it is probable that we will collect all principal and interest according to underlying contractual terms  and has the ability and the intent to hold the securities until recovery in market value 
during the fourth quarter of  management reassessed its classification of certain asset and mortgage backed securities carried in the available for sale portfolio  and reclassified securities with an amortized cost of billion and a fair value of billion to securities held to maturity 
no gain or loss was recognized at the time of reclassification 
the related pre tax unrealized loss of billion  or billion after tax  recorded in other comprehensive income  or oci  remained in oci and is being amortized as an adjustment of the yield of the reclassified securities over their remaining terms 
the securities were reclassified at their then fair value of billion  and this fair value was established as the adjusted amortized cost of the reclassified securities 
the resulting discount is being accreted as an adjustment of the yield of the reclassified securities over their remaining terms 
as a result  the reclassification will have no ultimate impact on our consolidated results of operations 
management considers the held to maturity classification to be appropriate because it has the ability and the intent to hold these securities to their maturity 
we intend to continue managing our investment securities portfolio to align with interest rate and duration characteristics of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure  which is maintained within internally approved risk limits  and in consideration of the global interest rate environment 
even with material changes in unrealized losses on available for sale securities  we may not experience material changes in our interest rate risk profile  or experience a material impact on our net interest revenue

table of contents us commercial and financial loans at december  included approximately million of commercial real estate loans purchased from certain customers pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman brothers 
we recorded a reserve of million associated with performance under the indemnification agreement during the third quarter of  representing the difference between our indemnification obligation and the fair value of the loans acquired 
we paid billion to settle the indemnification obligations  and the acquired loans had an estimated fair value of million 
the contractual legal balance of the acquired loans is approximately billion

capital regulatory and economic capital management both use key metrics evaluated by management to assess whether our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile  is in compliance with all regulatory requirements  and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives 
regulatory capital our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs  including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs  and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
we strive to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with our risk profile  on which an attractive return to shareholders will be realized over both the short and long term  while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory requirements 
our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures  our capital position relative to our peers  regulatory capital requirements and the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt 
our capital committee  working in conjunction with our asset and liability committee  referred to as alco  oversees the management of regulatory capital  and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements  internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies 
the primary regulator of both state street and state street bank for regulatory capital purposes is the federal reserve 
both state street and state street bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 
table of contents of state street bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company 
regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for state street and state street bank were as follows as of december regulatory guidelines state street state street bank minimum well capitalized regulatory capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier leverage ratio regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to state street bank 
tier and total risk based capital and tier leverage ratios exclude the impact of the asset backed commercial paper purchased under the amlf  as permitted by the amlf s terms and conditions 
at december   state street s and state street bank s regulatory capital ratios increased compared to year end the increases for state street resulted primarily from the issuance of capital eligible debt securities in january  the june public offering of our common stock and our participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program in october described further below  as well as net income 
with respect to state street bank  the parent company contributed an aggregate of approximately billion to state street bank during to enhance its equity capital 
for state street and state street bank  these increases in capital more than offset increases in on and off balance risk weighted assets primarily associated with the impact of increases in customer deposits and higher volumes of foreign exchange derivative contracts 
all ratios for state street and state street bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds 
in january  state street capital trust iii  a delaware statutory trust wholly owned by the parent company  issued million in aggregate liquidation amount of fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities  referred to as normal apex  and used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of remarketable junior subordinated debentures due from the parent company 
in addition  the trust entered into stock purchase contracts with the parent company under which the trust agrees to purchase  and the parent company agrees to sell  on the stock purchase date  a like amount in aggregate liquidation amount of the parent company s non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a   liquidation preference per share 
state street will make contract payments to the trust at an annual rate of of the stated amount of  per stock purchase contract 
the normal apex are beneficial interests in the trust 
the trust will pass through  as distributions on or the redemption price of normal apex  amounts that it receives on its assets that are the corresponding assets for the normal apex 
the corresponding assets for each normal apex   liquidation amount  initially are  principal amount of the junior subordinated debentures and a th  or a  interest in a stock purchase contract for the purchase and sale of one share of the series a preferred stock for  the stock purchase date is expected to be march   but it may occur on an earlier date or as late as march  from and after the stock purchase date  the corresponding asset for each normal apex will be a th  or a  interest in one share of the series a preferred stock 
in accordance with existing accounting standards  we did not record the trust in our consolidated financial statements 
the junior debentures qualify for inclusion in tier regulatory capital 
capital purchase program on october   in connection with the us treasury s capital purchase program  we issued  shares of our series b fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock   liquidation preference per share  and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  to treasury  and received aggregate proceeds of billion 

table of contents the preferred shares  which qualify as tier regulatory capital  pay cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years  and per year thereafter 
the preferred shares are non voting  other than class voting rights on certain matters that could adversely affect the shares 
we can redeem the preferred shares at par after december  prior to this date  we can only redeem the preferred shares at par in an amount up to the cash proceeds minimum million from qualifying equity offerings of any tier eligible perpetual preferred or common stock 
any redemption is subject to the consent of the federal reserve 
until october   or such earlier time as the preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred by treasury  we are not permitted  without treasury s consent  to increase the quarterly dividend per share on our common stock above per share  or to repurchase our common stock 
the warrant is immediately exercisable  and has a year term 
the exercise price of per share was based upon the average of the closing prices of our common stock during the trading day period ended october   the last trading day prior to our election to participate in the program 
the exercise price and number of common shares subject to the warrant are both subject to anti dilution adjustments 
if we receive aggregate gross cash proceeds of at least billion from one or more qualifying equity offerings of tier eligible perpetual preferred or common stock on or prior to december   the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrant then held by treasury will be reduced by one half of the original number of common shares  considering all adjustments  underlying the warrant 
common stock on june   we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the public offering price was per share  and aggregate proceeds from the offering  net of underwriting commissions and related offering costs  totaled approximately billion 
underwriting commissions totaled approximately million 
of the total shares issued  approximately million shares were issued out of treasury stock  and the remaining million shares were newly issued 
we executed the offering pursuant to our current universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
in january  under an existing authorization by our board of directors  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in connection with a billion accelerated share repurchase program that concluded on january  as of december   approximately  shares remained available for future purchase under the board authorization 
we generally employ third party broker dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our common stock purchase program 
funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources 
the level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock  which totaled million per share in compared to million and per share in  is reviewed regularly and determined by the board of directors considering our liquidity  capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects  as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company 
in addition  banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice 
information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item during the first quarter of  in light of the continued disruption in the global capital markets experienced since the middle of  and as part of a plan to strengthen our tangible common equity  we announced a temporary reduction of our quarterly dividend on our common stock to per share 
other in  the committee on banking supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework  referred to as basel ii 
in  the four us banking regulatory agencies jointly issued their second draft of implementation rules  with industry comment provided by the end of march additional 
table of contents supervisory guidance from the agencies was released late in february  comments to the agencies were provided by the end of may  and the final rules were released on december   with a stated effective date of april  state street previously established a comprehensive implementation program to ensure these regulatory requirements are met within prescribed timeframes 
we anticipate adopting the most advanced approaches for assessing capital adequacy 
economic capital we define economic capital as the capital required to protect holders of our senior debt  and obligations higher in priority  against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target aa senior debt rating 
our capital committee is responsible for overseeing our economic capital process 
the framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our enterprise risk management  global treasury and corporate finance groups and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles and the new basel ii regulatory capital rules 
this framework has been approved by senior management and the executive committee of the board of directors 
due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques  we expect to periodically refine the methodologies  assumptions  and data used to estimate our economic capital requirements  which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our business activities 
we quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories market risk the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices  primarily as they relate to our trading activities  interest rate risk the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions  primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities  credit risk the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty  operational risk the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events  which is consistent with the basel ii definition  and business risk the risk of negative earnings resulting from adverse changes in business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of our business activities  and the effect of strategic and reputation risks 
economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and  in some cases  external data 
these individual results are then aggregated at the state street consolidated level 
a capital reduction or diversification benefit is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner  and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise 
effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions 
significant uses of liquidity  described more fully below  consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals and funding outstanding commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities as they are drawn upon 
liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and by our consolidated balance sheet asset structure 
our global treasury group is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position  which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by alco 
management maintains a liquidity 
table of contents measurement framework to assess the sources and uses of liquidity that is monitored by global treasury and our enterprise risk management group 
embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty 
these triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets 
another important component of the framework is a contingency funding plan that is designed to identify and manage through a potential liquidity crisis 
the plan defines roles  responsibilities and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a state street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets 
specific actions are linked to the levels of triggers 
we generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level 
we also manage parent company liquidity  and in certain cases branch liquidity  separately 
state street bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks  specifically the federal funds market and the federal reserve s discount window and term auction facility 
the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile  reflecting narrower market access 
we typically hold enough cash  primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks  to meet current debt maturities and cash needs  as well as those projected over the next one year period 
sources of liquidity come from two primary areas access to the global capital markets and liquid assets maintained on our consolidated balance sheet 
our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would tap to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below 
on balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy 
these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets  but more importantly  they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales 
each of these sources of liquidity is used in the management of daily cash needs and in a crisis scenario  where we would need to accommodate potential large  unexpected demand for funds 
uses of liquidity result from the following withdrawals of unsecured customer deposits  draw downs on unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities  generally provided through lines of credit  overdraft facilities  liquidity asset purchase agreements supporting the four unconsolidated asset backed commercial paper conduits that we administer  and purchases by us of commercial paper issued by the conduits to support their liquidity 
customer deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities  and are invested in a combination of term investment securities and short term money market assets whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits 
most of the customer deposits are payable upon demand or are short term in nature  which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts 
similarly  customers can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit  or can overdraw deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes 
in addition  a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements  such as under liquidity asset purchase agreements that have met draw down conditions  or large draw downs of existing lines of credit  could require additional liquidity 
material risks to sources of short term liquidity could include  among other things  adverse changes in the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition or liquidity needs  and downgrades by major independent credit rating agencies of our deposits and our debt securities  which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and could lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers 
in managing our liquidity  we have issued term wholesale certificates of deposit and invested those funds in short term money market assets where they would be available to meet cash needs 
this portfolio stood at billion at december   compared to billion at december  in conjunction with our management of liquidity where we seek to maintain access to sources of back up liquidity at reasonable costs  we have participated in the federal reserve s term auction facility  which is a secured lending program available to financial institutions that was established in december as of december   state street bank s borrowings under the term auction facility totaled billion  which represented the highest level of state street bank s borrowings under this facility for the aggregate certificate of deposit and term auction facility balances were higher at december  compared to december   as state street bank held greater 
table of contents liquidity in light of the continued disruption in the financial markets 
we did not experience any net deterioration in our customer deposit base during while maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program  on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control  and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral 
our liquid assets consist primarily of cash balances at central banks in excess of regulatory requirements and other short term liquid assets  such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks  the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks  and high quality  marketable investment securities not already pledged  which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to generate cash quickly 
as of december   the cash value of our liquid assets  as defined  totaled billion  compared to billion as of december  the increase was mainly the result of a significant increase in customer deposits in the third quarter of as the credit markets worsened 
as customers accumulated liquidity  they placed cash with us 
the vast majority of these incremental customer deposits remained with state street bank at year end due to the unusual size and volatile nature of these incremental customer deposits  we chose to maintain approximately billion at central banks as of december   in excess of regulatory required minimums 
securities carried at billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits  borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law  and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation  unless pledged to the federal reserve bank of boston 
the liquid assets and pledged securities described above excluded securities purchased under the federal reserve s amlf 
liquid assets included securities pledged to the federal reserve bank of boston to secure our ability to borrow from their discount window should the need arise 
this access to primary credit is an important source of back up liquidity for state street bank 
as of december   we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the discount window 
based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration  management considers overall liquidity at december  to be sufficient to meet state street s current commitments and business needs  including supporting the liquidity of the commercial paper conduits and accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our customers 
as referenced above  our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt  as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies 
factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings  strong risk management  strong capital ratios  diverse liquidity sources  including the global capital markets and customer deposits  and strong liquidity monitoring procedures 
high ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt 
a downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates

additional information about the commercial commitments disclosed in this section is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item risk management the global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function 
the measurement  monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation 
our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital 

table of contents we have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management 
the board of directors provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs  including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of state street s key risk indicators 
these indicators are designed to identify major business activities of state street with significant risk content  and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement 
key risk indicators are reported regularly to the executive committee of the board and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness 
modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements 
enterprise risk management  or erm  a dedicated corporate group  provides oversight  support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines 
in addition  erm establishes and reviews approved limits  and with business line management  monitors key risks 
the head of erm meets regularly with the board or a board committee  as appropriate  and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary 
the execution of duties in the management of people  products  business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers 
the function of risk management is responsible for designing  orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards 
accordingly  risk management is a shared responsibility between erm and the business lines and requires joint efforts in goal setting  program design and implementation  resource management  and performance evaluation between business and functional units 
responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees 
the major risk committee  or mrc  is responsible for the formulation and recommendation of policies  and the approval of guidelines and programs governing the identification  analysis  measurement and control of material risks across state street 
chaired by the head of erm  the mrc focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives 
our capital committee  chaired by our chief financial officer  oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital  the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances 
alco  chaired by the treasurer  oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet  including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions 
the fiduciary review committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties  and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers 
the credit committee  chaired within erm  acts as the credit policy committee for state street 
the operational risk committee  chaired within erm  provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify  measure  manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across state street 
the model assessment committee  chaired within erm  provides recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates qualifying financial models utilized by our businesses 
several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the mrc 
corporate audit serves in a complementary role to our program of risk management  providing the board and management with continuous monitoring and control audits to assess adherence to state street s policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls 
additionally  the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts 
the corporate compliance  regulatory and industry affairs  and legal groups also serve essential roles in risk management 
corporate compliance is responsible for the design  implementation and oversight of policies  guidelines and programs to support our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever we conduct business 
the regulatory and industry affairs group monitors proposed changes in rules and legislation  and the legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments  maximize business opportunities and minimize legal  regulatory and other risks 
while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses  external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated 
market risk market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market driven factors and prices 
state street is exposed to market risk in both its 
table of contents trading and non trading  or asset and liability management  activities 
the market risk management processes related to these activities  discussed in further detail below  apply to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
we primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
the level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs  customer requirements and market volatility 
interest rate risk  a component of market risk  is more thoroughly discussed in the asset and liability management portion of this market risk section 
trading activities market risk associated with foreign exchange and other trading activities is managed through corporate guidelines  including established limits on aggregate and net open positions  sensitivity to changes in interest rates  and concentrations  which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds 
we use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies  including value at risk  to measure  monitor and manage market risk 
all limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers  the market risk management group and the trading and market risk committee 
we use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs  conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk 
these activities are designed to create trading revenue and to hedge potential earnings volatility 
in addition  we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets 
our customers use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities 
with the growth of cross border investing  customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios 
as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets  we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs 
as part of our trading activities  we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of these derivatives was billion  of which billion were foreign exchange forward and spot contracts 
in the aggregate  long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk 
all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates 
additional information about trading derivatives is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item as noted above  we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies  including value at risk  or var  which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval 
we use a risk measurement system to estimate var daily 
we have adopted standards for estimating var  and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines 
var is estimated for a one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than two years 
a one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated var more than of the time  or less than three business days out of a year 
the methodology uses a simulation approach based on historically observed changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates domestic and foreign and foreign exchange implied volatilities  and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions 
like all quantitative risk measures  var is subject to limitations and assumptions inherent in our methodology 
our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed 
the estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of trading positions held at the end of each business day 
therefore  implicit in the var estimate is the assumption that no intraday actions are taken by management during adverse market movements 
as a result  the methodology does not include risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility 

table of contents the following table presents var with respect to our trading activities  as measured by our var methodology for the periods indicated value at risk years ended december  in millions annual average maximum minimum annual average maximum minimum foreign exchange products interest rate products we back test the estimated one day var on a daily basis 
this information is reviewed and used to confirm that all relevant trading positions are properly modeled 
for the years ended december  and  we did not experience any actual trading losses in excess of our end of day var estimate 
asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue  or nir  under varying economic environments  while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
most of our nir is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses 
we structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities  but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines 
our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alco 
our global treasury group has responsibility for managing state street s day to day interest rate risk 
to effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related nir  global treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units  north america  europe and asia pacific  to reflect the growing  global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position 
our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk 
we invest in financial instruments with currency  repricing  and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position 
in addition to on balance sheet assets  we use certain derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities 
the use of derivatives is subject to alco approved guidelines 
additional information about our use of derivatives is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item as a result of growth in our non us operations  non us dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet 
this growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non us dollar yield curves  which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process 
because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates  we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values 
net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments 
we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates 
finally  gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re pricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position 

table of contents to measure  monitor  and report on our interest rate risk position  we use nir simulation  or nir at risk  which measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate  or rate shock  and gradual  or rate ramp  changes in market interest rates  and economic value of equity  or eve  which measures the impact on the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates 
nir at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on nir in the short term 
eve  on the other hand  is a long term view of interest rate risk  but with a view toward liquidation of state street 
both of these measures are subject to alco established guidelines  and are monitored regularly  along with other relevant simulations  scenario analyses and stress tests by both global treasury and alco 
in calculating our nir at risk  we start with a base amount of nir that is projected over the next twelve months  assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period 
our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months 
that yield curve is then shocked  or moved immediately  basis points in a parallel fashion  or at all points along the yield curve 
two new twelve month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions  but with the new yield curves  and compared to the base scenario 
we also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps  which are basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period  rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks 
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest 
the present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case 
we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values 
a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrower s prepayment opportunity 
key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows  the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities  especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities  changes in market conditions  and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely predict future nir or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nir and economic value 
actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions  changes in spreads and management strategies  among other factors 
projections of potential future streams of nir are assessed as part of our forecasting process 
the following table presents the estimated exposure of nir for the next twelve months  calculated as of december  and  due to an immediate basis point shift in then current interest rates 
estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on management s assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios  such as those previously discussed  and do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on state street s financial performance 
nir at risk estimated exposure to net interest revenue in millions rate change bps shock bps shock bps ramp bps ramp the nir at risk exposure to an immediate bp increase in market interest rates changed from negative at december  to slightly positive at december   while the nir at risk exposure to a bp downward shock in rates changed from slightly positive to significantly negative 
these changes were the result of two factors 
first  the level of on balance sheet liquid assets was increased during in response to the 
table of contents disruption in the financial markets  resulting in nir at risk exposures becoming more asset sensitive compared to second  with market interest rates and liability yields both well below at december   the downward bp shock produced balance sheet spread compression  as liability yields were prevented from repricing lower to the full extent of the rate shock 
with central bank administered interest rates worldwide already at historically low levels  however  we are positioned to benefit from rising interest rates going forward 
the year over year changes in nir at risk exposure to and bp ramps were directionally the same as for the bp shocks  with exposure to rising rates becoming less negative  and exposure to declining rates changing to negative  although the change was less pronounced due to the gradual shift in market rates inherent in the ramp scenarios 
other important factors that impact the levels of nir are balance sheet size and mix  interest rate spreads  the slope and interest rate level of us dollar and us dollar yield curves and the relationship between them  the pace of change in market interest rates  and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions 
the following table presents estimated eve exposures  calculated as of december  and december   assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates  the impact of which would be spread over a number of years 
economic value of equity estimated exposure to economic value of equity in millions rate change bps shock bps shock the eve results presented above indicate exposure to rising interest rates for both periods  although the magnitude of the exposure as of december  increased compared to december  in addition  the exposure to falling interest rates became negative at december  both of these changes reflect the significantly lower market interest rates at december  compared to december  the december  rate environment  with us interest rates near zero  prevents the downward bps shock from fully occurring  as market rates are not allowed to fall below zero  and reduces the benefit of lower rates on market value of the investment portfolio 
the increase in exposure for the rising rate scenario primarily reflects increased duration extension on mortgage backed securities in a rising rate environment relative to the base scenario  due to lower absolute levels of interest rates in the base scenario at december compared to december credit risk credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with contractual terms 
we assume credit and counterparty risk on both our on and off balance sheet exposures 
the extension of credit and the acceptance of counterparty risk by state street are governed by corporate guidelines based on the prospective customer s risk profile  the markets served  counterparty and country concentrations  and regulatory compliance 
our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk in a variety of forms 
we maintain comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake 
counterparties are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually  while significant exposures to counterparties are reviewed daily 
processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for all credit extensions 
as part of the approval and renewal process  due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure  as well as the quality of the counterparty 
we provide  on a limited basis  traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that is intended to enhance customer relationships  increase profitability and minimize risk 
we employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship 
this model is typical of financial institutions that provide credit to institutional customers in the markets that we serve 

table of contents an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio that can be estimated  and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy 
an internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss 
state street s risk rating process incorporates the use of risk rating tools informed by management s judgment 
qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a transparent and replicable manner  and following a formal review and approval process  an internal credit rating based on state street s credit scale is assigned 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio 
no provision for loan losses was recorded in  or at december  and  the allowance for loan losses was million 
changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows for the years ended december in millions us balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses loan charge offs commercial and financial recoveries commercial and financial reclassification balance at end of year us non us balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses reclassification balance at end of year non us total balance at end of year in  we reclassified million of the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as a reserve for off balance sheet commitments 
subsequent to the reclassification  the reserve for off balance sheet commitments was reduced by million  and recorded as an offset to other expenses 
we also reversed million through the provision for loan losses as a result of reduced credit risk exposures and improved credit quality 
past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over days delinquent  but where interest continues to be accrued 
an aggregate of approximately million of loans were past due as of december   composed of commercial real estate loans purchased from certain customers pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman brothers 
these loans continued to accrue interest  and no additional valuation adjustments or provisions for loss were recorded since their initial acquisition 
additional information about these loans is provided in the financial condition loans and lease financing section of this management s discussion and analysis 
there were no past due loans as of december    and we generally place loans on non accrual status once principal or interest payments are days past due  or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable 
loans days past due  but considered both well secured and in the process of collection  may be excluded from non accrual status 
for loans placed on non accrual status  revenue recognition is suspended 
there were no non accrual loans at year end    and we purchase securities under agreements to resell 
risk is managed through a variety of processes  including establishing the acceptability of counterparties  limiting purchases largely to low risk us government securities  taking possession or control of transaction assets  monitoring levels of underlying collateral  and limiting the duration of the agreements 
securities are revalued daily to determine if we believe that additional collateral is necessary from the borrower 
most repurchase agreements are short term  with maturities of less than days 
we also provide customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters of credit  lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements 
these exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis  with detailed approval and review processes 
these facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed annually 
we maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities 
management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis 

table of contents on behalf of our customers  we lend their securities to creditworthy banks  broker dealers and other institutions 
in most circumstances  we indemnify our customers for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
though these transactions are collateralized  the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit based underwriting and monitoring processes 
the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled billion at december   and billion at december  we require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
collateral received in connection with our securities lending services is held by us as agent and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
the securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
we held  as agent  cash and securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december  and  respectively 
the collateral held by us is invested on behalf of our customers 
in certain cases  the collateral is invested in third party repurchase agreements  for which we indemnify the customer against loss of the principal invested 
we require the repurchase agreement counterparty to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the amount of the repurchase agreement 
the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
of the collateral of billion at december  and billion at december  referenced above  billion at december  and billion at december  were invested in indemnified repurchase agreements 
we held  as agent  billion and billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements at december  and december   respectively 
processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for other credit extensions 
as part of the approval and renewal process  due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure  as well as the quality of the counterparty 
exposures to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by erm 
investments in debt and equity securities  including investments in affiliates  are monitored regularly by corporate finance and erm 
procedures are in place for evaluating potentially impaired securities  as discussed in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item operational risk we define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
as a leading provider of services to institutional investors  we conduct a broad array of complex and specialized asset servicing  processing and fiduciary activities that give rise to operational risk 
consequently  active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business 
our operational risk policy statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk 
the policy statement is reinforced by the operational risk guidelines  which codify our approach to operational risk 
the guidelines document our practices and provide a mandate within which programs  processes  and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified  measured  managed and controlled in a consistent manner across state street 
responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at state street 
we maintain an operational risk governance structure designed to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management 
the executive committee of the board sets operational risk policy and oversees implementation of the operational risk framework 
erm develops corporate programs to manage operational risk and oversees the overall operational risk program 
businesses own operational risk and periodically review the status of the business controls  which are designed to provide a sound operational environment 
the businesses also identify  manage  and report on operational risk 
the mrc and the operational risk committee review operational risk related information and policies  provide oversight designed to ensure compliance with the operational risk program  and escalate operational risk issues of note to the executive committee of the board 
corporate audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the examining and audit committee of the board 
our discipline in managing operational risk  which is a result of this emphasis on policy  guidelines  oversight  and independent review  provides the structure to identify  evaluate  control  monitor  measure  mitigate and report operational risk 

table of contents business risk we define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks  not already captured as market  interest rate  credit or operational risks 
we incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs 
active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at state street 
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risk is sometimes difficult 
for instance  the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss  while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss 
an additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition 
failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business  and the resultant inability to retain customers  would be classified as a business risk loss 
business risk is managed with a long term focus 
techniques include the development of business plans and appropriate management oversight 
the potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision 
we use a combination of historical earnings volatility  scenario analysis  stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to business risk 
management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we utilize three types of special purpose entities  referred to as spes 
one type of spe is utilized in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles 
since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these managed investment vehicles under existing accounting standards  we do not record these vehicles in our consolidated financial statements 
a second type of spe is utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment program  under which trusts structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax exempt investment grade assets to our mutual fund customers 
these trusts are recorded in our consolidated financial statements  since we treat the underlying transactions as secured borrowings  not as sales 
a third type of spe is utilized in connection with our asset backed commercial paper program  under which we administer four third party asset backed commercial paper conduits  which sell commercial paper to our institutional customers  primarily mutual fund customers  as short term investments 
since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these conduits under existing accounting standards  we do not record the conduits in our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about the activities of the above described spes is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item in the normal course of business  we hold assets under custody and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our customers  and  in accordance with gaap  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
similarly  collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent  therefore  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
additional information about these and other off balance sheet activities is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item in the normal course of business  we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs  to conduct trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk
