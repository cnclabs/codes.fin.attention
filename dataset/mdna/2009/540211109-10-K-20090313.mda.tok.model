executive overview to balance our business and operations as economic conditions deteriorated in and better position the company for additional challenges in  we implemented numerous changes to our operations in the last half of to right size our operations to the evolving economic conditions 
these changes included substantially reducing the amount of capital we allocated to our investment activities  as well as reducing the cost of our operations by reducing the size of our employee base  freezing wage levels  eliminating the company k match  suspending the annual bonus program and reduced a variety of other operating expenses 
this proactive management approach  as well as the continued expansion of strategic growth initiatives which focus on non guest entertainment revenue  generated an increase in adjusted net free cash flow  from million in to million in  and allowed us to accelerate the reduction of our outstanding debt 
during  we made optional payments of million against the term b portion of our credit facility  in addition to the required payments of million 
pending a rebound in the travel and lodging industry  we will continue to take a conservative approach to operating expenses and capital expenditures 
we are committed to reducing our debt and continue to take actions to remain in compliance with debt covenants throughout our total revenue for was million  an increase of million or  compared to the increase in revenue was attributed to increases in guest entertainment and hotel services revenue  primarily related to the acquisitions of on command and stayonline  and an increase in revenue from system sales and related services

hospitality guest entertainment includes purchases for on demand movies  network based video games  music and music videos  and television on demand programming 
our primary source of revenue is providing in room  interactive guest entertainment  for which the hotel guest pays on a per view  hourly or daily basis 
our total guest generated revenue depends on a number of factors  including the number of rooms on our network 
we can increase revenue over time by increasing the number of rooms served by our interactive television systems 
our ability to expand our room base is dependent on a number of factors  including newly constructed hotel properties and the attractiveness of our technology  service and support to hotels currently operating without an interactive television system 
the popularity  timeliness and amount of content offered at the hotel 
our revenues vary  to a certain degree  with the number  timeliness and popularity of movie content available for viewing 
historically  a decrease in the availability of popular movie content has adversely impacted revenue 
although not completely within our control  we seek to program and promote the most popular available movie content and other content to maximize revenue and profitability 
the price of the service purchased by the hotel guest 
generally  we control the prices charged for our products and services and manage pricing in an effort to maximize revenue and overall profitability 
we establish pricing based on such things as the demographics of the property served  the popularity of the content and overall general economic conditions 
our technology enables us to measure the popularity of our content and make decisions to best position such content and optimize revenue from such content 
the occupancy rate at the property 
our revenue also varies depending on hotel occupancy rates  which are subject to a number of factors  including seasonality  general economic conditions and world events  such as terrorist threats or public health issues 
occupancy rates for the properties we serve are typically higher during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns 
we target higher occupancy properties in diverse demographic and geographic locations in an effort to mitigate occupancy related risks 

table of contents the availability of alternative programming 
we compete directly for customers with a variety of other interactive service providers  including other interactive television service providers  cable television companies  direct broadcast satellite companies  television networks and programmers  internet service providers and portals  companies offering web sites which provide on demand movies  rental companies which provide videocassettes and dvds which can be viewed in properly equipped hotel rooms or on other portable viewing devices  and hotels which offer in room laptops with internet access or other types of internet access systems 
we also compete  in varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  personal computers and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
consumer sentiment 
the willingness of guests to purchase our entertainment services is also impacted by the general economic environment and its impact on consumer sentiment 
historically  such impacts were not generally material to our revenue results  however  during the last two quarter of  the deteriorating economic conditions did have a significant  negative impact on our revenue levels 
as economic conditions improve in the future  guest purchase activity may increase to levels previously experienced by the company 
the primary direct costs of providing guest entertainment are license fees paid to major motion picture studios  which are variable and based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for non exclusive distribution rights of recently released major motion pictures  commissions paid to our hotel customers  which are also variable and based on a percent of guest generated revenue  license fees  which are based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for television on demand  music  music videos  video games and sports programming  and one time license fees paid for independent films  most of which are non rated and intended for mature audiences 
hotel services includes revenue from hotels for services such as television channels and recurring broadband internet service and support to the hotels 
another major source of our revenue is providing cable television programming and internet services to the lodging industry  for which the hotel pays a fixed monthly fee 
cable television programming 
we offer a wide variety of satellite delivered cable television programming paid for by the hotel and provided to guests at no charge 
the cable television programming is delivered via satellite  pursuant to an agreement with directv  and distributed to approximately of our guest rooms over the internal hotel network  and typically includes premium channels such as hbo  showtime and the disney channel  which broadcast major motion pictures and specialty programming  as well as non premium channels  such as cnn and espn 
with the launch of the high definition configuration of our interactive television system  we also began offering high definition cable television programming to the extent available from broadcast sources and directv 
broadband internet access  service and support 
we also design  install and operate wired and wireless broadband internet access systems at hotel properties 
these systems control access to the internet  allow hotels to charge or provide the access as a guest amenity  and provide bandwidth management tools 
post installation  we generate recurring revenue through the ongoing maintenance  service and call center support services to hotel properties installed by us and also to hotel properties installed by other providers 
while this is a highly competitive area  we believe we have important advantages as a result of our existing hotel customer relationships  our nationwide field service network  and a hour call center to support calls from hotel customers 
system sales and related services 
we also generate revenue from other products and services within the hotel and lodging industry  including sales of internet access and other interactive television systems and equipment  internet conference services  and professional design  project management and installation services 

table of contents key metrics special note regarding the use of non gaap financial information to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we use net free cash flow  a non gaap measure derived from results based on gaap 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered superior to  in isolation of  or as a substitute for  results prepared in accordance with gaap 
we define net free cash flow  a non gaap measure  as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for certain investing activities and consideration paid for acquisitions 
net free cash flow is a key liquidity measure but should not be construed as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of our profitability or performance 
we provide information about net free cash flow because we believe it is a useful way for us  and our investors  to measure our ability to satisfy cash needs  including interest payments on our debt  taxes and capital expenditures 
gaap requires us to provide information about cash flow generated from operations 
however  gaap cash flow from operations is reduced by the amount of interest and tax payments and also takes into account changes in net current liabilities eg  changes in working capital which do not impact net income 
because changes in working capital can reverse in subsequent periods  and because we want to provide information about cash available to satisfy interest and income tax expense by showing our cash flows before deducting interest and income tax expense  we are also presenting net free cash flow information 
our definition of net free cash flow does not take into account our working capital requirements  debt service requirements or other commitments 
accordingly  net free cash flow is not necessarily indicative of amounts of cash which may be available to us for discretionary purposes 
our method of computing net free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
rooms served one of the metrics we monitor within our hospitality business is the growth  net of de installations  of the number of rooms we serve for our various services 
as of december  we had the following number of rooms installed with the designated service total rooms served total guest entertainment rooms total cable television programming ftg rooms total advertising and media services rooms total broadband internet rooms net new guest entertainment rooms total rooms served include rooms receiving one or more of our services  including rooms served by international licensees 
the increase from to is due to the addition of the on command room base of approximately  rooms 
guest entertainment rooms are equipped with our interactive television systems 
cable television programming ftg rooms receive basic or premium television programming 
includes rooms receiving satellite delivered and server based channels 
represents rooms receiving high speed internet service and are included in total rooms served 
amounts shown are net of de installations during the period 
the gross number of new rooms installed was   and  for  and  respectively 

table of contents high definition room growth we also track the increasing penetration of our high definition television hdtv system  since rooms equipped with hdtv services typically generate higher revenue from guest entertainment and hotel services than rooms equipped with our other vod systems 
hdtv room growth is occurring as we install our hdtv system in newly contracted rooms and convert select rooms to the hdtv system in exchange for long term contract extensions 
we installed our systems in the following number of net new rooms and had the following total rooms installed as of december net new hdtv rooms total hdtv rooms installed hdtv rooms as a percent of total guest entertainment rooms hdtv rooms  including new installations and major upgrades  are equipped with high definition capabilities 
capital investment per vod room the average investment per room associated with an installation can fluctuate due to the type of interactive television system installed  engineering efforts  component costs  product segmentation  cost of assembly and installation  average property size  certain fixed costs and hotel capital contributions 
the following table sets forth our average installation and conversion investment cost per room on a comparable room base during the years ended december average cost per room new installation average cost per room conversion average cost per hd room new installation average cost per hd room conversion the decrease in the average cost per new and converted hd rooms from to was primarily driven by the change in average room size of the property  engineering efforts and hotel capital contributions 
the increase in the average cost per new room from to was primarily driven by the decrease in average number of rooms per property and the increase in high definition installations  which have a higher equipment cost per room 
average revenue per room we closely monitor the revenue we generate per average hospitality room 
guest entertainment revenue can fluctuate based on several factors including occupancy  the popularity of movie content  consumer sentiment  the mix of services purchased  mix of travelers  the availability of alternative programming and the overall economic environment 
during  occupancy rates were lower than levels 
hotel services revenue can fluctuate based on the percentage of our hotels purchasing cable television programming services from us  the type of services provided at each site as well as the number of hotels purchasing broadband service and support from us 
system sales and related services revenue can fluctuate based on the number of system and equipment sales  including broadband systems sales 
the following table sets forth the components of our hospitality revenue per room for the years ended december 
table of contents average monthly revenue per room hospitality guest entertainment hotel services system sales and related services total hospitality revenue per room certain contracts within our acquired on command customer base included substantial discounts for satellite delivered basic and premium television programming  which negatively impacted hotel services revenue 
we expect to eliminate these discounts as these sites are upgraded to high definition television capabilities 
direct costs guest entertainment direct costs vary based on content license fees  the mix of guest entertainment products purchased and the commission earned by the hotel 
hotel services direct costs include the cost of cable television programming and the cost of broadband internet support services 
the cost of system sales and related services primarily includes the cost of the systems and equipment sold to hotels 
the overall direct cost margin primarily varies based on the composition of revenue

advertising we deliver advertising supported media into select hotel segments from which we earn revenue from the sale of television commercials or other marketing based programs 
the demographic and professional profile of the traveler within our room base tends to have characteristics we believe may be attractive to consumer marketing organizations 
by approaching guests with relevant messaging when they are in the comfort of a hotel room  free of distractions  advertisers have a prime opportunity to capture the attention of and connect with these desired consumers

net free cash flow one of our goals is to increase the level of net free cash flow we generate 
we manage our net free cash flow by seeking to maximize the amount of cash we generate from our operations and then allocating a certain percentage of cash from operations to our investing activities 
we can manage capital expenditures by reducing the per room installation cost of a room and by varying the number of rooms we install in any given period 
levels of net free cash flow are set forth in the following table dollar amounts in thousands cash provided by operating activities property and equipment additions cash used for acquisitions and other activities cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  included million of cash used for integration  restructuring and reorganization related activities

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash from operations  our cash on hand and the million revolver portion of our credit facility  which matures in we believe that by managing our investing activities  our cash on hand  operating cash flow and borrowing available under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund our business and comply with our financing obligations 
during  we plan to allocate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of debt and use the balance of the cash flow for capital expenditures 
as of december   working capital was million  compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the million optional payments on the term b portion of the credit facility during the collectability of our receivables is reasonably assured as supported by our broad customer base 
our interactive hotel base is well diversified in terms of i location  ii demographics  and iii customer contracts 
we provide our services to various hotel chains  ownership groups and management companies 
in accordance with our hotel contracts  monies collected by the hotel for interactive television services are held in trust on our behalf  thereby limiting our risk from hotel bankruptcies 
in order to fund our acquisitions of on command and stayonline  in april we entered into a million bank credit facility  comprised of a million term loan  which matures in april  and a million revolving credit facility  which matures in april the term loan requires a quarterly repayment of  which began september  the term loan bears interest at our option of the bank s base rate plus a margin of or libor plus a margin of 
the agreement provides that when the consolidated leverage ratio is below times  the term loan bears interest at our option of the bank s base rate plus a margin of or libor plus a margin of 
the term loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit facility includes terms and conditions which require compliance with the leverage and interest coverage covenants 
the credit agreement also requires that we notify the agent upon the occurrence of a material adverse effect or prior to any draw on the company s revolving credit facility  as such terms are defined and used within our bank credit facility 
however  under the credit agreement  the provision of such a notice is not an event of default but if such an event occurred  it could restrict the company s ability to obtain additional financing under the revolving credit facility 
the credit facility also stipulates we enter into hedge agreements to provide at least of the outstanding term loan into a fixed interest rate for a period not less than two years 
we have entered into fixed rate swap agreements for of the outstanding term loan at an average interest rate of

maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratios are defined terms of the bank credit facility and are presented here to demonstrate compliance with the covenants in our credit facility  as noncompliance with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not utilize special purpose entities or off balance sheet financial arrangements 
our future debt covenant ratios will change as follows q q q q to maturity maximum consolidated leverage ratio minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio 
table of contents in order to continue to efficiently operate and expand our business  we must remain in compliance with covenants outlined in our credit facility 
our ability to remain in compliance with those covenants will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations and manage our level of capital investment 
to some extent  this is subject to general economic climate and business conditions beyond our control 
the actions within our control include our prudent management of capital investment  operating costs and exploring other alternatives  which may include seeking an amendment to our credit facility  wage reductions  reduced service hours or other reductions to the workforce 
we believe we are balancing the interest of our customers and our company by reducing our capital investments  reducing our cost structure and aggressively reducing the level of debt 
during the fourth quarter of  as part of our debt reduction initiative  we acquired  through a wholly owned subsidiary as a permitted investment under our credit facility  million of outstanding debt at of par value and recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
during january of  we acquired an additional million of outstanding debt at an average of of par value 
under our credit facility  we can make permitted investments  as defined by the credit facility  of up to million 
we are committed to reducing our debt and are taking actions to remain in compliance with debt covenants 
though we expect to meet all debt covenants during  our ability to comply with these covenants depends on achieving our planned operating results  including further debt reductions 
given the economic uncertainties impacting travel and lodging  constraints in the credit markets  consumer conservatism and other market dynamics  we cannot be assured of meeting our planned results and the required covenants 
if we are not able to remain in compliance with the debt covenants  it may have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition and we may need to amend the credit facility or seek a waiver of the covenants 
if a waiver or other relief is not granted  an amendment to the credit facility may significantly increase our interest costs  add upfront fees and other terms less favorable to us than currently in our credit agreement 
in the event our lenders will not amend or waive the covenants  the debt would be due and we would need to seek alternative financing 
we cannot provide assurance we would be able to obtain alternative financing 
if we were not able to secure alternative financing  this would have a material adverse impact on the company 
the credit agreement also requires that we notify the agent upon the occurrence of a material adverse effect or prior to any draw on the company s revolving credit facility  as such terms are defined and used within our bank credit facility 
however  under the credit agreement  the provision of such a notice is not an event of default but if such an event occurred  it could restrict the company s ability to obtain additional financing under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we are not aware of any events which would qualify under the material adverse effect under the credit facility 
the total amount of long term debt outstanding  including the current portion  as of december  was million versus million as of december  in april  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional values of million  at a rate of  and million  at a rate of  both of which expire in june in addition  we entered into a million notional amount swap in november  at a rate of  which expires in december these swap arrangements effectively change the underlying debt from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the term of the swap agreements

in connection with our programming related agreements  we may guarantee minimum royalties for specific periods or by individual programming content 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation depending upon hotel occupancy rates and other factors including travel pattern and the economy 
our hotel customers typically experience higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns and  accordingly  we historically have higher revenue in those quarters 
however  quarterly revenue can be affected by the availability of popular content during those quarters and by consumer purchasing behavior 
we have no control over when new content is released or how popular it will be  or the effect of economic conditions on consumer behavior 

table of contents market conditions due to the current market conditions  our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the lodging industry s performance 
our results are closely connected to the performance of the lodging industry  where occupancy rates may fluctuate resulting from various factors 
the percentage of occupied rooms that buy movies and other services at the property also varies over time with general economic conditions  including but not limited to consumer sentiment  and other factors 
reduction in hotel occupancy resulting from the general economic environment or other changes in market conditions  such as a recession or significant slow down in economic activity  or significant international crises  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the overall travel industry can be  and has been in the past  adversely affected by weaker general economic climates  geopolitical instability and concerns about public health 
factors such as the cost of fuel  airline fares  and other economic conditions that result in a decrease in business or leisure travel can all effect hotel occupancy and the demand for some of our products and services 
also  our goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired if the market conditions remain weak over the next six to twelve months 
other market risk factors are included in part i  item a risk factors

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our primary cost drivers are predetermined rates  such as hotel commissions  license fees paid for major motion pictures and other content  or one time fixed fees for independent films 
however  the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable based upon the available information 
the critical policies related to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are further discussed within the notes of the financial statements as follows revenue recognition footnote goodwill and intangibles footnote restructuring footnote recent accounting developments we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions for financial assets and financial liabilities of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements  on january  sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
does not expand or require any new fair value measures  however  the application of this statement may change current practice 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  deferring the effective date of the recognition and disclosure provisions for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities of sfas no 
 and decided an entity need not apply this standard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities which are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until we did not adopt sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis and accordingly  our adoption of this standard in was limited to financial assets and liabilities  which primarily affects the valuation disclosure of our debt and derivative contracts 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are in the process of evaluating this standard with respect to its effect on nonfinancial assets and liabilities and therefore have not yet determined the impact it will have on our financial statements upon full adoption in nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of sfas no 
include those measured at fair value in impairment testing and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination 
we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 on january  sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
entities which elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis  with few exceptions 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies which choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations as we did not elect this fair value option 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
this standard significantly changes the framework related to accounting for business combinations and requires a substantial amount of new disclosures 
this standard is effective for acquisitions in annual periods beginning on or after december   early adoption is prohibited 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on how we would identify  negotiate and value any future acquisitions and a material impact on how a future acquisition would affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
the new standard requires additional disclosures regarding a company s derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format 
it also requires disclosure of derivative features which are credit risk related as well as cross referencing within the notes to the financial statements to enable financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments  financial performance  and cash flows 
the standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we are currently evaluating the disclosure requirements related to sfas no 
and expect the adoption will not have significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp no 
amends the factors which should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of fsp no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fsp fas and fin  disclosures about credit derivatives and certain guarantees an amendment of fasb statement no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 and clarification of the effective date of fasb statement no 
this fsp applies to a credit derivatives within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  b hybrid instruments which have embedded credit derivatives  and c guarantees within the scope of fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this fsp amends sfas no 
 to require disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives  including credit derivatives embedded in a hybrid instrument 
this fsp also amends fin  to require an additional disclosure about the current status of the payment performance risk of a guarantee 
in addition  this fsp clarifies the fasb s intent which the disclosures required by sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  should be provided for any reporting period annual or interim beginning after november  the provisions of this fsp which amend sfas no 
and fin are effective for reporting periods annual or interim ending after november  earlier adoption is encouraged for the provisions which amend sfas no 
and fin the clarification of the effective date of sfas no 
is effective september  we do not expect the adoption of this fsp to impact our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp no 
clarifies the application of sfas no 
 which we adopted as of january   in cases where a market is not active 
the fsp is effective october   and for prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
we have considered fsp no 
in our determination of estimated fair values as of december   and the impact was not material 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including potential losses resulting from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

table of contents interest 
at december   we had debt totaling million  with a weighted average interest rate as follows dollar amounts in thousands carrying fair weighted average amount value interest rate bank credit facility bank term loan capital leases the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on current rates for similar debt of the same remaining maturities and quoted market prices  except for capital leases  which are reported at carrying value 
in addition  the fair value of our long term debt is strictly hypothetical and not indicative of what we are required to pay under the terms of our debt instruments 
we have three interest rate swap agreements  with notional values of million  at a rate of  and million  at a rate of  both of which expire in june and a swap agreement having a million notional amount swap  at a rate of  which expires in december including the interest rate swap arrangements  our all in weighted average interest rate as of december  was 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap arrangements  we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million at december  for fixed rate debt  interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows  if effective 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the impact on earnings and cash flow for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase to interest rates would be approximately  assuming other variables remain constant 
economic condition 
our results are closely connected to the performance of the lodging industry  where occupancy rates may fluctuate resulting from various factors 
reduction in hotel occupancy resulting from business  general economic  or other events  such as a recession in the united states  significant international crises  acts of terrorism  war or public health issues  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the overall travel industry can be  and has been in the past  adversely affected by weaker general economic climates  geopolitical instability and concerns about public health 
foreign currency transactions 
a portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of guest entertainment services in canada and mexico 
the results of operations and financial position of our operations in canada and mexico are measured in their local currencies and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in canada and mexico are somewhat mitigated by the fact expenses and liabilities are generally incurred in the local currency 
the reported income of our canadian and mexican subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency 
additionally  a portion of our assets are based in canada and mexico and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period 
accordingly  our consolidated assets will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency
