item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics that harness the immune system to fight cancer 
our portfolio includes active immunotherapy  monoclonal antibody and small molecule product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers 
our most advanced product candidate is provenge sipuleucel t  an active cellular immunotherapy for prostate cancer 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  contract manufacturing expenses and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and research efforts 
we anticipate incurring net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our technology  expand our operations and develop the infrastructure 
table of contents to support the commercialization of provenge and other product candidates we may develop 
the majority of our resources continue to be used in support of provenge 
we own worldwide commercialization rights for provenge 
we will not generate revenue from the sale of our potential commercial therapeutic products in the us until provenge or another product candidate we may develop is approved by the us food and drug administration the fda 
without revenue generated from commercial sales  we anticipate that we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations from our available cash resources and future offerings of equity  debt or other securities 
in september  we announced plans to submit our biologics license application our bla to the fda for approval to market provenge 
this decision followed a pre bla meeting in which we reviewed safety and efficacy data with the fda from our two completed phase clinical trials for provenge  d and da 
in these discussions the fda agreed that the survival benefit observed in the d study in conjunction with the supportive data obtained from study da and the absence of significant toxicity in both studies was sufficient to serve as the clinical basis of our bla submission for provenge 
provenge was granted fast track designation from the fda for the treatment of asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent also known as hormone refractory prostate cancer patients  which enabled us to submit our bla on a rolling basis 
on august   we submitted the clinical and non clinical sections of our bla and on november   we submitted the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc section  completing our submission of our bla to the fda for provenge 
on january   the fda accepted our bla filing and assigned priority review status for provenge 
the fda s cellular  tissue and gene therapies advisory committee the advisory committee review of our bla for the use of provenge in the treatment of patients with asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent prostate cancer was held on march  the advisory committee was unanimous yes  no in its opinion that the submitted data established that provenge is reasonably safe for the intended population and the majority yes  no believed that the submitted data provided substantial evidence of the efficacy of provenge in the intended population 
on may   we received a complete response letter from the fda regarding our bla 
in its letter  the fda requested additional clinical data in support of the efficacy claim contained in the bla  as well as additional information with respect to the cmc section of the bla 
in a meeting with the fda on may   we received confirmation that the fda will accept a positive interim or final analysis of survival from our ongoing phase db impact immunotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment study to support licensure of provenge 
these analyses are event driven  rather than time specific 
on october   we announced the receipt of interim results from our impact study 
the independent data monitoring committee the idmc reported to us a percent reduction in the risk of death in the provenge arm of the study relative to placebo 
the idmc observed no safety concerns and recommended that the study continue to its final analysis  which is anticipated by the end of april if the study demonstrates approximately a percent reduction in the risk of death  based on events  we would expect the study to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival 
in such event  we believe these data would be sufficient to address the fda s request for additional clinical information to support the proposed efficacy claim and we would amend our bla 
we would also expect to increase our investments in commercial infrastructure in preparation for the possible approval of provenge 
the level of increased investment would depend on our ability to access additional financing  either through the capital markets  borrowings or through partnership opportunities with provenge 
the impact study may not meet the prespecified statistical criteria  but still provide additional supportive evidence of efficacy to support amending our bla 
the decision to amend the bla will be based on several factors  including the totality of the data from our three phase studies and whether such data demonstrate a favorable benefit to risk profile for patients with asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent prostate cancer 
if the impact study fails to provide sufficient positive evidence of survival to allow us to amend on bla we expect to focus our efforts on the trpm clinical program and explore potential business development opportunities 
other potential product candidates we have under development include neuvenge tm  our investigational active cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with breast  ovarian and other solid tumors expressing her 
table of contents neu 
we are also developing an orally available small molecule targeting trpm that could be applicable to multiple types of cancer as well as benign prostatic hyperplasia 
in december we filed an investigational new drug application ind to investigate this small molecule in advanced cancer patients 
the ind was cleared by the fda in january critical accounting policies and estimates we make judgmental decisions and estimates with underlying assumptions when applying accounting principles to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are detailed below 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes to the estimate or different estimates  that could have reasonably been used  would have materially changed our consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  should our actual experience differ from these assumptions and other considerations used in estimating these amounts  the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of the revenue we receive is collaborative research revenue and license revenue 
we recognize collaborative research revenues from up front payments  milestone payments  and personnel supported research funding 
we also recognize license revenue from intellectual property and technology agreements 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are generally contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
license fees license fees from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which we have continuing obligations  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  an estimate is made of the time required to achieve that goal considering experience with similar projects  level of effort and the development stage of the project 
the basis of the revenue recognition is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  collectability is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
royalty income royalties from licensees are based on reported sales of licensed products  and revenues are calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
research and development expenses we account for research and development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research 
table of contents and development activities eitf 
for research and development activities in progress at january   costs are expensed as incurred including nonrefundable prepayments for research and development services 
on january   we adopted eitf and changed our accounting policy 
for new contracts entered into as of or subsequent to january   nonrefundable prepayments for research and development services are deferred and recognized as the services are rendered 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  facilities and related overhead costs 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we grant restricted stock awards that generally vest over a four year period  however  in and  we granted restricted stock awards with certain performance conditions to all employees 
in accordance with sfas r  management is required to estimate the probability of achieving each acceleration provision 
compensation expense is recorded based upon our assessment of accomplishing each provision 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock based payment awards on the accelerated method over the requisite service period of the entire award  unless the awards are subject to other conditions  in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche 
we determine the grant date fair value of our stock option awards and employee stock purchase plan under sfas r using the bsm option pricing model 
for additional information about stock based compensation  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted eitf issue and changed our accounting policy

results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue revenue was  in   in and  in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to decreased revenue related to the sale of certain intellectual property in our revenue in also includes recognition of deferred revenue related to one license agreement 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to revenue related to an intellectual property option purchase agreement entered into in with wilex ag wilex and exercised in for payment to us of  as further described below 
our revenue in and also includes recognition of deferred revenue related to two license agreements 
on february   we entered into an option purchase agreement with wilex for our intellectual property in small molecule inhibitors of urokinase plasminogen activator u pa 
on march   wilex exercised its option pursuant to the terms and conditions of the option agreement in exchange for payment to us of  the sale of this technology is a perpetual exclusive arrangement where we have assigned our entire right  title and interest in the intellectual property to wilex 
furthermore  upon exercising its option  wilex is obligated to make additional milestone payments to us upon the occurrence of future events  which includes initiation of the first clinical phase ii and phase iii studies resulting from a product developed from the intellectual property and upon the first sale of this product after an approval from the fda 
these milestone payments are capped at million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease compared with was primarily due to decreased phase clinical activities as a result of the completion of patient enrollment in the impact trial in late  the completion and utilization of our morris plains  new jersey manufacturing facility the facility and resultant reduction of outside clinical manufacturing  the purchase of commercial antigen in  the reduction in the costs for pre commercialization efforts of provenge and the decrease in headcount and related severance costs associated with the reduction in force 
the increase compared with was primarily due to the purchase of commercial antigen in and increased costs associated with our facility  offset by decreased phase clinical activities as a result of the completion of patient enrollment in the impact trial in late financial data from our research and development related activities is compiled and managed by us as follows clinical programs  and discovery research 

table of contents our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions clinical programs direct costs indirect costs total clinical programs discovery research total research and development expense direct research and development costs associated with our clinical programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical program include wages  payroll taxes and other employee related expenses  rent  restructuring charges  stock based compensation  utilities and other facilities related maintenance 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
costs attributable to our discovery research programs represent our efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline 
while we believe our clinical programs are promising  we do not know whether any commercially viable products will result from our research and development efforts 
due to the unpredictable nature of scientific research and product development  we cannot reasonably estimate the timeframe over which our projects are likely to be completed  whether they will be completed  if they are completed  whether they will provide therapeutic benefit or be approved for commercialization by the necessary regulatory agencies  or whether  if approved  they will be scalable to meet commercial demand 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were primarily comprised of salaries and wages  consulting fees  marketing fees and administrative costs to support our operations 
the decrease in compared with was primarily attributable to decreased outside services and marketing costs related to pre commercialization efforts for provenge  decreased headcount and severance costs associated with the reduction in force and decreased legal fees associated with our current legal proceedings 
the increase in compared with was primarily attributable to increased legal fees associated with our current legal proceedings  increased non cash stock compensation and increased administrative costs offset by decreased consulting costs associated with the validation of our enterprise resource planning system in interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash and investment balances 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher average interest rates and a higher average cash balance due to the proceeds from the issue in june and july of an aggregate of million in convertible senior subordinated notes the notes 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and  in the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance in  including the principal amount of the notes as 
table of contents compared to  offset by capitalized interest expense related to the construction of the facility and our product scheduling system and by decreased interest expense related to debt and capital lease obligations 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the average debt balance in  including the principal amount of the notes  as compared to  and the capitalization of interest costs related to the construction of the facility 
warrant liability non operating income associated with the decrease in warrant liability was  for the year ended december  this represents the decrease in the initial fair value of million of the warrants from the date of issuance  april under sfas  the warrants were determined to be level liability  as such the fair value was calculated using the black scholes merton option pricing model and is remeasured at each reporting period 
potential future increases in our stock price will result in losses being recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in future periods 
conversely  potential future declines in our stock price will result in gains being recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in future periods 
neither of these potential gains or losses will have any impact on our cash balance  liquidity or cash flows from operations 
income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards r d credits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the nols and r d credits expire at various dates  beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the nols and r d credits may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of nols and r d credits before utilization 
stock based compensation expense total stock based employee compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in  and was million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  were included in research and development expense and million  million and million  respectively  were included in general and administrative expense 
total stock based employee compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in  and increased our net loss per share by  and  respectively 
as we use a full valuation allowance with respect to deferred taxes  the adoption of sfas r had no impact on deferred taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash uses and proceeds as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities  including the notes  cash receipts from collaborative agreements  and interest income earned 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures in all periods were a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  contract manufacturing costs and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
in  these expenditures were partially offset by cash received from our corporate collaborators  including license fees from kirin brewing co  ltd 
of million 
since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
at december   our aggregate investment in equipment and leasehold improvements was million 
as of december   we anticipate that our cash on hand  including our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months  provided  however  that if we receive positive survival results from the final analysis for the impact 
table of contents trial and therefore commence activities in anticipation of the approval of provenge for commercialization  we will need to raise additional funds for  among other things the development of marketing  manufacturing  information technology and other infrastructure and activities related to the commercialization of provenge  working capital needs  expanding the our manufacturing capabilities  increased personnel needs  and continuing our internal research and development programs 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds through sales of common stock or debt securities  borrowings  partnership opportunities for provenge  or otherwise  should we need them  we may be required to delay our commercialization efforts for provenge 
leases and credit facility on march   we entered into the second amendment to our office lease agreement with selig holdings company  llc 
the amendment extends the term on our headquarters to december  on august   we entered into the third amendment to our lease agreement with are first avenue  llc 
the amendment extends the lease on our principal research  development and administrative facilities in seattle  washington that consist of approximately  square feet to december   with option to extend the term for an additional five years 
the annual base rent for the extended lease term is approximately million  which is to be increased annually between three to six percent  approximating the seattle area consumer price index 
on august   we entered into an agreement to lease  square feet of commercial manufacturing space in morris plains  new jersey 
the lease term is seven years  and we have the option to extend the lease for two ten year periods and one five year period  with the same terms and conditions except for rent  which adjusts upon renewal to market rate 
we intend to outfit the facility in phases to meet the anticipated clinical and commercial manufacturing needs for provenge and our other immunotherapy product candidates in development 
the initial phase of the build out of the facility was completed in july in february  we started to manufacture provenge for clinical use in the facility 
the lease required us to provide the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of million as a security deposit 
we provided wells fargo  the bank that issued the letter of credit on our behalf  a security deposit of million to guarantee the letter of credit  which was recorded as long term restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet upon issuance 
during  the letter of credit was reduced to million and the collateral amount required by wells fargo was reduced commensurately  resulting in a release of restricted cash of million 
the million letter of credit was recorded as long term restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in december  we entered into the first two of a series of anticipated promissory notes the ge notes  with general electric capital corporation ge capital  for the purchase of equipment and associated build out costs for the facility 
the ge notes  which evidence one loan with an original principal amount of million bearing interest at percent per year that was paid in full at december   and the remaining loans with original principal amounts totaling million and an average interest rate of percent  are to be repaid in consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest 
the ge notes are secured by a master security agreement the security agreement  and two security deposit pledge agreements the pledge agreements 
pursuant to the pledge agreements  we deposited an aggregate of million as a security deposit for the repayment of the ge notes  which will be released upon the repayment of the ge notes or upon receipt of fda approval for the commercialization of provenge 
the balance of such security deposit as of december  was million 
the security deposit is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in short term restricted cash 
there is a material adverse change clause in the security agreement which may accelerate the maturity of the ge notes upon the occurrence of certain events 
we do not believe a material adverse change in our financial condition has occurred 
the balance due on the ge notes as of december  was approximately million 

table of contents financings from the sale of securities and issuance of convertible notes equity offering proceeds we have received net proceeds of million from the sale of equity securities through a public offering  registered direct offerings and our equity line arrangement since january  in november  we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million  or million  net of underwriting fees  commissions and other offering costs 
in april  we received net proceeds of million from our issuance of million shares of our common stock  and warrants to purchase up to million shares of common stock and warrants to an single investor

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy  which specifies credit quality standards  limits our credit exposure to any single issuer and defines allowable investments 
auction rate or asset backed securities without a guarantee by the us government are not permitted to be purchased 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively and long term investments of million and million  respectively 
our short term and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
the estimated fair value of our short term and long term investments at december   assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  would decrease by  which would not materially impact our operations 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be an other than temporary impairment 
we proactively monitor and manage our portfolio 
if necessary we believe we are able to liquidate our investments within the next year without significant loss 
we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the government and major corporate guarantees of the underlying securities  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes to realize our investments recorded values 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
we limit our exposure to adjustable interest rates on our debt financings by capping the interest rate at a fixed amount
