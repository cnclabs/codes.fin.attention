item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition matrix service records profits on fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated contract cost 
matrix service records revenue on reimbursable and time and material contracts on a proportional performance basis as costs are incurred 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
matrix service includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment and subcontractor costs  when matrix service determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components on behalf of the customer 
matrix service has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
matrix service has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs  and accordingly  does not believe significant fluctuations are likely to materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete fixed price contracts indicate a loss  a provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
a number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts 
adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded in the period on a percentage of completion basis when estimable and probable 
indirect costs such as salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs and insurance costs are charged to projects based upon direct labor hours and overhead allocation rates per direct labor hour 
warranty costs are normally incurred prior to project completion and are charged to project costs as they are incurred 
warranty costs incurred subsequent to project completion were not material for the periods presented 
overhead allocation rates are established annually during the budgeting process and evaluated for accuracy throughout the year based upon actual direct labor hours and actual costs incurred 
claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract 
table of contents terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of anticipated additional costs incurred by us 
recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
we must determine if there is a legal basis for the claim  the additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen by the company and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  the costs are identifiable or determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
if all of these requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded only to the extent that we have incurred costs relating to the claim 
as of may  and may   costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues for unapproved change orders of million and million  respectively 
there were no claims included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts as of may  or may  historically  our collections for unapproved change orders and other claims have approximated the amount of revenue recognized 
loss contingencies various legal actions  claims  and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or are otherwise disclosed  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we use a case by case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known 
we believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles  coverage limits and self insured retentions 
as of may  and  insurance reserves totaling million and million  respectively  are included on our balance sheet 
these amounts represent our best estimate of our ultimate obligations for asserted claims  insurance premium obligations  and claims incurred but not yet reported at the balance sheet dates 
we establish reserves for claims using a combination of actuarially determined estimates and a case by case evaluation of the underlying claim data and update our evaluations as further information becomes known 
judgments and assumptions are inherent in our reserve accruals  as a result  changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in changes to these estimates in the future 
additionally  the actual results of claim settlements could differ from the amounts estimated 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested at least annually for impairment 
we perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any other 
table of contents period in which indicators of impairment warrant additional analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the acquisition date fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment calculations are our reportable segments 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions including the discount rate  anticipated revenue growth rate and gross margins  estimated operating and interest expense  and capital expenditures are inherent in these fair value estimates which are based on our internal operating budgets 
as a result  actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the financial statements 
as a result of these uncertainties  we utilize multiple scenarios and assign probabilities to each of the scenarios in the discounted cash flow analysis 
the results of the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
if an impairment charge is incurred  it would negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 
we did not record a goodwill impairment for either our construction services or repair and maintenance services segments in the three year period ended may  although we do not anticipate a future impairment charge  certain events could occur that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events could include  but are not limited to  economic or competitive conditions  a significant change in the project plans of our customers  the economic condition of the customers and industries we serve  and a material negative change in the relationships with one or more of our significant customers 
if our judgments and assumptions change as a result of the occurrence of any of these events or other events that we do not currently anticipate  our expectations as to future results and our estimate of the implied value of one or more of our reporting units also may change 
due to the presence of several impairment indicators  including a loss in market capitalization caused by the turmoil in the debt and capital markets  we performed an interim impairment test in the third quarter of fiscal the results of the interim impairment test indicated that the fair value of the goodwill was in excess of its carrying value at february  we also performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter to determine whether an impairment existed and to determine the amount of headroom at may  headroom is defined as the percentage difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its fair value 
at may   headroom for the construction services segment was and headroom for the repair and maintenance services segment was 
our significant assumptions  including revenue growth rates  gross margins  operating and interest expense and other factors  have been reasonably accurate in recent years  but are likely to change in light of the dynamic competitive environment in which we operate 
assuming that all other components of our fair value estimate remain unchanged  a change in the following assumptions would have the following effect on headroom if the growth rate of estimated revenue decreases one percent from current estimates  headroom for the construction services segment would be reduced from to and headroom for the repair and maintenance services segment would be reduced from to  
table of contents if our estimate of gross margins decreases one percent  headroom for the construction services segment would be reduced from to and headroom for the repair and maintenance services segment would be reduced from to  and if the applicable discount rate increases one percent  headroom for the construction services segment would be reduced from to and headroom for the repair and maintenance services segment would be reduced from to

table of contents results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  construction services and repair and maintenance services 
the majority of the work for both segments is performed in the united states with of revenues generated in canada during fiscal however  the company does continue to seek opportunities for growth in international markets 
the primary services of our construction services segment are aboveground storage tanks for the bulk storage terminal industry  capital construction for the downstream petroleum industry  specialty construction  and electrical instrumentation services for various industries 
these services  including civil structural  mechanical  piping  electrical and instrumentation  millwrighting  and fabrication  are provided for projects of varying complexities  schedule durations  and budgets 
our project experience includes renovations  retrofits  modifications and expansions to existing facilities as well as construction of new facilities 
the primary services of our repair and maintenance services segment are aboveground storage tank repair and maintenance services  planned major and routine maintenance for the downstream petroleum industry  specialty repair and maintenance services and electrical and instrumentation repair and maintenance 
significant fluctuations in revenues  gross profits and operating results are discussed below on a consolidated basis and for each segment 
revenues fluctuate due to many factors  including the changing product mix and project schedules  which are dependent on the level and timing of customer releases of new business 
fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million for fiscal the reduction in consolidated revenues was caused by a decrease of million in construction services revenues partially offset by an increase of million in repair and maintenance services revenues 
consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the improvement of million or was due primarily to an increase in gross profit caused by higher gross margins  which improved from in fiscal to in fiscal the gross margin improvement was due to higher margins in the construction services segment  where the gross margin increased to in the current fiscal year versus in the prior fiscal year 
repair and maintenance services segment gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal consolidated sg a expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the costs relating to our expansion into western canada and the gulf coast region  the acquisition of sm electric company  inc sme in february  and higher employee related and facility costs incurred to build the infrastructure and sales forces necessary to support our long term growth plan 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
net interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in the current year  the non cash amortization of deal fees relating to the senior revolving credit facility and cash interest on our capital leases was partially offset by interest income generated from the investment of excess cash 
the prior year net interest expense was primarily related to the amortization of deal fees on the senior revolving credit facility and interest on short term borrowings under the facility 

table of contents other income in fiscal was million and related primarily to insurance proceeds received 
in comparison  we did not report any other income in fiscal income before income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this million increase occurred primarily due to higher gross profits partially offset by higher sg a expenses 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal in fiscal  certain operating loss carryforwards previously reserved were utilized or deemed to be fully utilizable resulting in a tax benefit of million 
the prior fiscal year included a million tax benefit resulting from the assessment of the realizability of state investment tax credits and other miscellaneous deductions 
net income for fiscal grew to million  or per fully diluted share  versus net income in fiscal of million  or per fully diluted share 
construction services revenues for the construction services segment were million  compared with million in the same period a year earlier 
the decrease of million was due to lower specialty revenues  which decreased million as the construction of the tanks on a gulf coast lng project was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  aboveground storage tank revenues decreased to million in fiscal  versus million in fiscal  and downstream petroleum revenues  decreased to million in fiscal  versus million a year earlier 
partially offsetting these declines were higher electrical and instrumentation revenues  which increased million to million in fiscal  compared to million a year earlier 
this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of sme in february at may   the construction services segment had a backlog of million  as compared to a backlog of million as of may  the decrease of million is due to declines in aboveground storage tank  downstream petroleum and electrical and instrumentation of million  million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in specialty of million 
project cancellations totaling million and million contributed to the backlog reductions in aboveground storage tank and downstream petroleum  respectively 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to improved direct gross margins primarily because fiscal results included million in pretax charges for cost overruns on a gulf coast lng project 
in addition the company experienced improved project execution in fiscal helping to offset the negative impact of unrecovered construction overhead costs due to lower than expected revenues during the year 
operating income and income before income tax expense were million and million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal repair and maintenance services revenues for repair and maintenance services were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the million improvement was due to higher downstream petroleum revenues  which increased million to million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year and higher electrical and instrumentation revenues  which increased million to million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by lower aboveground storage tank revenues  which decreased million to million in fiscal from million during fiscal 
table of contents backlog at may  and may  for the repair and maintenance services segment was million and million  respectively 
the increase of million was due to increases in downstream petroleum of million and electrical and instrumentation of million  partially offset by a decline in aboveground storage tank of million 
included in aboveground storage tank s backlog decline were cancelled projects totaling million 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to an increase in revenues partially offset by a decline in gross margins  which were in fiscal versus in fiscal operating income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal income before income tax expense was million in fiscal and fiscal fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million for fiscal the improvement in consolidated revenues resulted from increases of million in construction services revenues and million in repair and maintenance services revenues 
consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the improvement of million  or was primarily due to revenue growth of million 
consolidated gross margins were unchanged at for both fiscal years despite an improvement in the repair and maintenance services segment  where the gross margin grew to in fiscal versus in fiscal offsetting this improvement was a decline in the construction services segment s gross margin  which was in fiscal versus in fiscal consolidated sg a expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily caused by higher employee related expenses and facility costs incurred to meet the current demands of anticipated growth and a bad debt charge caused by the bankruptcy of a customer that is involved in a contract dispute with the company 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal as the benefit from the growth in revenues was more than offset by the increase in sg a expenses 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline of million was primarily due to the conversion of million of convertible notes to common stock in fiscal  which led to lower amortization of debt issuance costs in fiscal current year interest expense was primarily related to the amortization of deal fees on the senior revolving credit facility and interest on short term borrowings under this facility 
income before income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this million increase occurred due to higher gross profits and lower interest expense  partially offset by higher sg a expenses 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the fiscal tax rate was reduced due to a tax benefit of million resulting from the continuing assessment of the realizability of state investment tax credits and other miscellaneous deductions 
the fiscal rate was favorably impacted by the utilization of losses on disputed contracts  the tax benefits of which had been reserved as a valuation allowance in previous years 
net income for fiscal grew to million  or per fully diluted share  versus net income in fiscal of million  or per fully diluted share 

table of contents construction services revenues for the construction services segment were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the increase of million  or  was primarily due to higher aboveground storage tank revenues  which increased to million in fiscal  versus million in fiscal the increase was also driven by higher revenues in downstream petroleum  which increased to million in fiscal  versus million in fiscal  and by higher specialty revenues  which increased to million in fiscal compared to million a year earlier 
these increases were partially offset by lower electrical and instrumentation revenues  which fell million 
at may   the construction services segment had a backlog of million  as compared to a backlog of million as of may  the decrease of million is due to declines in specialty of million and downstream petroleum of million  partially offset by increases in aboveground storage tank and electrical and instrumentation of and million  respectively 
the decline in specialty backlog was attributable to the completion of a major lng construction project in the gulf coast region 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due largely to the growth in revenues offset partially by reduced gross margins  which fell from in fiscal to in fiscal the gross profit improvement of million occurred despite fiscal results including million in pre tax charges for cost overruns related to an lng construction project in the gulf coast region 
in comparison  fiscal results included pre tax charges of million for this same lng construction project 
the remaining construction services projects experienced higher margins in fiscal than those recognized in fiscal operating income and income before income tax expense were million and million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal repair and maintenance services revenues for repair and maintenance services were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the change was due to higher aboveground storage tank revenues  which improved to million  versus million in fiscal this increase was largely offset by lower downstream petroleum revenues  which fell to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  and lower electrical and instrumentation revenues  which dropped million to million in fiscal from million during fiscal backlog at may  and may  for the repair and maintenance services segment was million and million  respectively 
the increase of million was due to increases in downstream petroleum of million  aboveground storage tank of million and electrical and instrumentation of million 
despite relatively flat year over year revenues  gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and gross margins improved from during fiscal to in fiscal repair and maintenance services gross margins for fiscal benefited from high levels of customer call out work and strong markets  particularly in aboveground storage tank 
operating income and income before income tax expense increased to million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal non gaap financial measure ebitda is a supplemental  non gaap financial measure 
ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because it is used by the financial community 
table of contents as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses 
we believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of income entitled net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information compared with net income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions  which are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
it does not include income taxes 
because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations 
it does not include depreciation or amortization expense 
because we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation or amortization expense has material limitations 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net income follows fiscal year ended may  in thousands net income interest expense  net of interest income in and provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda outlook we believe that our investments in business development  strengthened engineering and construction capabilities  geographic and product expansion as well as the addition of key talent has put us in a stronger position as we move into fiscal this should allow us to manage through the current economic downturn and capitalize on opportunities as the market improves 
we cannot predict the length or severity of the current economic downturn and remain somewhat cautious about the near term outlook of our business 
the uncertainty in the timing and magnitude of the economic recovery and the timing of awards coupled with the seasonality of our business will likely produce uneven fiscal quarterly results 
the market indicators we are seeing indicate a challenging environment in the remainder of calendar year with some improvements starting late in calendar year and early in calendar year financial condition and liquidity overview we define liquidity as the ability to pay our liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations 
our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal were cash flows from operations and cash on hand at the beginning of the year 
cash on hand at may  totaled million and availability under the senior revolving credit facility totaled million  resulting in total liquidity of million 

table of contents factors that routinely impact our short term liquidity and that may impact our long term liquidity include  but are not limited to changes in working capital contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers 
time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears 
therefore  we are routinely required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected 
some of our large construction projects may require significant retentions or security in the form of letters of credit 
capital expenditures strategic investments in new operations acquisitions of new businesses purchases of shares under our stock buyback program contract disputes or collection issues resulting from the failure of a significant customer in fiscal  we funded the acquisitions of sm electric company  inc and the purchase of certain assets  technology and resources for the design and construction of specialty cryogenic tanks with cash on hand 
however  in the future we may elect to raise additional capital by issuing common stock  convertible notes  term debt or increase the amount of our revolving credit facility as necessary to fund our operations or to fund the acquisition of other businesses 
we will continue to evaluate our working capital requirements and other factors to maintain sufficient liquidity 
cash flows from operating activities operations provided million of cash in fiscal the cash provided by operations was primarily due to profitable operating results partially offset by an increase in working capital 
the change in working capital was primarily due to reductions in accounts payable and billings in excess partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and costs in excess 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million of cash in fiscal this was due to capital expenditures of million  and the purchases of sm electric company  inc and certain assets  technology and resources for the design and construction of cryogenic storage tanks for a combined million  partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of million 
the asset sale proceeds relate primarily to the sale of excess property 
fiscal capital expenditures included million for the purchase of construction equipment  million for transportation equipment  million for furniture and fixtures  and million for land and buildings 
assets acquired through capital leases totaled million in fiscal and are reported as non cash additions to property  plant and equipment in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
at may  expected spending on capital projects that have been approved but that are not yet complete totaled million 
the completion of these projects will be funded with cash on hand 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities financing activities used million of cash in fiscal primarily due to capital lease payments of million  credit agreement amendment fees of million and treasury share purchases of million 
partially offsetting these payments were proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under our stock based compensation plans of million and the related tax benefit of million 
senior revolving credit facility the company has a five year  million senior revolving credit facility credit facility that expires on november  the credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the company s subsidiaries and is secured by a lien on substantially all of the company s assets 
the senior revolving credit facility is primarily used to fund short term changes in working capital and the issuance of letters of credit 
at may  million of letters of credit were outstanding to support certain workers compensation insurance programs and construction contracts 
availability at may  totaled million 
we believe the facility provides adequate liquidity and financial flexibility to support our expected growth 
on february   the company entered into an amendment amendment to the credit facility which altered certain key provisions of the credit facility including the following the limitation on share repurchases was increased from million for the life of the credit facility  to million in any calendar year 
the prior limitation on acquisitions of million in any consecutive twelve month period and million for the life of the credit facility was eliminated so long as the company s senior leverage ratio on a pro forma basis as of the end of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the acquisition is below to and availability under the credit facility is at or above after consummation of the acquisition 
if the senior leverage ratio on a pro forma basis as of the end of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the acquisition is over to but below to  acquisitions will be limited to million in a twelve month period  provided there is at least million of availability under the credit facility after the consummation of the acquisition 
a financial covenant was modified to require that we maintain a tangible net worth in an amount which is no less than the sum of million  plus the net proceeds of any issuance of equity that occurs after november   plus of all positive quarterly net income after november  previously  we were required to maintain a tangible net worth of no less than the sum of million  plus the net cash proceeds of any issuance of equity that occurred after august   plus of all positive quarterly net income after august  amounts borrowed under the credit facility will continue to bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  plus in each case  an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio 
the additional margins on the libor based loans increased from between and to between and based on the senior leverage ratio 
the additional margins on the alternate base rate loans increased from between and to between and based on the senior leverage ratio 
the alternate base rate is now the greater of the prime rate  federal funds effective rate plus or libor plus 
previously  the alternate base rate was the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 
the unused revolving credit facility fee increased from between and to between and based on the senior leverage ratio 

table of contents other significant financial covenants that were not changed by the amendment include the following senior leverage ratio not to exceed to  asset coverage ratio to be greater than or equal to to  and  fixed charge coverage ratio to be greater than or equal to to the company is currently in compliance with all affirmative  negative  and financial covenants under the credit facility and is at the lowest margin tier for the libor and alternate base rate loans and the lowest tier for the unused revolving credit facility fee 
however  non compliance with any of these ratios or a violation of other covenants could result in an event of default and reduce availability under the facility 
dividend policy we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and the terms of our credit agreement limits the amount of cash dividends we can pay 
we currently intend to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business 
any payment of cash dividends in the future will depend upon our financial condition  capital requirements and earnings as well as other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 
treasury shares on february  our board of directors authorized a stock buyback program february program that allows the company to purchase up to  shares of common stock provided that such purchases do not exceed million in any calendar year commencing in calendar year and continuing through calendar year the february program replaced the previous stock buyback program that had been in place since october the company did not purchase any common shares under either program in fiscal matrix service may purchase shares in future periods if sufficient liquidity exists and the company believes that it is in the best interest of the shareholders 
in addition to any stock buyback program that may be in effect  the company may withhold shares of common stock to satisfy the tax withholding obligations upon vesting of an employee s deferred shares 
matrix service withheld  shares in fiscal to satisfy these obligations 
these shares were returned to the company s pool of treasury shares 
the company has  treasury shares as of may  and intends to utilize these treasury shares solely in connection with equity awards under the company s stock incentive plans 
commitments as of may   the following commitments were in place to support our ordinary course obligations commitments by expiration period less than year years years more than years total in thousands letters of credit surety bonds total commitments all letters of credit are in support of our workers compensation insurance programs or in support of certain construction contracts 
the letters of credit are issued under our credit facility 
the letters of credit that support our workers compensation programs are expected to renew annually through the term of the credit 
table of contents facility  therefore  they are reported in the same period that the credit facility expires 
the letters of credit that support construction contracts will expire when the related work is complete and the warranty period has passed  therefore  these letters of credit are reported in the period that we expect the warranty period to end 
contractual obligations at may  are summarized below contractual obligations by expiration period less than year years years more than years total in thousands operating leases capital lease obligations total contractual obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk results primarily from our variable rate indebtedness under our senior credit facility  which is influenced by movements in short term rates 
borrowings under our million revolving credit facility are based on an alternate base rate or one  two  three or six month libor as elected by the company plus an additional margin based on our senior leverage ratio 
although there were no amounts outstanding under the facility at may  and we did not borrow under the facility in fiscal  we have in the past and may in the future borrow against our revolving credit line to fund short term working capital needs 
we do not currently utilize interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk  therefore  short term interest rates could have an impact on future interest expense 
financial instruments with interest rate risk at may  were as follows maturity by fiscal year total fair value as of may  in thousands long term debt variable rate debt there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility at may  nor were any amounts borrowed in fiscal at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  plus in each case  an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio 
the alternate base rate is the greater of the prime rate  the federal funds effective rate plus or libor plus
