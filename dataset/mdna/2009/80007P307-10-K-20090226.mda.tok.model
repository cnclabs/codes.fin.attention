overview of our company we are an independent natural gas and crude oil company concentrating on exploration  development and production activities 
we are focused on continuing the exploration and exploitation of our significant holdings in the west texas overthrust  which we refer to as the wto  a natural gas prone geological region where we have operated since the wto includes the pi on field as well as the allison ranch  south sabino  big canyon and mckay creek exploration areas 
we also operate interests in the cotton valley trend in east texas  the gulf coast area  the mid continent and the gulf of mexico 
on november   we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in neg for total consideration of approximately billion  excluding cash acquired 
with core assets in the val verde and permian basins of west texas  including overlapping or contiguous interests in the wto  the neg acquisition dramatically increased our exploration and production segment operations 
in addition to the neg acquisition  we have completed numerous acquisitions of additional working interests in the wto during the period from late through we currently generate the majority of our revenues  earnings and cash flow from the production and sale of natural gas and crude oil 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil and on our ability to find and economically develop and produce natural gas and crude oil reserves 
prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely 
in order to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations  we enter into derivative commodity contracts for a portion of our anticipated future natural gas and crude oil production 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital expenditure programs 
we operate businesses that are complementary to our exploration  development and production activities 
we own related gas gathering and treating facilities  a gas marketing business and an oil field services business 
the extent to which each of these supplemental businesses contributes to our consolidated net income largely is determined by the amount of work each performs for third parties 
revenues and costs related to work performed by our businesses for our own account are eliminated in consolidation and  therefore  do not contribute to our consolidated net income 
our ownership and control of these businesses  however  provide us with operational flexibility and an advantageous cost structure 
recent developments during the second half of  unprecedented levels of volatility in the financial and commodity markets made it necessary for us to reduce and refocus our exploration and development activities  reduce our budget for capital expenditures  explore the potential sale of certain assets and seek additional capital 
private placement of convertible perpetual preferred stock 
in january  we commenced and completed a private placement of  shares of a new series of convertible perpetual preferred stock to qualified institutional buyers eligible under rule a under the securities act 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting offering expenses of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
each share of the convertible perpetual preferred stock has a liquidation preference of and is entitled to an annual dividend of payable semi annually in cash  common stock or any combination thereof  beginning on february  no dividends will accrue or accumulate prior to august  additionally  each share is initially convertible into shares of our common stock  at the holder s option  at any time on or after april  based on an initial conversion price of and subject to customary adjustments in certain circumstances 

table of contents marketing of midstream assets 
in january  we announced our intent to offer for sale certain of our gas gathering and related assets located in the wto 
this process is ongoing as of the date of this filing 
capital expenditure budget 
we are introducing a production guidance range of bcfe to bcfe based on a capital expenditure guidance range of million to million 
based on the current and anticipated near term drilling activity and associated expenditures  it is currently expected that full year results will trend toward the lower half of these ranges 
drilling activity 
we began to decrease the number of rigs running on our properties during december in preparation for reduced activity levels 
at february   we had rigs running compared to a high of rigs operating in the second quarter of east texas north louisiana haynesville shale play we control approximately  acres in the developing haynesville shale play of east texas and north louisiana 
we drilled two vertical test wells within the oakhill field area in rusk county to evaluate the potential for haynesville shale production 
the initial well had a total of feet of haynesville shale thickness and tested at a rate of mmcfe per day 
the second well encountered feet of shale thickness and is awaiting completion 
segment overview we operate in four related business segments exploration and production  drilling and oil field services  midstream gas services and other ancillary business activities 
management evaluates the performance of our business segments based on operating income  which is computed as segment operating revenues less operating expenses and depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment 
these measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business 
set forth in the table below is financial information regarding each of our business segments

includes natural gas liquids 
exploration and production segment we explore for  develop and produce natural gas and crude oil reserves  with a focus on our proved reserves and extensive undeveloped acreage positions in the wto 
we operate substantially all of our wells in our core areas and employ our drilling rigs and other drilling services in the exploration and development of our operated wells and  to a lesser extent  of our non operated wells 

table of contents the primary factors affecting the financial results of our exploration and production segment are the prices we receive for our natural gas and crude oil production  the quantity of our natural gas and crude oil production and changes in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts we use to reduce the volatility of the prices we receive for our natural gas and crude oil production 
because we are vertically integrated  our exploration and production activities affect the results of our drilling and oil field services and midstream gas services segments  especially in times of weak demand for natural gas and crude oil 
our acquisition of neg in november substantially increased our revenues and operating income in our exploration and production segment 
as additional acquisitions have further increased our working interest in the wto  a larger percentage of the work performed by our services segments has been performed for our own account 
as of december   we had  bcfe of estimated net proved reserves with a pv of  million  which is an increase from  bcfe of estimated net proved reserves with a pv of  million as of december  our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was  million at december  as compared to  million at december  and  million at december  for a discussion of pv and reconciliation to standardized measure of discounted net cash flows  see business our business and primary operations proved reserves in item of this report 
the decrease in pv in was primarily attributable to lower commodity prices at december  compared to december  the sec requires public companies utilizing the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties to perform a ceiling limitation calculation at the end of each quarterly reporting period 
under sec guidelines  natural gas and crude oil reserves are calculated based on posted prices on the last day of the reporting period with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements 
as of december   these prices were per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil 
while the overall estimated reserve quantities assigned to our properties increased from december  to december   prices used to determine the future value of our reserves declined to such an extent as to necessitate a ceiling impairment of  million 
exploration and production segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  exploration and production segment revenues increased to million in the year ended december  from million in  an increase of  as a result of a increase in combined production volumes and a increase in the average price we received for the natural gas and crude oil we produced 
during  we increased natural gas production by bcf to bcf and increased crude oil production by mbbls to  mbbls 
the total combined bcfe increase in production was due primarily to successful drilling in the wto and an increase in our average working interest in the wto at december  from at december  
we owned interests in a total of  producing wells at december  compared to  producing wells at december  the average price we received for our natural gas production for the year ended december  increased per mcf  or  to per mcf from per mcf in the average price received for our crude oil production increased to per bbl from per bbl in the average price we received for our natural gas and crude oil production was negatively impacted by the significant decline in natural gas and crude oil prices experienced by the oil and gas industry in the fourth quarter of the average price received for our natural gas and crude oil production during the first nine months of was per mcf and per bbl  respectively  compared to the average price received for our natural gas and crude oil production during the fourth quarter of of per mcf and per bbl  respectively 
including the impact of derivative contract settlements  the effective average price received for natural gas for the year ended december  was per mcf compared to per mcf during our crude oil derivative contract settlements decreased our effective price received for crude oil by per bbl to per bbl for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our oil derivative contract settlements had a minimal impact on our effective price received for crude oil  which was 
our derivative contracts are not designated as hedges and  as a result  gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
internally  management views the settlement of such derivative contracts as adjustments to the price received for natural gas and crude oil production to determine effective prices 
as of december   we had natural gas and crude oil derivative 
table of contents contracts  excluding basis swaps  of bcfe at an average price of per mcfe in place for and bcfe at an average price of per mcfe in place for the company also had natural gas basis swaps in place through for bcf at an average price of per mcf 
for the year ended december   we had an operating loss of  million in our exploration and production segment  compared to operating income of million in the million increase in exploration and production segment revenues and million net gain on our commodity derivative contracts  of which million was unrealized  were offset by a full cost ceiling impairment of  million  a million increase in production expenses and a million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a on natural gas and crude oil properties due to the increase in production 
the full cost ceiling impairment was the result of the decline of the future value of our reserves due to the natural gas and crude oil prices at december  which offset the increase in overall estimated reserve quantities assigned to our properties 
natural gas and crude oil prices were per mcf and per bbl at december  compared to per mcf and per bbl at december  the increase in production expenses was attributable to the increase in the number of operating wells we own and the increase in our average working interests in those wells 
dd a increased due to an increase in our depreciable properties  higher future development costs and increased production 
during and  we entered into natural gas and crude oil swaps and natural gas basis swaps 
given the long term nature of our investment in the wto development program  we believe it prudent to enter into natural gas and crude oil swaps and natural gas basis swaps for a portion of our production in order to stabilize future cash inflows for planning purposes 
during the year ended december   the exploration and production segment reported a million net gain on our commodity derivative contracts million realized loss and million unrealized gain compared to a million net gain million realized gain and million unrealized gain in unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts represent the change in fair value of open derivative contracts during the period 
the unrealized gain on natural gas and crude oil derivative contracts recorded during the year ended december  was attributable to a decrease in average natural gas and crude oil prices at december  compared to the average natural gas and crude oil prices at december  or the contract price for contracts entered into during exploration and production segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   exploration and production segment revenues increased to million from million in the increase in revenues compared to was attributable to increased production primarily due to acquisitions and successful drilling activity 
production volumes increased to bcfe in from bcfe in  representing an increase of bcfe  or 
average combined prices increased  or  to per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in exploration and production segment operating income increased million in to million from million in the million increase in exploration and production segment revenues was partially offset by a million increase in production expenses and a million increase in dd a 
the increase in production expenses was attributable to the additional properties acquired in the neg acquisition and operating expenses on our new wells 
during the year ended december   the exploration and production segment reported a million gain on our derivative positions million realized gain and million unrealized gain compared to a million net gain million realized gain and million unrealized loss in drilling and oil field services segment we drill for our own account primarily in the wto through our drilling and oil field services subsidiary  lariat 
we also drill wells for other natural gas and crude oil companies  primarily located in the west texas region 
as of december   our drilling rig fleet consisted of operational rigs  of which we owned directly and of which were owned by larclay 
our oil field services business conducts operations that complement our drilling 
table of contents services operation 
these services include providing pulling units  trucking  rental tools  location and road construction and roustabout services to us and our subsidiaries as well as to third parties 
in  lariat and its partner  clayton williams energy  inc cwei  formed a limited partnership  larclay  in which we and cwei each have a interest 
larclay acquired twelve sets of rig components and other related equipment to assemble into completed land drilling rigs 
the drilling rigs were to be used for drilling on cwei s prospects or our prospects or for contracting to third parties on daywork drilling contracts 
all but one of these rigs have been assembled 
larclay financed the acquisition cost of the rigs with a loan from a third party  secured by the purchased rigs  and a loan from cwei 
in addition  cwei has guaranteed a portion of the third party debt 
lariat operates the rigs owned by the partnership 
if larclay has an operating shortfall  lariat and cwei are obligated to provide loans to the partnership 
in april  lariat and cwei each made loans of million to larclay under promissory notes 
the notes bear interest at a floating rate based on a london interbank offered rate libor average plus at december  as provided in the larclay partnership agreement 
in june  larclay executed a million revolving promissory note with each of lariat and cwei 
amounts drawn under each revolving promissory note bear interest at a floating rate based on a libor average plus at december  as provided in the larclay partnership agreement 
lariat and cwei each advanced million to larclay under the revolving promissory notes during the year ended december  the cash shortfalls that larclay experienced in resulted from principal payments due pursuant to its rig loan agreement 
as a result of current economic conditions and continued cash shortfalls for larclay  we have fully impaired both our investment in and notes receivable due from larclay  resulting in impairment expense of approximately million  as of december  although lariat s interest in larclay affords us access to larclay s eleven operational rigs  we do not control larclay 
we account for our investment in larclay under the equity method of accounting  and  therefore  do not consolidate the results of its operations with ours 
only the activities of our wholly owned drilling and oil field services subsidiaries are included in the financial results of our drilling and oil field services segment 
the financial results of our drilling and oil field services segment depend on many factors  particularly the demand for and the price we can charge for our services 
we provide drilling services for our account and for others  generally on a daywork  and less often on a turnkey  contract basis 
we generally assess the complexity and risks of operations  the on site drilling conditions  the type of equipment to be used  the anticipated duration of the work to be performed and the prevailing market rates in determining the contract terms we offer 
daywork contracts 
under a daywork drilling contract  we provide a drilling rig with required personnel to our customer who supervises the drilling of the well 
we are paid based on a negotiated fixed rate per day while the rig is in use 
daywork drilling contracts specify the equipment to be used  the size of the hole and the depth of the well 
under a daywork drilling contract  the customer bears a large portion of the out of pocket drilling costs  and we generally bear no part of the usual risks associated with drilling  such as time delays and unanticipated costs 
as of december   sixteen of our directly owned rigs were operating under daywork contracts and thirteen of these were working for our account 
turnkey contracts 
under a typical turnkey contract  a customer pays us to drill a well to a specified depth and under specified conditions for a fixed price  regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well 
we provide most of the equipment and drilling supplies required to drill the well 
we subcontract for related services such as the provision of casing crews  cementing and well logging 
generally  we do not receive progress payments and are paid only after the well is drilled 
as of december   none of our rigs was operating under a turnkey contract 
drilling and oil field services segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  drilling and oil field services segment revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  resulting in an operating loss of million during compared to operating income of million during our drilling and oil field services segment records revenues and operating income only on wells drilled for or on behalf of third parties 
the portion of drilling costs incurred by our drilling and oil field services segment relating to our ownership interest is capitalized as part of 
table of contents our full cost pool 
the decline in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of rigs operating on our properties  an increase in our ownership interest in our natural gas and crude oil properties resulting in decreases in services performed for third parties  and a decline in revenue earned per day by rigs working for third parties during compared to during  an average of of the operational rigs we owned were working for our account compared to an average of of the operational rigs working for our account during as a result  during the year ended december   of drilling and oil field service segment revenues were generated by work performed on our own account and eliminated in consolidation compared to during additionally  the average daily rate received per rig working for third parties declined to an average of  per rig per working day during from an average of  per rig per working day during during the year ended december   two of our rigs working for third parties operated under turnkey contracts  while none of our rigs operated under turnkey contracts during the year ended december  additionally  the daywork and turnkey contracts in place for generated higher per day revenue due to higher rates in place for those contracts 
the operating loss of million in is attributed to the million impairment on the investment in and notes receivable due from larclay 
drilling and oil field services segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  our drilling and oil field services segment reported million in revenues  a decrease of million  or  from operating income decreased to million in from million in the decline in revenues and operating income is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of rigs operating on our properties and an increase in our ownership interest in our natural gas and crude oil properties 
with the neg acquisition and other wto property acquisitions during  our average working interest increased to approximately in the wells we operated in the wto 
during the year ended december   of drilling and oil field service segment revenues were generated by work performed on our own account and eliminated in consolidation compared to in midstream gas services segment we provide gathering  compression  processing and treating services of natural gas in west texas  primarily through our wholly owned subsidiary  sandridge energy midstream  inc formerly known as roc gas company  inc 
through our gas marketing subsidiary  integra energy  we buy and sell natural gas produced from our operated wells as well as third party operated wells 
gas marketing revenue is one of our largest revenue components  however  gas marketing is a very low margin business 
substantially all of our marketing fees are billed on a per unit basis 
on a consolidated basis  gas purchases and other costs of sales include the total value we receive from third parties for the natural gas we sell and the amount we pay for natural gas  which are reported as midstream and marketing expense 
the primary factors affecting our midstream gas services are the quantity of natural gas we gather  treat and market and the prices we pay and receive for natural gas 
midstream gas services segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  midstream gas services segment revenues for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the increase in midstream gas services revenues is attributable to larger third party volumes transported and marketed through our gathering systems during compared to as well as an overall increase in natural gas prices in compared to operating income generated by our midstream gas services segment decreased million in to million from million in due to an increase in depreciation expense attributable to higher carrying values of midstream gathering and treating assets 
midstream gas services segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  midstream gas services segment revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the decrease in midstream gas services revenues is attributable to 
table of contents the increase in our working interest in the wto as a result of the neg and other acquisitions 
operating income increased to million in from million in primarily due to lower gas prices paid 
other segment our other segment consists primarily of our co gathering and sales operations and corporate operations 
we conduct our co gathering and sales operations through our wholly owned subsidiary  sandridge co  llc formerly operated through petrosource energy company  llc 
sandridge co gathers co from natural gas treatment plants located in west texas and transports and sells this co for use in tertiary crude oil recovery operations conducted by us and third parties 
the operating loss in the other segment was million for compared to million for and million for the increases in operating losses from through are primarily attributable to increases in corporate and support staff necessary to accommodate the growth in our exploration and development programs and our production levels during that time 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased to  million for the year ended december  from million in this increase was due to a million increase in natural gas and crude oil sales and million increase in midstream and marketing revenues  partially offset by lower revenues in our drilling and services operations 
year ended december  change change in thousands revenues natural gas and crude oil drilling and services midstream and marketing other total revenues total natural gas and crude oil revenues increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  primarily as a result of the increase in natural gas and crude oil production volumes and prices received on our production 
total natural gas production increased to bcf in compared to bcf in  while crude oil production increased to  mbbls in from  mbbls in the average price received  excluding the impact of derivative contracts  for our natural gas and crude oil production increased in to a combined equivalent price of per mcfe compared to per mcfe in the average price we received for our natural gas and crude oil production was negatively impacted by the significant decline in natural gas and crude oil prices experienced by the oil and gas industry in the fourth quarter of drilling and services revenues decreased to million in compared to million in the decline in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of our rigs operating on our properties  the increase in our ownership interest in our natural gas and crude oil properties resulting in decreases in services performed for third parties  and the decline in revenue earned per day by rigs working for third parties 
the average daily rate we received per rig working for third parties declined to an average of  per rig per working day during from an average of  per rig per working day during midstream and marketing revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in this increase is primarily due to larger production volumes transported and marketed for third parties with ownership in our wells or ownership in other wells 
table of contents connected to our gathering systems during compared to higher natural gas prices prevalent during the first nine months of compared to also contributed to the increase 
operating costs and expenses 
total operating costs and expenses increased to  million during  compared to million in  primarily as a result of our full cost ceiling impairment along with increases in our production related costs  midstream and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in costs attributable to our drilling and services operations as well as increased gains on commodity derivative contracts 
year ended december  change change in thousands operating costs and expenses production production taxes drilling and services midstream and marketing depreciation  depletion  and amortization natural gas and crude oil depreciation  depletion and amortization other impairment general and administrative gain on derivative contracts gain on sale of assets total operating costs and expenses production expense includes the costs associated with our exploration and production activities  including  but not limited to  lease operating expense and treating costs 
production expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  primarily due to increased production from our drilling activity and the increase in the number of producing wells in which we have a working interest 
production taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  primarily as a result of the increase in production and the increased prices received for production during the year ended december  the effect on production taxes of the increased prices received for our production was offset by an increase in production tax exemptions realized during compared to as a result  production taxes on a unit of production basis remained constant at per mcfe for and drilling and services expenses  which includes operating expenses of the drilling  oil field services and co services companies  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in  primarily because of the increase in the number and working interest ownership of the wells we drilled for our own account  which resulted in a decrease in services performed for third parties 
midstream and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in  due primarily to the larger production volumes transported and marketed during the year ended december  on behalf of third parties compared to dd a for our natural gas and crude oil properties increased to million during from million in our dd a per mcfe increased to from in the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in our depreciable properties  higher future development costs and increased production 
our production increased to bcfe in from bcfe in dd a for our other assets consists primarily of depreciation of our drilling rigs  midstream gathering and compression facilities and other equipment 
the million increase in dd a for our other assets was 
table of contents attributable primarily to higher carrying costs of our rigs  due to upgrades and retrofitting during  and our midstream gathering and treating assets  due to upgrades made throughout and we calculate depreciation of property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
our drilling rigs and related oil field services equipment are depreciated over an average seven year useful life 
at december   we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  million on our properties as total capitalized costs of our natural gas and crude oil properties exceeded our full cost ceiling limitation 
there was no full cost ceiling impairment as of december  the additional impairment expenses related to the impairment of our investment in and notes receivable due from larclay 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to an increase in corporate salaries and wages  including non cash stock compensation expense 
the increase in corporate salaries is primarily due to the increase in corporate and support staff added to accommodate our growth 
as of december   we had corporate employees compared to at december  included in corporate salaries and wages was non cash stock compensation expense of million in and million in corporate salaries and wages were partially offset by capitalized general and administrative expenses of million for and million for in accordance with the full cost method of accounting  we capitalize  into the full cost pool  internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
due to the decline in average natural gas and crude oil prices during the second half of  we recorded a gain of million million unrealized gain and million realized loss on our derivatives contracts for compared to a million gain million unrealized gain and million realized gain in the unrealized gain recorded during was attributable to a decrease in average natural gas prices at december  compared to the average natural gas prices at december  or the various contract dates for contracts entered into during other income expense 
total net other expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase is reflected in the table below 
year ended december  change change in thousands other income expense interest income interest expense minority interest income from equity investments other income  net total other income expense  net loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income interest income decreased to million in from million in this decrease was generally due to lower excess cash levels during compared to interest expense increased to million  net of million of capitalized interest  in  from million  net of million of capitalized interest  in the increase in interest expense for was the result of higher average debt balances outstanding during compared to an million unrealized loss related to our interest rate swap also contributed to the increase in interest expense for in march  the 
table of contents unamortized debt issuance costs totaling million related to our senior bridge facility were expensed resulting in higher interest expense 
during the year ended december   we reported income from equity investments of million compared to million in due to decreases in profitability experienced by our unconsolidated equity investees  larclay and grey ranch  lp we reported an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to income tax expense of million in the income tax benefit represented an effective income tax rate of compared to in the low effective income tax rate associated with the loss before income taxes of  million is predominantly due to a valuation allowance being established against our net deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax position changed from a net deferred tax liability as of december  to a net deferred tax asset as of december  due to the recording of a full cost ceiling impairment of  million 
the valuation allowance serves to reduce the tax benefits recognized from the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on the weight of all available evidence 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  impact of the neg acquisition 
the results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of neg from november  the results of operations for the year ended december  include the neg acquisition for the full year 
although neg was principally an exploration and production company  the acquisition affected several of our revenue and expense categories 
revenues and expenses related to our natural gas and crude oil operations increased due to increased production from the acquired neg properties 
revenues and expenses relating to our drilling and services and midstream and marketing operations decreased due to increased intercompany eliminations as more services were provided on company owned properties 
general and administrative expenses increased due to the addition of new staff 
interest expense increased due to the additional borrowings incurred in conjunction with the neg acquisition 
revenues 
total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase was due to a million increase in natural gas and crude oil sales and was partially offset by lower revenues in our other segments 
year ended december  change change in thousands revenues natural gas and crude oil drilling and services midstream and marketing other total revenues total natural gas and crude oil revenues increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  primarily as a result of an increase in natural gas and crude oil production volumes 
total natural gas production increased to bcf in compared to bcf in  while crude oil production increased to  mbbls in from mbbls in the increase was due to the neg acquisition and our successful drilling in the wto 
the average price received for our natural gas and crude oil production increased in to per mcfe compared to per mcfe in  excluding the impact of derivative contracts 
drilling and services revenues decreased to million in compared to million in the decline in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of our rigs operating on our properties and an increase in our ownership interest in our natural gas and crude oil properties 
midstream and marketing revenues decreased million  or  with revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million in the neg acquisition significantly decreased 
table of contents our midstream gas services revenues as more gas was transported for our own account 
prior to the acquisition  transportation  treating and processing of gas for neg was recorded as midstream gas services revenues 
other revenue decreased to million during from million in the decrease was primarily due to the sale of various non energy related assets to our former president and chief operating officer 
revenues related to these assets are included in the period prior to their sale in august this decrease was slightly offset by an increase in revenues generated by our co operations 
operating costs and expenses 
total operating costs and expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to increases in our production related costs as well as an increase in corporate staff 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in costs attributable to our drilling and services and midstream and marketing operations as well as increased gains on derivative instruments 
year ended december  change change in thousands operating costs and expenses production production taxes drilling and services midstream and marketing depreciation  depletion  and amortization natural gas and crude oil depreciation  depletion and amortization other general and administrative gain on derivative instruments gain on sale of assets total operating costs and expenses production expenses increased million due to increased production from our drilling activity and the addition of the neg properties 
the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in lease operating expenses due to an increase in the number of wells we operate 
production taxes increased million  or  to million primarily due to increased natural gas production as a result of our drilling activity and the addition of the neg properties in drilling and services and midstream and marketing expenses decreased and respectively  during compared to primarily because of the increase in the number and working interest ownership of the wells we drilled for our own account 
dd a for our natural gas and crude oil properties increased to million during from million in our dd a per mcfe increased to from in the increase is primarily attributable to our capital expenditures and the neg acquisition  which increased our depreciable properties by the purchase price plus future development costs and also increased production 
our production increased to bcfe from bcfe in the million increase in dd a for our other assets was due primarily to our increased investments in rigs  other oilfield services equipment and midstream assets 
during and  capital expenditures for drilling rigs  other oilfield services equipment and midstream assets totaled approximately million 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was principally attributable to a million increase in corporate salaries and wages due to a significant increase in corporate and support staff 
as of december   we had  employees compared to  at december  the increase in corporate salaries and wages was partially offset by million in capitalized general and administrative expenses  a million decrease due to a legal settlement recorded in and a 
table of contents million decrease in stock compensation expense 
during we settled a legal dispute resulting in an additional loss on the settlement of million 
as part of a severance package for certain executive officers  the board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain stock awards resulting in increased compensation expense recognized during there were no general and administrative expenses capitalized in for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million million unrealized gain and million realized gain on our derivative contracts compared to a million gain million unrealized loss and million realized gain in the unrealized gain recorded during was attributable to a decrease in average natural gas prices at december  as compared to the average natural gas prices at december  or the various contract dates for contracts entered into during other income expense 
total net other expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase is reflected in the table below 
year ended december  change change in thousands other income expense interest income interest expense minority interest income from equity investments other income  net total other expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income interest income increased to million in from million in this increase was due to interest income from investment of excess cash after the repayment of debt 
interest expense increased to million during from million in this increase was attributable to increased average debt balances 
to finance the neg acquisition  we entered into a million senior credit facility  which had an initial borrowing base of million  and an million senior bridge facility 
in march  we repaid the senior bridge facility and expensed the related unamortized debt issuance costs of million  which resulted in higher interest expense 
during the year ended december  we reported income from equity investments of million compared to million in approximately million of the increase was attributable to income from our interest in the grey ranch treating plant  which experienced increased profitability due to higher levels of utilization in compared to approximately million of the increase was attributable to income from larclay as all of larclay s rigs had been delivered and all but one rig was operational by december  we reported income tax expense of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the income tax expense represented an effective income tax rate of compared to in the lower effective income tax rate in was attributable to favorable percentage depletion deductions during that period 
liquidity and capital resources summary our operating cash flow is influenced mainly by the prices that we receive for our natural gas and crude oil production  the quantity of natural gas we produce and  to a lesser extent  the quantity of crude oil we produce  the success of our development and exploration activities  the demand for our drilling rigs and oil field services and the 
table of contents rates we receive for these services  and the margins we obtain from our natural gas and co gathering and treating contracts 
debt and equity capital markets experienced adverse conditions during the latter part of continued volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt due to increased interest rates  and may affect our ability to access these markets 
currently  we do not believe our liquidity has been  or in the near future will be  materially affected by recent events in the global financial markets 
nevertheless  we continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of the lenders under our senior credit facility 
to date  the only disruption in our ability to access the full amounts available under our senior credit facility was the bankruptcy of lehman brothers commodity services  inc lehman brothers  a lender responsible for of the obligations under our senior credit facility 
we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruptions in the credit markets 
our senior credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount  currently billion 
the borrowing base is subject to review semi annually  however  the lenders reserve the right to have one additional re determination of the borrowing base per calendar year 
we may request up to two unscheduled re determinations per year 
the borrowing base is determined based upon proved developed producing reserves  proved developed non producing reserves  and proved undeveloped reserves 
our borrowing base is redetermined in april and october of each year based on proved reserves 
our ability to develop properties and changes in commodity prices may affect the borrowing base of our senior credit facility 
on november   we completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
we sold  shares of our common stock  including  shares sold directly to an entity controlled by our chief executive officer and president 
after deducting underwriting discounts of approximately million and offering expenses of approximately million  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds were utilized as follows in millions repayment of outstanding balance and accrued interest on senior credit facility repayment of note payable and accrued interest incurred in connection with recent acquisition excess cash to fund capital expenditures total in may  we privately placed million of our senior notes due we used million of the million net proceeds received from the offering to repay the total balance outstanding on our senior credit facility 
the remaining proceeds were used to fund a portion of our capital expenditures for as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  and we had approximately million available to be drawn  excluding amounts to be funded by lehman brothers  under our senior credit facility based on a borrowing base of billion 
amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility at december  totaled million 
as of december   we had approximately billion in total debt outstanding 
as of february   the balance outstanding under our senior credit facility was million  and million was available to be drawn under our senior credit facility after consideration of our million in outstanding letters of credit and excluding amounts to be funded by lehman brothers 
in january  we completed a private placement of  shares of convertible perpetual preferred stock to qualified institutional buyers eligible under rule a under the securities act 
the placement included  shares of convertible perpetual preferred stock issued upon the full exercise of the initial purchasers option to cover over allotments 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting offering expenses of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe our cash flows from operations  current cash and investments on hand  availability under our senior credit facility  proceeds from our private offering of convertible perpetual preferred stock and anticipated proceeds from the sale of our midstream assets located in the pi on field  together with potential access to the credit markets  will be sufficient to meet our 
table of contents capital expenditures budget  debt service requirements and working capital needs for the next months 
we have the ability to reduce our capital expenditures budget if cash flows are not available 
capital expenditures we dedicate and expect to continue to dedicate a substantial portion of our capital expenditure program toward the exploration  development  production and acquisition of natural gas and crude oil reserves 
our capital expenditures  on an accrual basis  by segment for the past three years are summarized below year ended december  in thousands capital expenditures exploration and production drilling and oil field services midstream gas services other capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions acquisitions total for  we have budgeted a range of million to million for capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions 
the majority of our capital expenditures will be discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows decline from expected levels or we are unable to obtain capital on attractive terms 
we may increase or decrease planned capital expenditures depending on natural gas prices  asset sales and the availability of capital through the issuance of additional long term debt or equity 
working capital our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments 
absent any significant effects from our commodity derivative instruments  we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital because our capital spending generally exceeds our cash flows from operations and we generally use excess cash  when available  to pay down borrowings outstanding under our credit arrangements 
we maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our senior credit facility 
as of december   we had approximately million available to be drawn under our senior credit facility  excluding amounts to be funded by lehman brothers 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million compared to a deficit of million at december  current assets increased million at december   compared to current assets at december   primarily due to a million increase in our current derivative contract assets resulting from the decline in natural gas and crude oil market prices compared to the contract prices 
current liabilities increased million primarily as a result of an increase of million in accounts payable 

table of contents cash flows our cash flows are as follows year ended december  in thousands cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily due to our million increase in revenues as a result of our increase in production volumes related to our drilling activities during these increases were partially offset by increases in midstream and marketing expenses and general and administrative costs such as salaries and wages 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased million to million in from million in primarily due to our million increase in net income as a result of our approximately increase in production volumes related to the neg and various other acquisitions as well as our drilling success 
also  contributing to this increase was million in realized gains on our derivative contracts 
these increases were partially offset by increases in general and administrative costs such as salaries and wages 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities increased to  million during from  million in due to the expansion of our capital expenditure program in during  our capital expenditures  excluding capital expenditures accrued at december   were  million in our exploration and production segment  million for drilling and oil field services  million for midstream gas services and million for other capital expenditures 
cash flows used in investing activities increased to  million during from  million in during  we acquired neg for million  net of cash received and million in common stock 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment during were  million as compared to million in as we expanded our capital expenditure program 
during  our capital expenditures were  million in our exploration and production segment  million for drilling and oil field services  million for midstream gas services and million for other capital expenditures 
financing activities 
since december  we have used equity issuances and borrowings to supplement our cash flows from operations to fund our growth 
proceeds from borrowings increased to  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for  mainly as a result of our issuance of million in senior notes due in may we repaid borrowings of approximately  million during  leaving net borrowings of approximately  million for the year 
our financing activities provided  million in cash for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  during  we raised  million in equity issuances and had net cash repayments of million of debt 
our equity issuances included the november initial public offering of our common stock yielding net proceeds of million and a march private placement of our common stock  which provided net proceeds of approximately million 
proceeds from borrowings were  million during and we repaid approximately  million  leaving net cash repayments during of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds from our term loan and the common stock issuances to repay our senior bridge facility and all of the outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our financing activities provided  million in cash during compared to  million in 
table of contents indebtedness senior credit facility 
on november   we entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  as administrative agent 
the senior credit facility matures on november  and is available to be drawn on and repaid without restriction so long as we are in compliance with its terms  including certain financial covenants 
the senior credit facility bank group consists of financial institutions 
the largest commitment from any lender in the syndicate is of the facility 
the credit agreement for the facility contains various covenants that limit our ability  and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to grant certain liens  make certain loans and investments  make distributions  redeem stock  redeem or prepay debt  merge or consolidate with or into a third party  or engage in certain asset dispositions  including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
additionally  the senior credit facility limits our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness with certain exceptions  including under the senior notes as discussed below 
on october   lehman brothers  a lender under our senior credit facility  filed for bankruptcy 
at the time that its parent  lehman brothers holdings  inc  declared bankruptcy on september   lehman brothers elected not to fund its pro rata share  or  of borrowings requested by us under the senior credit facility 
accordingly  we do not anticipate that lehman brothers will fund its pro rata share of any future borrowing requests 
we currently do not expect this reduced availability of amounts under the senior credit facility to impact our liquidity or business operations 
the senior credit facility also contains financial covenants  including maintenance of agreed upon levels for the i ratio of total funded debt to ebitdax as defined in the senior credit facility  which may not exceed calculated using the last four completed fiscal quarters  ii ratio of ebitdax to interest expense plus current maturities of long term debt  which must be at least calculated using the last four completed fiscal quarters  and iii current ratio  which must be at least in the current ratio calculation  as defined in the senior credit facility  any amounts available to be drawn under the senior credit facility are included in current assets  and unrealized assets and liabilities resulting from mark to market adjustments on our derivative contracts are disregarded

table of contents principal and interest in the amount of million 
the notes have a prepayment penalty currently ranging from to that is triggered if we repay the notes prior to maturity 
on november   we entered into a million note payable  which is fully secured by one of the buildings and a parking garage located on our property in downtown oklahoma city  oklahoma 
we purchased the property in july to serve as our corporate headquarters 
the mortgage bears interest at per annum and matures on november  payments of principal and interest in the amount of approximately million are due on a quarterly basis through the maturity date 
we made payments of principal and interest on this note totaling million and million  respectively  during we have financed the purchase of other equipment used in our business 
at december   the aggregate outstanding balance on these financings was million 
we substantially repaid such borrowings during july senior term loan and senior floating rate term loan 
on march   we issued billion principal amount of unsecured senior term loans 
a portion of the proceeds of the senior term loans was used to repay the senior bridge facility described below under senior bridge facility 
the senior term loans included both a floating rate tranche and fixed rate tranche as described below 
the floating rate tranche consisted of a million senior term loan at a variable rate with interest payable quarterly and principal due on april  the variable rate term loan bore interest  at our option  at libor plus or the higher of i the federal funds rate  as defined  plus or ii a bank s prime rate plus 
the fixed rate tranche consisted of a million senior term loan at a fixed rate of per annum with principal due on april  under the terms of the fixed rate term loan  interest was payable quarterly and during the first four years interest could be paid  at our option  either entirely in cash or entirely with additional fixed rate term loans 
as discussed below  the senior term loans were exchanged pursuant to the senior term loan credit agreement 
senior notes due and senior floating rate notes due on may   we completed an offer to exchange the senior term loans for senior unsecured notes with registration rights  as required under the senior term loan credit agreement 
we issued million of senior notes due in exchange for an equal outstanding principal amount of our fixed rate term loan and million of senior floating rate notes due in exchange for an equal outstanding principal amount of our variable rate term loan 
the newly issued senior notes had terms that were substantially identical to those of the exchanged senior term loans 
during the third quarter of  we filed a registration statement to enable holders of the notes to exchange them for substantially identical notes that are registered under the securities act 
all unregistered notes had been exchanged for registered notes by october  in january  we entered into a million notional amount interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution that effectively fixed our interest rate on the variable rate term loan at an annual rate of 
as a result of the exchange of the variable rate term loan to senior floating rate notes  the interest rate swap is now being used to fix the variable libor interest rate on the senior floating rate notes at an annual rate of through april we may redeem some or all of the senior floating rate notes at specified redemption prices on or after april  and may redeem some or all of the senior notes at specified redemption prices on or after april  we incurred million of debt issuance costs in connection with the senior term loans 
as the senior term loans were exchanged for senior unsecured notes with substantially identical terms  the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of the senior term loans are being amortized over the term of the senior notes and the senior floating rate notes

redeemable convertible preferred stock prior to the conversion of our redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock during  each holder of our redeemable convertible preferred stock was entitled to quarterly cash dividends at the annual rate of of the accreted value  per share  of their redeemable convertible preferred stock 
each share of redeemable convertible preferred stock was convertible into approximately shares of common stock at the option of the holder  subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
during march  holders of  shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock elected to convert those shares into  shares of our common stock 
in may  we converted the remaining outstanding  shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into  shares of our common stock as permitted under the terms of the redeemable convertible preferred stock 
these conversions resulted in total charges to retained earnings of million in accelerated accretion expense related to the converted redeemable convertible preferred shares

no escrow funds were returned to us during one of the escrow accounts requires us to deposit additional funds in an escrow account equal to of the net proceeds  as defined  from certain of our offshore properties 
during  we deposited approximately million in the escrow account 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and prepare estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
see note summary of organization and significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
proved reserves 
over of our reserves are estimated on an annual basis by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
however  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process is very complex and relies on assumptions and subjective interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data  and the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  as a result of volatility and changing market conditions  commodity prices and future development costs will change from period to period  causing estimates of proved reserves to change  as well as causing estimates of future net revenues to change 
for the years ended december   and  we revised our proved reserves from prior years reports by approximately bcfe  bcfe and bcfe  respectively  due to market prices at the end of the applicable period or production performance indicating more or less reserves in place or larger or smaller reservoir size than initially estimated or additional proved reserve bookings within the original field boundaries 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our most significant financial estimates involving our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
these revisions may be material and could materially affect our future depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses 
method of accounting for natural gas and crude oil properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and natural gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we follow the full cost method of accounting 
all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and crude oil properties are capitalized 
exploration and development 
table of contents costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding natural gas and crude oil reserves 
amortization of natural gas and crude oil properties is provided using the unit of production method based on estimated proved natural gas and crude oil reserves 
sales and abandonments of natural gas and crude oil properties being amortized are accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool  with no gain or loss recognized  unless the adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved natural gas and crude oil reserves 
a significant alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur upon the sale of reserves involving less than of the reserve quantities of a cost center 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and natural gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs are subject to a limitation 
the capitalized cost of natural gas and crude oil properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved natural gas and crude oil reserves  discounted at per annum  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  plus estimated salvage value  less related tax effects the ceiling limitation 
the full cost ceiling limitation is calculated using natural gas and crude oil prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for basis or location differential  held constant over the life of the reserves 
if capitalized costs exceed the ceiling limitation  the excess must be charged to expense 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
at december   total capitalized costs of our natural gas and crude oil properties exceeded our ceiling limitation resulting in a non cash ceiling impairment of  million 
unevaluated properties 
the balance of unevaluated properties consists of capital costs incurred for undeveloped acreage  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination  together with capitalized interest costs for these projects 
these costs are initially excluded from our amortization base until the outcome of the project has been determined or  generally  until it is known whether proved reserves will or will not be assigned to the property 
we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess our properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
our assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
we estimate that substantially all of our costs classified as unproved as of the balance sheet date will be evaluated and transferred within a six year period from the date of acquisition  contingent on our capital expenditures and drilling program 
asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations represent the estimated future abandonment costs of tangible long lived assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines and other facilities 
we estimate the fair value of an asset s retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
we employ a present value technique to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  which reflects certain assumptions  including an inflation rate  our credit adjusted  risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability based on third party quotes and current actual costs 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 
revenue recognition and gas balancing 
natural gas and crude oil revenues are recorded when title passes to the customer  net of royalties  discounts and allowances  as applicable 
we account for natural gas and crude oil 
table of contents production imbalances using the sales method  whereby we recognize revenue on all natural gas and crude oil sold to our customers notwithstanding the fact that its ownership may be less than of the natural gas and crude oil sold 
liabilities are recorded for imbalances greater than our proportionate share of remaining estimated natural gas and crude oil reserves 
we recognize revenues and expenses generated from daywork drilling contracts as the services are performed  since we do not bear the risk of completion of the well 
under turnkey contracts  we bear the risk of completion of the well  therefore  revenues and expenses are recognized when the well is substantially completed 
under this method  substantial completion is determined when the well bore reaches the negotiated depth as stated in the contract 
the duration of these contracts typically ranges from to days 
the entire amount of a loss  if any  is recorded when the loss is determinable 
the costs of uncompleted drilling contracts include expenses incurred to date on turnkey contracts  which are still in process at the end of the period 
we may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment and personnel 
mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one market to another are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract 
the contract terms typically range from to days 
revenues of our midstream gas services segment are derived from providing supply  transportation  balancing and sales services for producers and wholesale customers on our natural gas pipelines  as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
midstream gas services are primarily undertaken to realize incremental margins on gas purchased at the wellhead  and provide value added services to customers 
in general  natural gas purchased and sold by our midstream gas business is priced at a published daily or monthly index price 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
revenues are recognized upon delivery of natural gas to customers and or when services are rendered  pricing is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales of co is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer 
we recognize service fees related to the transportation of co as revenue when the related service is provided 
property  plant and equipment  net 
other capitalized costs  including drilling equipment  natural gas gathering and treating equipment  transportation equipment and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
depreciation of drilling equipment is recorded using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 
depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from to years 
realization of the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if any asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in such estimates could cause us to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
when property and equipment components are disposed of  the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases 
temporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial statement purposes and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will be deductible in future years tax returns and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years tax returns 
as of december   we had recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax position changed from a net deferred tax liability as of december  to a net deferred tax asset as of december  due to the recording of a full cost ceiling impairment of  million 
the valuation 
table of contents allowance serves to reduce the tax benefits recognized from the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on the weight of all available evidence 
derivative financial instruments 
to manage risks related to increases in interest rates and changes in natural gas and crude oil prices  we enter into interest rate swaps and natural gas and crude oil futures contracts 
we recognize all of our derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative contract depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
for those derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments  we designate the hedging instrument  based on the exposure being hedged  as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge 
for derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments  the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change 
none of our derivatives was designated as a hedging instrument during  and new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the discussion in this section provides information about the financial instruments we use to manage commodity price and interest rate volatility 
all contracts are financial contracts  which are settled in cash and do not require the actual delivery of a commodity quantity to satisfy settlement 
commodity price risk 
our most significant market risk relates to the prices we receive for our natural gas and crude oil production 
for example  crude oil prices have declined from a record high of per barrel in july to approximately per barrel in december meanwhile  natural gas futures prices during ranged from as high as per mcf in july to as low as per mcf in december in light of the historical volatility of these commodities  we periodically have entered into  and expect in the future to enter into  derivative arrangements aimed at reducing the variability of natural gas and crude oil prices we receive for our production 
from time to time  we enter into commodity pricing derivative contracts for a portion of our anticipated production volumes depending upon management s view of opportunities under the then current market conditions 
we do not intend to enter into derivative contracts that would exceed our expected production volumes for the period covered by the derivative arrangement 
our current credit agreement limits our ability to enter into derivative transactions to of expected production volumes from estimated proved reserves 
future credit agreements could require a minimum level of commodity price hedging 
the use of derivative contracts also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations under the contracts 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty 
we currently have seventeen approved derivative counterparties  sixteen of which are lenders under our senior credit facility 
we currently have derivative contracts outstanding with twelve of these counterparties 
we have no derivative contracts in and beyond with counterparties outside of those that are also part of our senior credit facility 
lehman brothers is a counterparty on one of our derivative contracts 
due to the bankruptcy of lehman brothers and its parent  lehman brothers holdings  inc  we did not assign any value to this derivative contract notional of  mmcf at december  we use  and may continue to use  a variety of commodity based derivative contracts  including collars  fixed price swaps and basis protection swaps 
our fixed price swap transactions are settled based upon nymex prices  and our basis protection swap transactions are settled based upon the index price of natural gas at the waha hub  a west texas gas marketing and delivery center 
settlement for natural gas derivative contracts occurs in the production month 
while we believe that the natural gas and crude oil price derivative arrangements we enter into are important to our program to manage price variability for our production  we have not designated any of our derivative contracts 
table of contents as hedges for accounting purposes 
we record all derivative contracts on the balance sheet at fair value  which reflects changes in natural gas and crude oil prices 
we establish fair value of our derivative contracts by price quotations obtained from counterparties to the derivative contracts 
changes in fair values of our derivative contracts are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in current period earnings 
as a result  our current period earnings may be significantly affected by changes in fair value of our commodities derivative contracts 
changes in fair value are principally measured based on period end prices compared to the contract price

credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by one or more of our counterparties under any of our credit arrangements 
recently  the ability of certain investment banks and other financial institutions to meet their financial obligations has been of increasing concern 
a portion of our liquidity is concentrated in derivative contracts that enable us to mitigate a portion of our exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices and interest rate volatility 
we periodically review the credit quality of each counterparty to our derivative contracts and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty to limit our credit risk exposure with respect to these contracts 
additionally  we apply a credit default risk rating factor for our counterparties in determining the fair value of our derivative contracts 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure budget is partially dependent upon the availability of funds under our senior credit facility 
in order to mitigate the credit risk associated with individual financial institutions committed to participate in our senior credit facility  our bank group consists of financial institutions with commitments ranging from to 
lehman brothers  a lender under our senior credit facility  declared bankruptcy on october  as a result of the bankruptcy of lehman brothers and its parent company  lehman brothers holdings  inc  on september   lehman brothers elected not to fund its pro rata share  or  of borrowings requested by us under the facility 
although we do not currently expect this reduced availability of amounts under the senior credit facility to impact our liquidity or business operations  the inability of one or more of our other lenders to fund their obligations under the facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed and variable interest rate borrowings 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to i changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and ii the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
variable rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates as our interest obligations on these instruments are periodically redetermined based on prevailing market interest rates  primarily libor and the federal funds rate 
we use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that market risk exposures may have on our variable interest rate borrowings 
based on the million outstanding balance of our senior floating rate notes at december   a one percent change in the applicable rates  with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a change in our interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  in addition to commodity price derivative arrangements  we may enter into derivative transactions to fix the interest we pay on a portion of the money we borrow under our credit agreement 
in january  we entered into a 
table of contents million notional amount interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution that effectively fixed our interest rate on the variable rate term loan for the period from april  through april  as a result of the exchange of the variable rate term loan to senior floating rate notes  the interest rate swap is being used to fix the variable libor interest rate on the senior floating rate notes at through april this swap has not been designated as a hedge 
an unrealized loss of million was recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the change in fair value of the interest rate swap for the year ended december
