additional insurance coverage is also available through union s participation in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars of promontory interfinancial network 
consistent with the objective of the company to serve the needs of individuals  businesses and others within the communities served  the company seeks to concentrate its assets in loans

to be consistent with the requirements of prudent banking practices  adequate assets are invested in high grade securities to provide liquidity  diversification of income sources and safety 
see discussion of financial condition in part ii item  md a and incorporated herein by reference  for information on the composition of union s investment portfolio by type and maturity as well as other sources of liquidity 
the risk of nonpayment or deferred payment of loans is inherent in commercial banking 
the company s marketing focus on individuals and small to medium sized businesses results in the assumption by it of certain lending risks 
management carefully evaluates all loan applications and attempts to minimize credit risk exposure by the use of uniform loan underwriting guidelines  approval and monitoring procedures  however  there can be no assurance that such measures will entirely reduce such lending risks 
see risk factors in part ii item md a and incorporated herein by reference for additional information about the risks inherent in the company s business 
source of business management believes that the market segments targeted  individuals  small to medium sized businesses  and municipalities in the company s market area  demand the convenience and personal service that a smaller  independent financial institution can offer 
it is these themes of convenience and personal service that form the basis of the company s business development strategies 
at december   union maintained branch offices and atms  and also provided many of its services via the telephone and the internet 
management s operational strategy includes continued evaluation of changing market needs and design and implementation of products and services to meet those needs  as well as the establishment and maintenance of necessary infrastructure necessary to deliver those products and services effectively and efficiently 
measures taken by management in recent years to implement this approach have included the expansion to a full service branch location in littleton  new hampshire in march  the introduction of a new  more competitive small business checking account  the introduction of tiered variable rate certificates of deposit which also allow additional deposits and limited withdrawals  and the addition of another atm location 
strategies for included the expansion of the company s main office  the announcement of two additional branch locations in danville and st 
albans  vermont which were completed in  the installation of new platform software to streamline new deposit processing  document imaging  check imaging  and a new internal computer network 
strategies for in addition to the completion of the two aforementioned branches were the addition of remote item capture at all branches  the addition in the trust services division of another experienced officer  the addition of new avenues to sell loans via the fhlb of boston mortgage partnership finance program  the strengthening of relationships with other local financial institutions to be able to share services or participate loans to  the introduction of health savings and electronic virtua accounts  the introduction of the greenlend energy efficiency and renewable energy loan programs  the outsourcing of the company s transfer agent responsibilities to provide shareholders with book entry securities and online access to their investor information  and a successful effort to take adv antage of the new technologies implemented to promote internal efficiencies which resulted in a decrease in the number of full time equivalent employees during despite the addition of two new branch locations 
strategies for include increasing visibility of the company and its services in the two communities where branches were opened in the second half of  reviewing the profitability of branch and atm locations as well as exploring expansion opportunities  evaluating the offering of remote deposit capture to commercial customers  and continuing to closely monitor credit and interest rate risk given the current state of the financial markets and the economy 
the directors and management of the company intend to continue to offer products and services that will allow the company to manage responsibly the growth of its assets  while building and enhancing stockholder value  preserving union bank s image as a premier vermont community bank and building that reputation in the northern new ham pshire market 
the company seeks to capitalize upon the extensive business and personal contacts and relationships of its directors  advisory board members and officers to continue to develop the company s customer base  as well as relying on director and advisory board referrals  officer originated calling programs and customer and shareholder referrals 
two regional advisory boards in littleton  new hampshire and st 
albans  vermont have been added in recent years to assist with the company s continuing growth in those geographic areas 
competition the company and union face substantial competition for loans and deposits in their market area from local commercial banks  savings banks  tax exempt credit unions  mortgage brokers  and financial services affiliates of bank holding companies  as well as from national financial service providers such as mutual funds  brokerage houses  insurance companies  consumer finance companies and internet banks 
within the company s market area are branches of several commercial and savings banks that are substantially larger than the company 
union focuses on its community banking niche and on providing convenient locations  hours and modes of delivery to provide superior customer service 
we have seen over the last four months of and continuing into  a trend by customers to turn to local community banks to fulfill their financial needs with organizations and people they know and trust 
we are hopeful that this trend will continue 
in order to compete with the larger financial institutions in its service area  union capitalizes on the flexibility and local autonomy which is accorded by its independent status 
this includes an emphasis on personal service  timely decision making  local promotional activity  and personal contacts and community service by union s officers  directors and employees 
the company strives to educate the public about the strength of the company and the local economy in light of the national and global problems in the real estate and financial markets 
the company competes for checking  savings  money market accounts and other deposits by offering depositors competitive products and rates  personal service  local area expertise  convenient locations and access  and an array of financial services and products 
deposit specials offered by local and national competitors as well as the variety of nonbanking investment avenues open to our customers and the public can make deposit growth challenging 
the competition in originating real estate and other loans comes principally from commercial banks  savings banks  mortgage banking companies and credit unions 
the company competes for loan originations primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges  the types of loans it offers  and the efficiency and quality of services it provides 
in addition to residential mortgage lending and municipal loans  the company also emphasizes commercial real estate  construction  and both conventional and sba guaranteed commercial lending 
factors that affect the company s ability to compete for loans include general and local economic conditions  prevailing interest rates including the prime rate  and pricing volatility of the secondary loan markets 
the company promotes an increased level of personal service and expertise within the community to position itself as a lender to small to middle market business and residential customers  which tend to be under served by larger institutions 
the company competes for personal and institutional trust business with trust companies  commercial banks having trust departments  investment advisory firms  brokerage firms  mutual funds and insurance companies 
the competitive environment for financial institutions has undergone significant change in recent years see financial services modernization below but the company anticipates a significant scale back of the powers granted to various financial institutions given the meltdown in the financial markets over the last few months 
it is unfortunate that banks are being blamed for many of the problems as a community banking organization like union bankshares  which engages in traditional banking activities  differs markedly from the large international financial organizations that engage in risky financial activities and that may have a retail bank as part of their portfolio of companies 
the company and it s officers will continue to be active members of the communities we serve and strong advocates for community banks and the safety and soundness of these institutions 
tax exempt credit unions are becoming an increasingly significant source of competition 
credit union common bond requirements and the definition of a credit union member have been interpreted liberally by federal and state credit union regulators while at the same time  the scope of products credit unions are permitted to offer has steadily expanded  resulting in greater penetration of this tax advantaged segment of the financial services industry into traditional banking markets 
in february of  the sba expanded the eligibility of certain lenders programs to include all credit unions 
in addition  during  vermont s credit union statute was comprehensively updated  granting state chartered credit unions significantly expanded powers to offer financial products and services beyond those traditionally offered by credit unions 
competitive change is also occurring due to rapid technological advances which increasingly permit the delivery of financial products and services without the need for a physical presence in the market area served and which also are likely to diminish the importance of traditional bricks and mortar in market presence and reduce the role of financial intermediaries  such as banks  in the transfer of funds between parties 
as a result  the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to address customers needs by using technology 
recent developments the us and global economies have experienced and are experiencing significant stress and disruptions in the financial sector 
dramatic slowdowns in the housing industry with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment have resulted in major issues for some financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and investment banks 
these issues have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
despite the volatile economy  vermont has the lowest residential foreclosure rate in the country 
also  as northern new england had not experienced the dramatic run up in housing prices  likewise  we have not seen the values drop as far as other parts of the country 
in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking and financial markets  in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the federal deposit insurance corporation temporarily increased the deposit insurance coverage limits to  per ownership category at each insured financial institution until december  also  the us treasury the treasury was granted the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets under the troubled asset purchase program the tarp 
in addition  the treasury has been authorized to purchase equity stakes in us financial institutions 
under this program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp capital purchase program  from the billion authorized by the eesa  the treasury is authorized to invest up to billion of capital in us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock and common stock warrants 
participating publicly held financial institutions are required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under the tarp capital purchase program and are restricted from increasing dividends to common shareholders or repurchasing common stock for three years without the consent of the treasury 
further  after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve system the frb  the treasury signed the systemic risk exception to the fdic act  enabling the fdic to temporarily provide a guarantee of the senior unsecured debt of all fdic insured institutions and their holding companies  as well as of deposits in noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts under a temporary liquidity guarantee program 
coverage under the temporary liquidity guarantee program was available for days without charge and thereafter at a cost of basis points per annum for senior unsecured debt and basis points per annum for noninterest bearing transaction deposits in excess of the  insured deposit limit 
the company made a decision to participate in the temporary liquidity guarantee program regarding the noninterest bearing deposit account guarantee but to opt out of the senior unsecured debt guaranty portion of that program 
the company also decided it was not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders to participate in either the troubled asset purchase program or the capital purchase program available under tarp given the strength of the company s capital position  the nature of the government restrictions with the possibility of additional restrictions in the future  and the fact that the company did not target sub prime borrowers 
on february   the secretary of the treasury announced a new comprehensive financial stability plan the financial stability plan  authorized under the eesa 
the major elements of the financial stability plan include i a capital assistance program that will invest in convertible preferred stock of certain qualifying institutions  ii a consumer and business lending initiative to fund new consumer loans  small business loans and commercial mortgage asset backed securities issuances  iii a new public private investment fund that will leverage public and private capital with public financing to purchase up to billion to trillion of legacy toxic assets from financial institutions  and iv assistance for homeowners to reduce mortgage payments and interest rates and establishing loan modification guidelines for government and private programs 
in addition  all banking institutions with assets over billion will be required to un dergo a comprehensive stress test to determine if they have sufficient capital to continue lending and to absorb losses that could result from a more severe decline in the economy than projected 
institutions receiving assistance under the financial stability plan going forward will be subject to higher transparency and accountability standards  including restrictions on dividends  acquisitions and executive compensation and additional disclosure requirements 
the fdic adopted a revised  risk based assessment system to determine assessment rates to be paid by member institutions  such as union 
under this revised assessment system  risk is defined and measured using an institution s supervisory ratings  combined with certain other risk measures  including certain financial ratios and long term debt issuer ratings 
the annual risk based assessment rates for ranged from to per of insured deposits 
the annual risk based assessment rates for were from to for the first quarter and have been set to to for the second quarter 
the fdic also has introduced three adjustments that could be made to an institution s initial base assessment rate starting in the second quarter of i a potential decrease for long term unsecured debt  including senior and subordinated debt and  for smaller institutions  a portion of tier capital  a potential increase for secured liabiliti es above a threshold amount  and for non risk category institutions  a potential increase for brokered deposits above a threshold amount 
in addition  the fdic announced a special assessment of up to basis points to be assessed on deposits at june  and collected on september  the fdic may also impose an emergency special assessment after june  up to basis points if the fdic deems that an additional special assessment is necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
union bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system  which consists of regional federal home loan banks 
the federal home loan bank fhlb provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
members of the fhlb are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb in an amount at least equal to of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loan and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  or of its advances borrowings from the fhlb  whichever is greater 
union bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in fhlb of boston fhlbb stock at december  of million 
at december   union bank had million outstanding fhlbb advances 
the federal home loan banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes  including the resolution of insolvent thrifts in the late s  and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the federal home loan banks pay to their members and result in the federal home loan banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members 
if dividends were reduced  or interest on future fhlb advances increased  a member bank affected by such reduction or increase would likely experience a reduction in its net interest income 
legislation has changed the structure of the federal home loan banks funding obligations for insolvent thrifts  revised the capital structure of the federal home loan banks and implemented entirely voluntary membership for federal home loan banks 
in late  the fhlbb increased its retained earnings target in light of ongoing market volatility 
in early  the co mpany was notified that the fhlbb had reaffirmed its late announcement placing a moratorium on excess stock repurchases and suspended its dividend for the first quarter of the fhlbb further noted that there exists considerable uncertainty about the amount of future fhlbb dividend payouts 
for and  cash dividends from the fhlbb to union bank amounted to thousand and thousand  respectively 
there can be no assurance that these recent announcements and actions by the fhlbb will not cause a decrease in the value of the fhlbb stock held by union bank 
it is not clear at this time what impact the eesa  the tarp capital purchase program  the temporary liquidity guarantee program  other liquidity and funding initiatives of the frb  the fdic  and other agencies that have been previously announced  and any additional programs that may be initiated in the future will have on the company and the us and global financial markets 
regulation and supervision the following discussion describes certain material elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain information specific to the company 
this regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  and not for the protection of security holders 
to the extent that this information describes statutory and regulatory provisions  it is qualified in its entirety by reference to those provisions 
as a vermont chartered commercial bank  union is subject to regulation  examination  and supervision by the vermont banking department and the fdic 
regular examinations of union by the vermont banking department and the fdic include examination of the bank s financial condition and operations  including but not limited to its capital adequacy  loan reserves  loans  investments  earnings  liquidity  compliance with laws and regulations  record of performance under the federal community reinvestment act of  as amended cra as well as under the bank secrecy act  and the performance of its management 
in addition the company  as a registered one bank holding company  is subject to regulation  examination and supervision by the frb 
the company is also under the jurisdiction of the securities and exchange commission sec for matters relating to the offering and sale of its securities as well as investor reporting requirements 
the company is subject to restrictions  reporting requirements and review procedures under federal securities laws and regulations 
the company s common stock is listed on the nasdaq stock market llc nasdaq under the trading symbol unb and accordingly  the company is subject to the rules of nasdaq for listed companies 
the regulations of these authorities govern certain of the operations of the company and its subsidiary 
the following discussion summarizes the material aspects of various material federal and state banking laws and regulations that apply to the company and union 
this summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations 
federal reserve board policies and reserve requirements 
the monetary policies and regulations of the frb have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
frb policies affect the levels of bank earnings on loans and investments and the levels of interest paid on bank deposits through the federal reserve system s open market operations in united states government securities  regulation of the discount rate on bank borrowings from federal reserve banks and regulation of non earning reserve requirements 
regulation d promulgated by the frb requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts generally  demand deposits  now accounts and certain other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties and non personal time deposits generally  money market deposit accounts or other savings deposits held by corporations or other depositors that are not natural persons  and certain other types of time deposits  subject to certain exemptions 
as of december   union s reserve requirement was approximately thousand which was satisfied by vault cash 
bank holding company acquisitions and activities 
as a bank holding company  the company is subject to supervision and regulation by the frb under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhc act 
under the bhc act  the activities of bank holding companies  such as union bankshares  and those of companies that they control  such as union  or in which they hold more than of the voting stock  are limited to banking  managing or controlling banks  furnishing services to or performing services for their subsidiaries  or certain activities that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking  managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
as described below  a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company under the federal gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of gramm leach bliley act may engage in certain additional activities 
bank holding c ompanies such as union bankshares that have not elected to become financial holding companies  are required to obtain the prior approval of the frb to engage in any new activity or to acquire more than of any class of voting stock of any bank or other company 
satisfactory capital ratios  cra ratings and anti money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions 
the frb has authority to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or terminate unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulations and to assess civil money penalties against bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and other affiliates 
the frb also has the authority to remove officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties 
the frb has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity  or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary  when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness  or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company 
the frb has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices 
the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses the frb s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
financial services modernization 
the gramm leach bliley act permits eligible bank holding companies to elect to become financial holding companies and thereby engage in a broader range of financial and other activities than is permitted to bank holding companies generally 
under the gramm leach bliley act  a financial holding company may engage in activities that are not traditionally encompassed within the business of banking but that are financial in nature  including securities underwriting  dealing and market making  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting  merchant banking and additional activities that the frb  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines to be financial in nature  or incident or complementary to such financial activities  provided that such activities do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the gramm leach bliley act effectively permits the integration  under a financial holding company umbrella  of firms engaged in banking  insurance and securities activities  and preempts state laws that purport to limit or prohibit such affiliations 
no regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company  other than a bank or savings association  engaged in permitted activities 
in order to become a financial holding company  all of the bank holding company s bank subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed under applicable regulatory guidelines  and each of such banks must have been rated satisfactory or better in its most recent evaluation under the federal cra 
once a bank holding company has elected to be treated as a financial holding company  it may face significant consequences if it subsequently fails to meet one or more of the criteria for eligibility 
for example  it may be required to enter into an agreement with the frb imposing limitations on its operations and requiring divestitures 
in addition  the need to maintain eligibility could hamper a financial holding company s ability to expand or to acquire financial institutions that do not meet the required criteria 
as of the date of this report  the company had not elected to become a financial holding company 
source of strength 
under frb policy  bank holding companies  such as union bankshares inc  are required to act as a source of financial and management strength to their subsidiary banks  such as union  and to commit resources to support them 
this support may be called for at times when a bank holding company may not have the required resources to do so 
interstate banking 
under the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of an adequately capitalized and managed bank holding company is permitted to acquire banks based outside its home state  generally without regard to whether the state s law would permit the acquisition 
this act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches 
in addition  this act permits banks to acquire existing interstate branches short of merger or to establish new interstate branches 
states were given the right  exercisable before june   to prohibit altogether or impose certain limitations on interstate mergers and the acquisition or establishment of interstate branches 
none of the states contiguous to vermont new hampshire  new york and massachusetts has in effect any statute which would substantially impede the ability of a vermont bank to acquire or create interstate branches directly or through an interstate me rger 
similarly  vermont law does not limit the ability of out of state banks to acquire or create branches in vermont 
although interstate banking and branching may result in increased competitive pressures in the markets in which the company operates  interstate branching may also present competitive opportunities for locally owned and managed banks  such as union  that are familiar with the local markets and that emphasize personal service and prompt  local decision making 
the ability to branch interstate has also benefited union  as it has permitted the expansion of its banking operations into new hampshire  with the opening of a branch in littleton in march of affiliate restrictions 
bank holding companies and their affiliates are subject to certain restrictions under the federal reserve act in their dealings with each other  such as in connection with extensions of credit  transfers of assets  and purchase of services among affiliated parties 
generally  loans or extensions of credit  issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit  investments or purchases of assets by a subsidiary bank from a bank holding company or its affiliates are limited to of the bank s capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations with respect to each affiliate and to in the aggregate for all affiliates  and borrowings are also subject to certain collateral requirements 
these transactions  as well as other transactions between a subsidiary bank and its holding company or other affiliates must generally be on arms length terms  that is  on terms comparable to those involving nonaffiliated companies 
further  under the federal reserve act and frb regulations  a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit or lease or sale of property  furnishing of property or services to third parties 
the company and union are subject to these restrictions in their intercompany transactions 
bank 
the various laws and regulations applicable to union that are administered by the fdic and the vermont banking commissioner affect union s corporate practices  such as payment of dividends  incurring of debt and acquisition of financial institutions and other companies 
these laws also affect its business practices  such as payment of interest on deposits  guidelines on concentrations in commercial real estate lending  limitations on loans to one borrower  the charging of interest on loans  privacy issues and the location of offices 
if  as a result of an examination of the bank  the fdic should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory  or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulations  various remedies are available to the fdic 
such remedies include the power to enjoin un safe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict the growth of the bank  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  and ultimately to terminate the bank s deposit insurance 
the vermont department of banking has many of the same remedial powers 
there are no outstanding regulatory orders resulting from regulatory examinations of the company or union 
dividend limitations 
as a holding company  the company s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders is largely dependent on the ability of its subsidiary to pay dividends to it 
payment of dividends by vermont chartered banks  such as union  is subject to applicable state and federal laws 
under vermont banking laws  a vermont chartered bank may not authorize dividends or other distributions which would reduce the bank s capital below the amount of capital required in the bank s certificate of general good or under any capital or surplus standards established by the vermont banking commissioner 
union does not have any capital restrictions in its certificate of general good and  to date  the vermont banking commissioner has not adopted capital or surplus standards 
nevertheless  the capital standards established by the fdic  described below under capital requirements  apply to union  and the capital standards of the frb apply to the company on a consolidated basis 
in addition  the frb  the fdic and the vermont banking commissioner are authorized under applicable federal and state laws to prohibit payment of dividends that they determine would be an unsafe or unsound practice 
payment of dividends that deplete the capital of a bank or a bank holding company  or render it illiquid  could be found to be an unsafe or unsound practice 
loans to related parties 
the company s and union s authority to extend credit to their directors  executive officers and percent stockholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of the federal reserve act and regulation o of the frb thereunder 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders i be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and ii not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based in part  on the amount of the bank s capital 
under nasdaq guidelines  any related party transaction including loans must b e reviewed by the company s audit committee 
in addition  under the federal sarbanes oxley act of discussed below  the company  itself  may not extend or arrange for any personal loans to its directors and executive officers 
the company has a related persons transactions approval policy which incorporates applicable regulatory guidelines and requirements and is administered by the company s board of directors 
capital adequacy guidelines 
the frb  the fdic and other federal banking regulators have issued substantially similar risk based and leverage capital guidelines for united states banking organizations 
those regulatory agencies are also authorized to require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels  whether because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth 
the frb s risk based capital guidelines define a three tier capital framework and specify three relevant capital ratios tier capital ratio  a total capital ratio and a leverage ratio 
tier capital consists of common and qualifying preferred shareholders equity  plus or minus certain intangibles and other adjustments 
the remainder tier and tier capital consists of subordinate and other qualifying debt  preferred stock that does not qualify as tier capital  and the allowance of credit losses up to of risk weighted assets 
the sum of tier  tier and tier capital  less investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries  represents qualifying total capital  at least of which must consist of tier capital 
risk based capital ratios are calculated by dividing tier capital and total capital by risk weighted assets 
assets and off balance sheet exposures are assigned to one of four categories or risk weights  based primarily on relative credit risk 
the minimum tier capital ratio is and the minimum total capital ratio is 
the leverage ratio is determined by dividing tier capital by adjusted average total assets 
although the minimum leverage ratio is  most banking organizations are required to maintain leverage ratios of at least to percentage points above 
a financial institution s failure to meet minimum regulatory capital standards can lead to other penalties  including termination of deposit insurance or appointment of a conservator or receiver for the financial institution 
risk based capital ratios are the primary measure of regulatory capital presently applicable to bank holding companies 
risk based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
federal bank regulatory agencies require banking organizations that engage in significant trading activity to calculate a capital charge for market risk 
significant trading activity means trading activity of at least of total assets or billion  whichever is smaller  calculated on a consolidated basis for bank holding companies 
federal bank regulators may apply the market risk measure to other bank holding companies  as the agency deems necessary or appropriate for safe and sound banking practices 
each agency may exclude organizations that it supervises that otherwise meet the criteria under certain circumstances 
the market risk charge will be included in the calculation of an organization s risk based capital ratio 
neither the company nor union is currently subject to this special capital charge 
frb policy provides that banking organizations generally  and  in particular  those that are experiencing rapid internal growth or actively making acquisitions  will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets  such as goodwill 
furthermore  the capital guidelines indicate that the frb will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the tangible tier leverage ratio is calculated by dividing a banking organization s tier capital less all intangible assets by its total consolidated quarterly average assets less all intangible assets 
the frb s capital adequacy guidelines generally provide that bank holding companies with a ratio of intangible assets to tangible tier capital in excess of will be subject to close scrutiny for certain purposes  including the frb s evaluation of acquisition proposals 
the company does not have a material amount of intangibles in its capital base 
the frb s capital adequacy guidelines exempt certain small bank holding companies from its risk based capital requirements 
although the company meets the consolidated assets test of under million  it does not qualify for this regulatory relief because it does not meet the separate requirement that the small bank holding company not have a material amount of its securities registered with the securities and exchange commission 
at december   the company s consolidated total and tier i risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  and its leverage capital ratio was  and it is considered well capitalized under the above regulatory guidelines 
in addition  union is considered well capitalized under such guidelines 
prompt corrective action 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal banking agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations  management and capital distributions  depending on the category in which an institution is classified 
failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements 
an undercapitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding compa ny must guarantee that bank s compliance with the plan 
the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of of the bank s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan 
furthermore  in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company  such guarantee would take priority over the parent s general unsecured creditors 
in addition  fdicia requires the various federal banking agencies to prescribe certain noncapital standards for safety and soundness related generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation  and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards 
the various federal banking agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by fdicia  using the total capital  tier ratio and the leverage ratio as the relevant capital measures
