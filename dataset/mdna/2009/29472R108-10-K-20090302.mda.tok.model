item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
accomplishments acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of privileged access for an unsecured note payable of million 
raised annual dividend to per share in  up from per share in paid off maturing mortgages totaling approximately million  funded with approximately million of new and refinanced debt on properties 
overview and outlook occupancy in our properties as well as our ability to increase rental rates directly affects revenues 
our revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting our sites on a long term basis 
we have approximately  annual sites  approximately  seasonal sites  which are leased to customers generally for three to six months  and approximately  transient sites  occupied by customers who lease sites on a short term basis 
the revenue from seasonal and transient sites is generally higher during the first and third quarters 
we expect to service over  customers at our transient sites and we consider this revenue stream to be our most volatile 
it is subject to weather conditions  gas prices  and other factors affecting the marginal rv customer s vacation and travel preferences 
finally  we have approximately  sites designated as right to use sites which are utilized to service the approximately  customers who own right to use contracts 
we also have interests in properties containing approximately  sites for which revenue is classified as equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations 
total sites as of dec 
 rounded to s community sites resort sites annual seasonal transient right to use joint ventures includes sites from discontinued operations for each of the years ending december  and joint venture income is included in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 

table of contents our home sales volumes and gross profits have been declining since we believe that the disruption in the site built housing market may be contributing to the decline in our home sales operations as potential customers are not able to sell their existing site built homes as well as increased price sensitivity for seasonal and second homebuyers 
we believe that our potential customers are also having difficulty obtaining financing on resort homes  resort cottages and rv purchases 
the continued decline in homes sales activity in has resulted in our decision to significantly reduce our new home sales operation during the last couple months of and until such time as new home sales markets improve 
we believe that renting our vacant new homes may represent an attractive source of occupancy and potentially convert to a new homebuyer in the future 
we also believe that some customers that are capable of purchasing are opting instead to rent due to the current economic environment 
one trend emerging in in light of the economic environment was simplification in both financial and social interactions 
we have adjusted our business to respond to our customers desire to spend more wisely and preserve capital while still engaging in an active and vibrant lifestyle 
these changes include new membership and affinity products in our resort properties and a focus on smaller  more energy efficient and more affordable homes in our manufactured home properties 
we have also adjusted our business model with the introduction of low cost internet and alternate distribution channels that focus on the installed base of almost eight million rv owners 
rv manufacturers and dealers experienced the second year of declining volumes in with current monthly activity reflecting precipitous declines over the prior year 
availability of financing for both floor plan inventory and retail customers has been severely constrained and there is little hope for improvement in although industry experts are predicting shipments of approximately  rv units in  down from the estimated  in  the current annualized run rate is less than  units 
as with the decline experienced by the manufactured home industry  the remaining participants survival depends on their ability to react to the new environment 
we believe that the aggregate demand for housing in will be negatively impacted by job losses  economic uncertainty and dislocation in the credit markets  while the huge overhang of supply would continue to negatively impact pricing of both for sale and for rent housing 
with this backdrop we believe will present more challenges than  however  we also believe we are well positioned to continue delivering stable performance 
in response to recent market disruptions  legislators and financial regulators implemented a number of mechanisms designed to add stability to the financial markets  including the provision of direct and indirect assistance to distressed financial institutions  assistance by the banking authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker dealers  implementation of programs by the federal reserve to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets and temporary prohibitions on short sales of certain financial institution securities 
on october   the then president of the united states signed into law the eesa 
the eesa provided the us secretary of treasury with the authority to establish tarp  to purchase from financial institutions up to billion of residential or commercial mortgages and any securities  obligations  or other instruments that are based on  or related to  such mortgages  that in each case was originated or issued on or before march   as well as any other financial instrument that the us secretary of treasury  after consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability  upon transmittal of such determination  in writing  to the appropriate committees of the us congress 
in addition  the us secretary of treasury has the authority to establish a program to guarantee  upon request from a financial institution  the timely payment of principal and interest on these financial assets 
as of february   the us treasury had announced the establishment of the cpp  the tip  the ssfip  the agp and the aifp under tarp as well as the hasp which partially uses tarp money 
the cpp is a voluntary program designed to encourage us financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers and to support the us economy 
under this program  the us treasury is authorized to purchase up to billion of senior preferred shares in qualifying domestically controlled banks  savings associations  and certain bank and savings and loan holding companies engaged only in financial activities 
as of february   the us treasury had invested approximately billion in publicly traded and private banking organizations under the cpp 
the tip is intended to prevent significant 
table of contents market disruptions that could result from a loss of confidence in a particular financial institution 
the us treasury will determine whether a financial institution is eligible for the program on a case by case basis 
as of february   the us treasury had invested billion in two banking organizations under the tip 
the ssfip is intended to provide stability and prevent disruption to financial markets that could result from the failure of a systemically significant institution 
the us treasury will consider whether an institution is systemically significant and at substantial risk of failure  and thereby eligible for the ssfip  on a case by case basis 
as of february   the us treasury had invested billion in one institution under the ssfip  an insurance company  however  banks are also eligible for the ssfip 
the agp is designed to provide guarantees for assets held by systemically significant financial institutions that face a high risk of losing market confidence due in large part to a portfolio of distressed or illiquid assets 
the us treasury will determine the eligibility of participants and the allocation of resources on a case by case basis 
in a report to congress  the us treasury stated that it may use this program in coordination with a broader guarantee involving one or more other us government agencies 
as of february   the us treasury had invested under the agp 
the hasp is intended to offer assistance to homeowners who are making a good faith effort to stay current on their mortgage payments and is designed to prevent the destructive impact of foreclosures on families and communities

the us treasury will determine the eligibility of participants and the allocation of resources on a case by case basis 
as of february   the us treasury had invested billion in two automotive companies and two financing companies that  among other business lines  provide consumer automotive loans 
on february   president obama signed the arra into law  which is more commonly known as the economic stimulus or economic recovery package 
arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients  that are in addition to those previously announced by the us treasury  until the institution has repaid the us treasury  which is now permitted under arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the us treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
on july   the hope for homeowners act of hh act  became law 
pursuant to the hh act  a new  temporary  voluntary program within the federal housing administration  fha  was enacted to support fha insured mortgages to distressed borrowers 
this program  which is effective from october  to september   is intended to enable certain distressed borrowers to refinance their mortgages into fha insured loans 
in  the federal reserve also initiated a number of other programs for the purpose of improving the broader financial markets including establishing a trillion commercial paper funding facility and a billion facility to finance consumer asset backed securities 
further  in an effort to provide additional liquidity to financial institutions  the federal reserve has provided primary dealers with access to the federal reserve s discount window and  in a limited number of cases  arranged financing for certain holding entities 
for example  american international group  a large new york based insurance company  accepted a loan of more than billion from the federal reserve bank of new york to avoid insolvency 
on november   the federal reserve announced that it will purchase billion in direct obligations of fannie mae  freddie mac and the federal home loan banks and billion in mortgage backed securities backed by fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae 
the federal reserve stated that it is taking such action with the expectation that its investments will reduce the cost and increase availability of credit for residential mortgages  thereby supporting the general residential housing market and  in turn  the overall financial markets 
the purchases of direct obligations began during the first week of december during  the fdic also initiated programs in an effort to restore confidence and functioning in the banking system and attempt to reduce foreclosures through loan modifications 
specifically  the fdic adopted 
table of contents the temporary liquidity guarantee program  which has two primary components the debt guarantee program  by which the fdic will guarantee the payment of certain newly issued senior unsecured debt  and the transaction account guarantee program  by which the fdic will guarantee up to an unlimited amount certain transaction accounts bearing no or minimal interest eg now accounts paying no more than interest  until december  the fdic also raised the deposit insurance limits to  up from  through december  additionally  in an effort to reduce the number of residential foreclosures  the fdic encouraged the creation and adoption of uniform guidelines for loan modifications which include interest rate reduction  maturity extension and principal reduction 
the overall effects of these and other legislative and regulatory efforts on the financial markets is uncertain  and they may not have the intended stabilization effects 
should these or other legislative or regulatory initiatives fail to stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
even if legislative or regulatory initiatives or other efforts successfully stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets  we may need to modify our strategies  businesses or operations  and we may incur increased capital requirements and constraints or additional costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment 
it is uncertain what effects recently enacted or future legislation or regulatory initiatives will have on us 
given the volatile nature of the current market disruption and the uncertainties underlying efforts to mitigate or reverse the disruption  we may not timely anticipate or manage existing  new or additional risks  contingencies or developments  including regulatory developments and trends in new products and services  in the current or future environment 
our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo  as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
ffo is defined as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company receives up front non refundable payments from the sale of right to use contracts 
in accordance with gaap  the upfront non refundable payments and related commissions are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer life 
although the nareit definition of ffo does not address the treatment of nonrefundable right to use payments  the company believes that it is appropriate to adjust for the impact of the deferral activity in our calculation of ffo 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
the company further believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
the company believes that the adjustment to ffo for the net revenue deferral of upfront non refundable payments and expense deferral of right to use contract commissions also facilitates the comparison to other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
the company computes ffo in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates 
the primary market risk we face is long term indebtedness  which bears interest at fixed and variable rates 
the fair value of our long term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates

for each increase in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
for each decrease in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
at december   approximately or approximately million of our outstanding debt was short term and at variable rates 
earnings are affected by increases and decreases in market interest rates on this debt
