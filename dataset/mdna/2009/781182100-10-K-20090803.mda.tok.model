item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ruby tuesday  inc  including its wholly owned subsidiaries rti  the company  we and or our  owns and operates ruby tuesday casual dining restaurants 
we also franchise the ruby tuesday concept in selected domestic and international markets 
our mission is to be the best of the bar grill sector of the restaurant industry by delivering to our guests a high quality casual dining experience with compelling value 
our restaurants operate in the higher end of the bar and grill segment of casual dining 
as of june   we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants  located in states and the district of columbia 
we also own or of the equity of each of domestic franchisees  with the balance of the equity in these franchisees being owned by the various operators of the franchise businesses 
as of year end  these franchisees  which we refer to as franchise partnerships  operated restaurants

our other franchisees operated domestic and international restaurants 
in total  our franchisees operate restaurants in states  puerto rico  guam  and foreign countries 
in addition  we operate two wok hay full service asian restaurants 
the company owned and operated restaurants are concentrated primarily in the northeast  southeast  mid atlantic and midwest regions of the united states 
we consider these regions to be our core markets 
our fiscal year ends on the first tuesday following may and  as is the case once every five or six years  we have a week year 
fiscal years  and each contained weeks 
references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor s understanding of the franchise system  including franchise partnerships and traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenue is not included in  and is not  revenue of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in certain cases  support service income and equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated franchises 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor 
overview and strategies casual dining  the segment of the industry in which we operate  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  convenience  locations  and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer the same or similar types of services and products as we do 
in  our analysis of the bar and grill segment within casual dining indicated that many concepts  including ruby tuesday  were not clearly differentiated 
we believed that as the segment continued to mature  the lack of differentiation would make it increasingly difficult to attract new guests 
consequently  we created brand reimaging initiatives to implement our strategy of clearly differentiating ruby tuesday from our competitors  as discussed under the caption operations included earlier in this annual report 
we implemented our strategy in stages  first focusing on food  then service  and in  we embarked on the most capital intensive aspect of our reimaging program the creation of a fresh new look for our restaurants 
we believe that ruby tuesday  as a result of these initiatives  is well positioned for the future 
while we were in the process of implementing our brand reimaging  consumer spending came under pressure for a variety of reasons  and further weakened in the fourth quarter of calendar as the economic environment deteriorated  operating results for other casual dining concepts  as well as our operating results  declined significantly 
in response  in the second half of fiscal  we implemented several initiatives intended to enhance our sales  reduce costs and improve cash flow  including the following sales initiatives 
our sales initiatives aim to increase guest traffic by focusing primarily on two areas  menu and marketing 
the menu emphasizes high quality and compelling value 
for example  our burgers now include endless fries  the majority of our specialties and premium seafood items offer a complete meal for typically less than and we offer meals for under through independently conducted studies  we regularly measure our guests perception of our menu offerings and will make item modifications to enhance their value proposition if necessary 
our new brand image allows us to credibly offer higher end limited time menu items  such as lobster tails  which we believe allow us to better leverage our fixed costs and further differentiate our brand from our traditional competitors 
we shifted our marketing strategy to more effectively communicate our brand and value message 
we broadened our strategy to encompass four pillars print media  promotion  internet  and local market programs 
part of our emphasis is greater promotional activity  with a local market focus  that is intended to address the current importance of price in consumers perception of value 
we are also evaluating programs to increase sales during off peak times 
cost savings 
in the second half of fiscal  we implemented initiatives designed to result in substantial cost savings 
these cost savings are a result of labor initiatives  including new scheduling systems and the realignment of field supervisors  which are expected to account for approximately one half of the savings  while disciplined food cost management  improved operating efficiencies and the closing of the underperforming restaurants are expected to account for the remainder 
we estimate that these initiatives resulted in cost savings of approximately million in the second half of fiscal furthermore  lower management and labor turnover during fiscal compared to fiscal not only reduced training costs  but also resulted in a more experienced work force and improved customer service 
restaurant closings 
during our second quarter of fiscal we conducted an analysis of all our company operated restaurants based on profitability  brand image  location  and other factors and identified restaurants to close  of which we closed in the third quarter of fiscal the remaining are to be closed over the next several years as their leases expire 
generate free cash flow and improve our balance sheet 
because of our leverage  we are highly focused on maximizing our cash flow and paying our debt 
if we are successful in stabilizing same restaurant sales and maintaining or lowering our costs  we have the opportunity to maintain substantial levels of free cash flow 
furthermore  our near term capital requirements are relatively modest as we don t anticipate opening any new ruby tuesday restaurants in fiscal  and our maintenance capital spending needs are low because we have remodeled virtually all the company owned restaurants within the last two years 
we define free cash flow to be the net amount remaining when purchases of property and equipment are subtracted from net cash provided by operating activities 
we generated million of free cash flow in fiscal  all of which was dedicated to the reduction of debt 
we anticipate total capital spending in fiscal to be to million 
we also estimate we will generate million to million of free cash flow in fiscal  a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to the reduction of debt 
similarly  we intend to use free cash flow generated in the next few years following fiscal to reduce debt 
our objective is to reduce debt as quickly as possible to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce the financial risk related to our leverage 
as another means of reducing our bank debt and strengthening our balance sheet  on july   we closed an underwritten public offering of million shares of ruby tuesday  inc common stock  as further discussed in the financing activities section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
our same restaurant sales for company owned restaurants declined and our diluted earnings per share declined in fiscal largely as a result of charges related to restaurant closures and impairments and goodwill impairment  the majority of which were non cash 
throughout this md a  we discuss our fiscal financial results in detail  provide insight for fiscal years and  as well as discuss known events  uncertainties and trends 
we hope our commentary provides insight as to the factors which impacted our performance 
we remind you  that  in order to best obtain an understanding of our financial performance during the last three fiscal years  this md a section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
results of operations ruby tuesday restaurants the table below presents the number of ruby tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal through fiscal fiscal year company owned domestic franchise international franchise total during fiscal five company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were opened or acquired  including one purchased from a texas franchisee  company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were closed  aside from one restaurant sold to the company  ten domestic and nine international franchise restaurants were opened and six domestic and seven international were closed  one wok hay was opened in a previously closed ruby tuesday location  we formulated a plan to restructure our property portfolio  which included the closing of restaurants in the third quarter of fiscal and the planned closing of approximately additional restaurants over the next several years  and wrote down properties held for sale to facilitate their disposal resulting in closures and impairments expenses as follows impairments  million  closed restaurant lease reserves  million  dead site write offs  million  gain loss on the sale of surplus properties  million  and other adjustments  million  and we wrote off our goodwill of million as a result of the overall poor economic conditions  declines in fair value  same restaurant sales trends at company owned restaurants  and weak industry conditions 
during fiscal company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were opened or acquired  including purchased from our west palm beach  michigan  and detroit franchisees  company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were closed  and aside from the restaurants sold to the company  nine domestic and five international franchise restaurants were opened and seven two domestic and five international were closed 
restaurant sales restaurant sales in fiscal decreased from fiscal for company owned restaurants and for domestic and international franchised restaurants as explained below 
the tables presented below reflect restaurant sales for the last five years  and other revenue information for the last three years 
restaurant sales in millions fiscal year company owned a franchise a  b a information regarding the restaurant acquired from a franchisee in fiscal and the restaurants acquired from franchisees in fiscal is presented in the ruby tuesday restaurants section of md a shown above

other revenue information company restaurant sales in thousands company restaurant sales growth percentage franchise revenue in thousands a franchise revenue growth percentage total revenue in thousands total revenue growth percentage company same restaurant sales growth percentage company average restaurant volumes million million million company average restaurant volumes growth percentage a franchise revenue includes royalty  license and development fees paid to us by our franchisees  exclusive of support service fees of million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively  which are recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses 
our decrease in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to a decrease in same restaurant sales that contributed to lower overall average restaurant volumes and to a net decrease of ruby tuesday restaurants from the prior year 
the decrease in same restaurant sales is partially attributable to reductions in customer counts in the first three quarters of the year due to a challenging economic environment and various consumer pressures 
our decrease in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to a decrease in same restaurant sales that contributed to lower overall average restaurant volumes  which were partially offset by a net addition of restaurants since the prior year 
the decrease in same restaurant sales is partially attributable to reductions in customer counts  as there were pressures on the consumer such as rising fuel prices  at a time concurrent with that of our move toward the higher end of casual dining 
we also believe that other factors contributing to the decline in same restaurant sales for both fiscal and include the loss of some of our customers who do not feel as comfortable in our re imaged restaurants  the impact of heavy price focused advertising by some of our traditional competitors  and leveling of sales growth in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry resulting from the growth of supply outpacing that of demand 
franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties up to of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue decreased to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal franchise revenue is predominantly comprised of domestic and international royalties  which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decreases in fiscal and are due to temporarily reduced royalty rates for certain franchisees  a decrease in same restaurant sales for domestic franchise ruby tuesday restaurants of and for fiscal and  respectively  and the acquisitions of franchisees in fiscal under our accounting policy  we do not recognize franchise fee revenue for any franchise with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary and the franchise has either borrowed directly from us or through a facility for which we provide a guarantee 
we also do not recognize additional franchise fee revenue from franchisees with fees in excess of days past due 
accordingly  we have deferred recognition of a portion of franchise revenue from certain franchises 
unearned income for franchise fees was million and million as of june  and june   respectively  which are included in other deferred liabilities and or accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
the reduction in unearned income is primarily attributable to fee rebates given to certain franchise partnerships during fiscal for owned franchise partnerships  these rebates created income of million  of which million is included in equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated franchises in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended june  as discussed below 
total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below 
franchise restaurant sales in thousands a franchise restaurant sales growth percentage a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
the decrease in fiscal franchise restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in average restaurant volumes as a result of a decrease in domestic same restaurant sales 
the decrease in fiscal franchise restaurant sales is due to a decrease in average restaurant volumes as a result of a decrease in domestic same restaurant sales coupled with the acquisition of three franchise partnerships  which collectively operated restaurants during fiscal operating profits the following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  for the periods indicated

for fiscal  pre tax profit was million or of total revenue  as compared to million or of total revenue  for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to decreases in same restaurant sales coupled with increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of cost of merchandise  payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  depreciation  selling  general  and administrative expenses  closures and impairment expenses  equity in losses of unconsolidated franchises  and interest expense  net 
cost of merchandise cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal due primarily to value initiatives related to our marketing and our menu 
our marketing initiatives included several promotions offered in the current year including freestanding insert and internet coupons offering a buy one get one free on various menu items 
the menu initiatives included enhancements such as the introduction of lobster and steak menu items and increasing the triple prime burger to eight ounces while offering endless fries with all burgers 
the marketing initiatives had the impact in the current year of reducing average food check which increased the related food cost as a percentage of restaurants sales and operating revenue 
cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to increased food and beverage costs as a result of offering higher quality menu items as part of our strategy to offer compelling value to our guests 
enhancements during the year include increasing the size of steak with the sirloin and jumbo lump crab cake entr e  adding salmon entr es to our menu  and offering promotions featuring ribs and seafood to our guests 
additionally  we utilized direct mail and freestanding insert coupons for various promotions throughout the year  with heaviest usage occurring in the second fiscal quarter 
these promotions had the impact of reducing our average food check and increasing the related food cost as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue 
wine cost also increased as we transitioned to higher grade premium wines 
payroll and related costs payroll and related costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to minimum wage increases in several states during the current year and higher management labor due to loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes 
these increased costs were partially offset by cost savings initiatives implemented in the second half of fiscal including new labor scheduling systems 
payroll and related costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher hourly labor relating to the rollout of the quality service specialist program during the current year  minimum wage increases in several states during the current year  and higher management labor due to loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes 
other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher utility costs  primarily electricity  higher bad debt expense  and higher rent expense due to loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes 
these increases were partially offset by decreases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  of repairs and maintenance costs as a result of lower building repairs due to the completion of a re imaging of our restaurants in fiscal other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher utility costs  primarily electricity  higher repairs due to increased maintenance contracts and equipment replacement costs  higher credit card expense due to recognition of income in the prior year resulting from a settlement with a credit card vendor  higher rent and lease required expenses due to the acquisition of three franchise partnerships during the year  and loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  decreased in fiscal primarily due to accelerated depreciation in the prior year million for restaurants re imaged as part of our re imaging initiative 
depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to accelerated depreciation for restaurants re imaged as part of our re imaging initiative which had begun in the latter part of fiscal and loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes 
income loss from specialty restaurant group  llc bankruptcy specialty restaurant group  llc srg  the company to whom we sold our american cafe and tia s tex mex restaurants concepts in fiscal  closed restaurants on january  as well as several others earlier in fiscal srg declared chapter bankruptcy on february   leading rti to record a pre tax charge of million during fiscal for leases for which we have primary liability 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the srg leases 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased in fiscal the decrease is partially attributable to a reduction in advertising expense as a result of decreases in cable television advertising due to less air time  advertising agency fees  and new menu printing expense 
this reduction was enabled by our shift in marketing strategy to include more coupons  the effect of which is to lower the average check and increase food costs as described above 
additionally  management labor was lower due to the elimination and reduction of certain positions 
share based employee compensation decreased million due to smaller grants in fiscal following a shift in compensation strategy in which management s annual award  formerly issued each april  was transitioned to july to better coincide with the fiscal year to which it relates 
also contributing to the million decrease in share based compensation for fiscal was the expensing in fiscal of million for stock options and restricted shares awarded to a retirement eligible executive 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal the increase is attributable to higher share based compensation expense due to expensing in fiscal of a restricted share grant awarded to a retirement eligible executive 
share based compensation expense increased million in fiscal to million  net of amounts capitalized 
additionally  advertising expense was higher due to utilizing a direct mail program in conjunction with the completion of re imaged restaurants 
support service  marketing and advertising fee income from franchisees  which is recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses  was lower due to the acquisitions of three franchise partnerships during fiscal  temporarily reduced rates for certain franchise partnerships  and reduced requirements for our national advertising fund 
these increased expenses and reduced income amounts were partially offset by lower cable and television expense due to less air time 
closures and impairments closures and impairments  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal the increase is due primarily to charges associated with restaurants we closed during and approximately restaurants we expect to close over the next several years  impairments for discounting surplus properties and the company airplane in order to better market them for immediate sale  and additional dead site write offs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our closures and impairment charges 
closures and impairments  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal due to greater asset impairment charges triggered by our sales declines coupled with lesser gains on sales of surplus properties in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
goodwill impairment we concluded during the second quarter of fiscal that our goodwill was impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge during the fiscal quarter ended december  of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our goodwill impairment 
equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated franchises for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchisees was negligible as compared to equity in losses of million in fiscal the change primarily resulted from decreased losses from investments in each of our six owned franchise partnerships  including three franchise partnerships that experienced losses in the prior year 
the decrease in losses primarily resulted from reduced fees charged to various of the owned franchise partnerships during fiscal as compared to the prior year  along with rebates from rti for million of fees  which had the impact of increasing equity in earnings by million 
the reduced fees  while contributing to improved equity in earnings  had the contrasting impact of lowering our franchise revenue  as previously discussed 
as of june   we held equity investments in each of six franchise partnerships which collectively operate ruby tuesday restaurants 
for fiscal  our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchisees was million as compared to million in fiscal the change primarily resulted from an increase in losses from investments in certain of the franchise partnerships  due in part to same restaurant sales declines 
as of june   we held equity investments in each of six franchise partnerships which collectively operate ruby tuesday restaurants 
net interest expense net interest expense increased million in fiscal due to higher rates on certain of our debt which was restructured in the latter part of fiscal as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section  which was partially offset by lower average debt balances for the fiscal year due to applying our free cash flow to the pay down of debt 
net interest expense increased million in fiscal primarily due to higher debt outstanding resulting from the company acquiring million shares of its stock during the year under our share repurchase program and the timing of repurchases in the prior year 
in addition  the increase is attributable to the acquisition of three franchise entities during the current fiscal year  which resulted in more interest expense due to additional assumed debt  and higher rates in the latter part of the year on certain borrowings 
benefit provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily a result of the company recording a net loss from operations coupled with an increase in tax credits compared to the prior year 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily a result of the impact of tax credits  which remained consistent or increased  while taxable income decreased  and the tax impact of settlements of audits and expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  in part reflecting an overall slowdown in consumer spending  our sales and operating cash flow declined and we renegotiated certain of our loan agreements 
as discussed in more detail below  these revised loan agreements place restrictions on the use of our free cash flow  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  and require us to reduce our outstanding indebtedness with our excess free cash flow 
accordingly  during our cash from operations was principally used to reduce debt 
sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and short term investments operating activities cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was comparable to that of fiscal as many of the charges which contributed to our net loss  such as higher asset impairment expense associated with the closing of restaurants and discounting surplus properties  the goodwill impairment  and an increase in bad debt expense were non cash 
also contributing to the stabilization of our operating cash flow were our net operating assets and liabilities  which collectively produced million more cash flow in fiscal than in the prior year 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal decreased to million due to lower net income and changes in net operating assets  primarily reductions in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  offset by higher depreciation expense 
the reduction in cash associated with changes in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities is attributable to a decrease in accounts payable during fiscal compared to an increase in accounts payable in the prior year due in part to an accrual in the prior year for losses from the srg bankruptcy  and a decrease in insurance reserves in fiscal due to settlement of a dram shop liability case 
the increase in depreciation expense is primarily due to accelerated depreciation million for restaurants re imaged as part of our re imaging initiative which had begun in the latter part of fiscal coupled with additional restaurants attributable to new restaurant openings and franchise acquisitions 
our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of june  were million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset or debt reduction a long term liability and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
investing activities we require capital principally for the maintenance and upkeep of our existing restaurants  limited new restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment  remodeling of existing restaurants  and on occasion for the acquisition of franchisees or other restaurant concepts 
property and equipment expenditures purchased primarily with internally generated cash flows for fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  proceeds from the disposal of assets produced million of cash in fiscal following an action taken to aggressively market surplus properties in order to pay down debt 
amounts reflected for fiscal included million for a company wide re image project 
also during fiscal  we spent million  plus assumed debt  to acquire  directly and through our subsidiaries  the remaining member or limited partnership interests of three franchise partnerships and certain assets from wok hay  llc 
these acquisitions added restaurants to the company 
further acquisitions  particularly from franchisees in the eastern united states  may occur either during fiscal or thereafter 
capital expenditures for fiscal are budgeted to be to million based on our planned improvements for existing restaurants and our expectation that we will not open any company owned ruby tuesday restaurants in fiscal we intend to fund capital expenditures for company owned restaurants with cash provided by operations 
financing activities historically our primary sources of cash have been operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises and refranchising transactions 
when these alone have not provided sufficient funds for both our capital and other needs  we have obtained funds through the issuance of indebtedness 
our current borrowings and credit facilities are summarized below 
on november   we entered into a five year revolving credit agreement the credit facility to provide capital for general corporate purposes 
on february   we amended and restated our credit facility such that the aggregate amount we may borrow increased to million 
this amount included a million subcommitment for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a million subcommitment for swingline loans 
due to concerns that at some point in the future we might not be in compliance with certain of our debt covenants  we entered into an additional amendment of the amended and restated credit facility on may  the may  amendment to the credit facility  as well as a similarly dated amendment and restatement of the notes issued in the private placement as discussed below  eased financial covenants regarding minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum funded debt ratio 
we are currently in compliance with our debt covenants 
in exchange for the new covenant requirements  in addition to higher interest rate spreads and mandatory reductions in capacity and or prepayments of principal  the amendments also imposed restrictions on future capital expenditures and require us to achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters before we may pay dividends or repurchase any of our stock 
following the may  amendment to the credit facility  through a series of scheduled quarterly and other required reductions  our original million capacity has been reduced  as of june   to million 
we expect the capacity of the credit facility to be further reduced by million in fiscal under the credit facility  interest rates charged on borrowings can vary depending on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or an adjusted libo rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin is zero to for the base rate loans and a percentage ranging from to for the libo rate based option 
we pay commitment fees quarterly ranging from to on the unused portion of the credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  we had borrowings of million with an associated floating rate of interest of at june  as of june   we had million outstanding with an associated floating rate of interest of 
after consideration of letters of credit outstanding  we had million available under the credit facility as of june  the credit facility will mature on february  on april   we issued notes totaling million through a private placement of debt the private placement 
on may   given similar circumstances as those with the credit facility discussed above  we amended and restated the notes issued in the private placement 
the may  amendment requires us to offer quarterly and other prepayments  which predominantly consist of semi annual prepayments to be determined based upon excess cash flows as defined in the private placement 
at june   the private placement consisted of million in notes with an interest rate of the series a notes and million in notes with an interest rate of the series b notes 
the series a notes and series b notes mature on april  and april   respectively 
during fiscal  we offered  and our noteholders accepted  principal prepayments of million and million on the series a and b notes  respectively 
we estimate that we will offer prepayments totaling million during the next twelve months 
accordingly  we have classified million as current as of june  this amount includes four quarterly offers of million each and additional amounts to be determined based upon excess cash flows 
we currently project that million will be outstanding on april   the maturity date of our series a notes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 classification of short term obligations expected to be refinanced  because of our ability and intent to refinance the balance on a long term basis by utilizing the available capacity on our credit facility  we have classified this amount as non current in our june  consolidated balance sheet 
simultaneous with the other may  amendments  we entered into a pledge agreement with our credit facility and private placement creditors  as well as those creditors associated with our franchise facility discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  whereby we pledged certain subsidiary equity interests as security for the repayment of our obligations under these agreements 
there were no share repurchases or dividends paid during fiscal for fiscal and  cash used for share repurchases totaled million and million  respectively 
cash used for dividend payments during those same periods totaled million and million  respectively 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on july   we closed an underwritten public offering of million shares of ruby tuesday  inc common stock at per share  less underwriting discounts 
the amount sold included million shares sold in connection with the exercise of an over allotment option granted to the underwriters 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of the shares  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses 
wells fargo securities and bofa merrill lynch acted as joint book running managers for the offering and suntrust robinson humphrey and morgan keegan company  inc were co managers of the offering 
the net proceeds were used to repay indebtedness under our credit facility 
covenant compliance under the terms of the credit facility and the notes issued in the private placement  we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests and covenants 
the financial ratios include maximum funded debt  minimum fixed charge coverage and minimum net worth covenants 
our continued ability to meet those financial ratios  tests and covenants can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios  tests and covenants 
our maximum funded debt covenant is an adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitdar ratio 
adjusted total debt  as defined in our covenants  includes items both on balance sheet debt and capital lease obligations and off balance sheet such as the present value of operating leases  letters of credit and guarantees 
consolidated ebitdar is consolidated net income for the company and its majority owned subsidiaries plus interest charges  income tax  depreciation  amortization  rent and other non cash charges 
among other charges  we have reflected share based compensation  asset impairment and bad debt expense  as non cash 
until the end of the quarter ended march   we could add back the costs up to million incurred in connection with the closing of restaurants recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our fixed charge coverage ratio compares consolidated ebitdar as discussed above to interest and cash based rents 
consolidated ebitdar and adjusted total debt are not presentations made in accordance with gaap  and  as such  should not be considered a measure of financial performance or condition  liquidity or profitability 
they also should not be considered alternatives to gaap based net income or balance sheet amounts or operating cash flows or indicators of the amount of free cash flow available for discretionary use by management  as consolidated ebitdar does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments or debt service requirements and adjusted total debt includes certain off balance sheet items 
further  because not all companies use identical calculations  amounts reflected by rti as consolidated ebitdar or adjusted total debt may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
we believe that the information shown below is relevant as it presents the amounts used to calculate covenants which are provided to our lenders 
non compliance with our debt covenants could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under such agreements 
the following is a reconciliation of net income  which is a gaap based measure of our operating results  to consolidated ebitdar as defined in our bank covenants in thousands fiscal year ended june  net loss interest expense benefit for income taxes depreciation amortization of intangibles rent expense share based compensation expense goodwill impairment asset impairments equity in earnings of subsidiaries bad debt expense dead site write offs amortization of debt issuance costs non cash accruals restaurant closing costs other consolidated ebitdar our covenant requirements and actual ratios for the fiscal quarter ended june  are as follows covenant actual requirements ratios maximum funded debt ratio x x minimum fixed charge coverage ratio x x the credit facility and notes issued in the private placement require us to maintain a maximum funded debt ratio  defined as adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitdar  of x from december  to september  the end of the first quarter of fiscal  x from september  to march  the end of the third quarter of fiscal  x from march  to march  the end of the third quarter of fiscal  x from march  to march  the end of the third quarter of fiscal  and  for the notes issued in the private placement only  x thereafter 
we expect to generate free cash flow of to million during fiscal  a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to the reduction of debt 
the credit facility and notes issued in the private placement require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of x through march   x from march  to march   and  for the notes issued in conjunction with the private placement  x thereafter 
our minimum consolidated net worth covenant requires us to maintain a net worth  primarily comprised of the par value of our common stock  plus additional paid in capital and retained earnings  of  plus of our consolidated net income for each completed fiscal year ending after june  years with net losses are to be excluded from the calculation 
for purposes of this requirement  we are allowed to exclude from retained earnings charges recorded for the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million and million relating to impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
we reported net income of million for the period of fiscal and a net loss for fiscal under our covenants  this level of net income results in a consolidated net worth requirement  as defined  of million 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment million  net of tax and other intangible asset impairments million  net of tax  the sum of the par value of our common stock  additional paid in capital and retained earnings as of june  was million

share repurchases from time to time our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock as a means to return excess capital to our shareholders 
the timing  price  quantity and manner of the purchases have been made at the discretion of management  depending upon market conditions and the restrictions contained in our loan agreements 
although million shares remained available for purchase under existing programs at june   our loan agreements  as amended in fiscal  prohibit the repurchase of our common stock until we achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
these thresholds were not achieved during fiscal and thus we did not repurchase any shares of rti common stock 
were we to achieve these leverage thresholds  the repurchase of shares in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future

employment agreement we have an employment agreement with samuel e 
beall  iii  whereby he has agreed to serve as chief executive officer of the company until july  in accordance with the agreement  mr 
beall is compensated at a base salary adjusted annually based on various company or market factors and is entitled to an annual bonus opportunity and a long term incentive compensation program  which currently includes stock option and restricted stock grants and life insurance coverage 
the employment agreement also provides for certain severance payments to be made in the event of an involuntary termination without cause and certain types of voluntary resignation  the circumstances of which are defined in the agreement 
as of june   the total of the potential liability for severance payments with regard to the employment agreement was approximately million 
critical accounting policies our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based employee compensation share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock awards based on the closing price of our common stock on the date prior to approval of the award by our board of directors 
we determine the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value 
in the instance of a potential sale of a restaurant in a refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least one quarter shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
at june   we had restaurants that had been open more than one year with rolling month negative cash flows of which have been impaired to salvage value 
of the which remained  we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at each of the restaurants and determined that no impairment was necessary 
the remaining net book value of these restaurants was million at june  should sales at these restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time  further impairment charges are possible 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  salvage value  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
franchise accounting equity method accounting as of june   we were the franchisor of franchise partnership ruby tuesday restaurants and traditional domestic and international franchised restaurants 
based on an analysis prepared using financial information obtained  when necessary  from the franchise entities  we concluded that  for all periods presented  we were not required to consolidate any of the franchise entities under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
although we do have loans to and provide guarantees for certain of our franchise partnerships  they each have substantial other business activities 
we have not consolidated these entities  as we believe that each of these entities meets the definition of a business and we do not provide more than half of the total of the equity  subordinated debt  and other forms of subordinated financial support to these entities based on an analysis of the fair values of our interests in these entities 
we apply the equity method of accounting to our six owned franchise partnerships 
accordingly  we recognize our pro rata share of the earnings or losses of the franchise partnerships in the consolidated statements of operations when reported by those franchisees 
the cost method of accounting is applied to all owned franchise partnerships 
revenue recognition we charge our franchise partnerships various monthly fees that are calculated as a percentage of the respective franchise s monthly sales 
our franchise agreements allow us to charge up to a royalty fee  a support service fee  a marketing and purchasing fee  and an advertising fee of up to 
we defer recognition of franchise fee revenue for any franchise partnership with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary and the franchise has either borrowed directly from us or through a facility for which we provide a guarantee 
we also do not recognize franchise fee revenue from franchises with fees in excess of days past due 
unearned income for franchise fees was million and million as of june  and june   respectively  which are included in other deferred liabilities and or accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
allowance for doubtful notes and interest income we follow a systematic methodology each quarter in our analysis of franchise and other notes receivable in order to estimate losses inherent at the balance sheet date 
a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio involves reviewing the following for each significant borrower terms including interest rate  original note date  payoff date  and principal and interest start dates  note amounts including the original balance  current balance  associated debt guarantees  and total exposure  and other relevant information including whether the borrower is making timely interest  principal  royalty and support payments  the borrower s debt coverage ratios  the borrower s current financial condition and sales trends  the borrower s additional borrowing capacity  and  as appropriate  management s judgment on the quality of the borrower s operations 
based on the results of this analysis  the allowance for doubtful notes is adjusted as appropriate 
no portion of the allowance for doubtful notes is allocated to guarantees 
in the event that collection is deemed to be an issue  a number of actions to resolve the issue are possible  including modification to the terms of payment of franchise fees or note obligations or a restructuring of the borrower s debt to better position the borrower to fulfill its obligations 
the allowance for doubtful notes represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the notes receivable at the balance sheet date 
during fiscal   and  we increased decreased the reserve million  million  and million  respectively  based on our estimate of the extent of those losses 
we recognize interest income on notes receivable when earned which sometimes precedes collection 
a number of our franchise notes have  since the inception of these notes  allowed for the deferral of interest during the first one to three years 
all franchisees that issued outstanding notes to us are currently paying interest on these notes 
it is our policy to cease accruing interest income and recognize interest on a cash basis when we determine that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the same analysis noted above for doubtful notes is utilized in determining whether to cease recognizing interest income and thereafter record interest payments on the cash basis 
lease obligations we lease a significant number of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the premises  and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments  called contingent rents  when the associated restaurants sales volumes exceed agreed upon levels 
we recognize contingent rental expense in annual as well as interim periods prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense  provided that achievement of that target is considered probable 
estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on third party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items 
as of june   we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future tax deductions attributable to our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we record appropriate accruals for potential exposures should a taxing authority take a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these accruals  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate tax liability

known events  uncertainties and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  letters of credit  and any guarantees  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility and attaining the equivalent of an investment grade bond rating 
this strategy has periodically allowed us to repurchase rti common stock 
during the year ended june   we did not repurchase any shares of rti common stock 
the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased  as of june   is approximately million 
this amount reflects repurchase authorizations of million and million shares approved by our board of directors on january  and july   respectively 
to the extent not funded with cash from operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises  additional repurchases  if any  may be funded by borrowings 
however  as previously discussed  under the terms of the amendment to the credit facility and the amendment and restatement of the private placement  we may not engage in the repurchase of our stock until we achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
were we to achieve these leverage thresholds  the repurchase of shares in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain  however  at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to our shareholders 
as noted above  following the amendment to the credit facility and the amendment and restatement of the notes issued in the private placement we may not pay a dividend until we achieve certain leverage thresholds for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
were we to achieve these leverage thresholds  the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain  however  at the discretion of the board of directors and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
franchising and development agreements our agreements with franchise partnerships allow us to purchase an additional equity interest for a specified price 
we have chosen to exercise that option in situations in which we expect to earn a return similar to or better than that which we expect when we invest in new restaurants 
during fiscal and  we did not exercise our right to acquire an additional equity interest in any franchise partnerships 
we currently have a ownership in seven of our franchise partnerships which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants at june  our franchise agreements with the franchise partnerships allow us to purchase all remaining equity interests beyond the or we already own  for an amount to be calculated based upon a predetermined valuation formula 
we did not exercise our right to acquire the remaining equity interests of any of our franchise partnerships during fiscal during fiscal  we acquired the remaining partnership interests of rt west palm beach franchise  lp  rt michigan franchise  llc  and rt detroit franchise  llc  bringing our equity interest in these franchises to 
at the time of the acquisitions  the franchisees operated   and ruby tuesday restaurants  respectively 
to the extent allowable under our debt facilities  we may choose to sell existing restaurants or exercise our rights to acquire an additional equity interest in franchise partnerships in fiscal and beyond 
fiscal year rti s fiscal will contain weeks and end on june  impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  utilities  real estate and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover certain inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our credit facility can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or libo rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin is zero to for the base rate loans and a percentage ranging from to for the libo rate based option 
as of june   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of million per year  assuming a consistent capital structure 
many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
