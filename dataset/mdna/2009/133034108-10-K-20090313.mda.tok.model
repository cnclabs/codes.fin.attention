item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis  which follows  focuses on the factors affecting our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and and financial condition at december  and  and where appropriate  factors that may affect future financial performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data 
executive overview net income for of million was less than the net income of million reported in net income per diluted share was  a decrease from the reported for the following were significant factors related to the results of fiscal year compared to fiscal year we completed the acquisition of union bankshares company effective january   thus the financial results from that date reflect the combined entity 
net interest income for increased to million due to the acquisition of union bankshares company and an improvement in the net interest margin 
the provision for loan losses of million increased million in over as a result of an increase in net charge offs and non performing assets 
net charge offs to average loans were for compared to for and non performing assets as a percentage of total assets amounted to and at december  and  respectively 
non interest income before investment securities losses for was million  a increase over the increase was driven by increases in service charges on deposit accounts  income from fiduciary services at at  and brokerage commission income at afc resulting primarily from the customer relationships gained in the acquisition of union trust 
we recorded net losses on our investment securities portfolio totaling million in primarily due to the million write down of securities collateralized by freddie mac preferred stock 
non interest expense for was million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year  which was primarily due to the expansion of our banking franchise with the union trust acquisition 
total loans at december  were billion  an increase of million compared to december  excluding the million of loans acquired from union trust  our loan balance declined million primarily in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios  in part offset by an increase in the consumer loan portfolio reflecting continued demand for home equity loans 
investment securities increased million in  which includes million from the union trust acquisition  and net purchases during the year of million 
total liabilities at december  of billion increased million  or  as deposits increased million primarily reflecting the assumption of million of deposits from the union trust acquisition  with the remaining net deposit growth primarily in retail certificate of deposit accounts 
borrowings increased million  primarily in federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  due to the assumption of borrowings from union trust 
shareholders equity increased due to the issuance of million of common stock related to the union trust acquisition and current year earnings  in part offset by other comprehensive loss  share buybacks and dividends declared 

table of contents critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from our current estimates  as a result of changing conditions and future events 
several estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change  including the all  accounting for acquisitions and review of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment  valuation of other real estate owned  other than temporary impairment of investments  accounting for postretirement plans and income taxes 
our significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in note of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the all requires the most significant amount of management estimates and assumptions 
the all  which is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses  is based on our evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
we regularly evaluate the all for adequacy by taking into consideration  among other factors  local industry trends  management s ongoing review of individual loans  trends in levels of watched or criticized assets  an evaluation of results of examinations by regulatory authorities and other third parties  analyses of historical trends in charge offs and delinquencies  the character and size of the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions and our estimation of probable losses 
in determining the appropriate level of all  we use a methodology to systematically measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio 
the methodology includes four elements identification of loss allocations for certain specific loans  loss allocation factors for certain loan types based on credit grade and loss experience  general loss allocations for other environmental factors  and unallocated allowance 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful  substandard or special mention 
for such loans that are also classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the methodology is in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  specifically  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and we use a risk rating system to determine the credit quality of our loans and apply the related loss allocation factors 
in assessing the risk rating of a particular loan  we consider  among other factors  the obligor s debt capacity  financial condition and flexibility  the level of the obligor s earnings  the amount and sources of repayment  the performance with respect to loan terms  the adequacy of collateral  the level and nature of contingencies  management strength  and the industry in which the obligor operates 
these factors are based on an evaluation of historical information  as well as subjective assessment and interpretation of current conditions 
emphasizing one factor over another  or considering additional factors that may be relevant in determining the risk rating of a particular loan but which are not currently an explicit part of our methodology  could impact the risk rating assigned to that loan 
we periodically reassess and revise the loss allocation factors used in the assignment of loss exposure to appropriately reflect our analysis of loss experience 
portfolios of more homogenous populations of loans including residential mortgages and consumer loans are analyzed as groups taking into account delinquency rates and other economic conditions which may affect the ability of borrowers to meet debt service requirements  including interest rates and energy costs 
we also consider the results of regulatory examinations  historical loss ranges  portfolio composition  and other changes in the portfolio 
an additional allocation is determined based on a judgmental process whereby management considers qualitative and quantitative assessments of other environmental factors 
for example  a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated among borrowers in southern maine and a substantial portion of the portfolio is collateralized by real estate in this area 
another portion of the commercial and commercial real estate loans are to borrowers in the hospitality  tourism and recreation industries 
finally  an unallocated portion of the total allowance is maintained to allow for shifts in portfolio composition 
since the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends as well as management s judgment  factors may arise that result in different estimations 
significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates may include  but are not limited to  changes in economic conditions in our market area  concentration of risk  declines in local property values  and results of regulatory examinations 
while management s 
table of contents evaluation of the all as of december  determined the allowance to be appropriate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  we may need to increase the allowance 
the corporate risk management group reviews the all with the cnb board of directors on a monthly basis 
a more in depth review of the all  including the methodology for calculating and allocating the all  is reviewed with the company s board of directors  as well as the cnb board of directors  on a quarterly basis 
accounting for acquisitions and review of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment 
we are required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which is an estimate determined by the use of internal or other valuation techniques 
these valuation estimates result in goodwill and other intangible assets and are subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests and are evaluated using various fair value techniques 
impairment evaluations are required to be performed annually and may be required more frequently if certain conditions indicating potential impairment exist 
if we were to determine that our goodwill was impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on our financial position 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using several standard valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses  as well as an estimation of the impact of business conditions 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different estimates of carrying value 
valuation of other real estate owned oreo 
periodically  we acquire property in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of debt previously contracted 
the valuation of this property is accounted for individually at the lower of the book value of the loan satisfied or its net realizable value on the date of acquisition 
at the acquisition date  if the net realizable value of the property is less than the book value of the loan  a charge or reduction in the all is recorded 
if the value of the property becomes permanently impaired  as determined by an appraisal or an evaluation in accordance with our appraisal policy  we will record the decline by charging against current earnings 
upon acquisition of a property  a current appraisal or broker s opinion must substantiate market value for the property 
other than temporary impairment of investments 
we record an investment impairment charge at the point we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred  we review information about the underlying investment that is publicly available  analysts reports  applicable industry data and other pertinent information  and assess our ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future 
the investment is written down to its current market value at the time the impairment is deemed to have occurred 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional impairment charge in the future 
accounting for postretirement plans 
we use a december measurement date to determine the expenses for our postretirement plans and related financial disclosure information 
postretirement plan expense is sensitive to changes in eligible employees and their related demographics and to changes in the discount rate and other expected rates  such as medical cost trends rates 
as with the computations on plan expense  cash contribution requirements are also sensitive to such changes 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes by deferring income taxes based on estimated future tax effects of differences between the tax and book basis of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated statement of condition 
we must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and establish a valuation allowance for those assets determined not likely to be recoverable 
judgment is required in determining the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities  including projections of future taxable income 
although we have determined a valuation allowance is not required for all deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that these assets will be recognizable 
although not currently under review  income tax returns for the years ended december  through are open to audit by federal and maine authorities 
if we  as a result of an audit  were assessed interest and penalties  the amounts would be recorded through other non interest expense 

table of contents results of operations core results in  certain non core items are included in the computation of earnings in accordance with gaap as described in the table below 
in an effort to provide investors information regarding our core results  we have disclosed in the table below certain non gaap information which we believe provides useful information to the investor 
this information should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap  nor is it necessarily comparable to non gaap information which may be presented by other companies

net interest income reflects revenues generated through income from earning assets plus loan fees  less interest paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  by loan and deposit pricing strategies and competitive conditions  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
net interest income was million on a fully taxable equivalent basis in  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in net interest income is largely due to the acquisition of union bankshares company and an improvement in the net interest margin of basis points to for average interest earning assets increased by million  or  in  primarily due to loans and investment securities acquired with union trust 
the yield on total loans decreased basis points in  reflecting a decline in the interest rate environment whereas the yield on taxable securities increased basis points in as investment purchases were added to the portfolio at slightly higher yields than maturing investments 
in  average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or  while cost of funds decreased basis points 
the increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to deposits and borrowings acquired with union trust combined with growth in certificates of deposit 
as short term interest rates declined  we were successful in reducing retail deposit interest rates resulting in a basis point decline in the cost of funds 
future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand  growth in deposits and the general level of interest rates

net charge offs to average loans was for compared to for with charge off activity centered in commercial and commercial real estate loans 
see additional all discussion under the caption asset quality 
non interest income non interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   from million in  which was a decline of million 
the decline resulted from the million of net investment securities losses  in part offset by increases in service charges on deposit accounts  other service charges and fees  income from fiduciary services at at  and brokerage commission income at afc  all due primarily to customer relationships gained in the acquisition of union trust 
the significant changes in compared to include increase in service charges on deposit accounts of million due to increases in net overdraft fees  increase in other service charges and fees of  due to increased debit card program income and atm fee income  both resulting from increased transaction volumes  
table of contents increase in income from fiduciary services of million  or  due to the acquisition related increase in assets under administration at at  partially offset by market value declines caused by the drop in stock markets  increase in brokerage and insurance commission income of  or  due to the acquisition related increase in assets under management and an increase in annuity sales at afc  and increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance of  primarily due to an increase in the amount of bank owned policies resulting from the union trust acquisition and the purchase of additional policies 
incurred million of net investment securities losses  of which million was due to the write down of other than temporarily impaired securities resulting from investments in auction pass through certificates with an amortized cost of million issued by trusts sponsored by merrill lynch co  the assets of which consisted of freddie mac preferred stock 
on september   the us treasury department placed freddie mac in conservatorship and  as a result of this action  the payment of dividends ceased on all freddie mac issued stock  including the preferred stock supporting the auction pass through certificates 
through december   the freddie mac preferred stock collateralizing the securities had severely declined in value  and as a result  we recorded full impairment of the investment 
the remaining  of net investment securities losses was the result of a first quarter gain of  resulting from the restructuring of certain investment securities acquired from union trust  net of third quarter losses of  related to the sales of certain preferred stock holdings 
non interest expenses total non interest expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the significant changes in compared to include increase in salary and employee benefit costs of million  or  primarily due to the union trust acquisition  including the retention of additional staff to facilitate the integration  increase in net occupancy and fixed asset costs of million  or  and million  or  respectively  primarily due to the addition of branches resulting from the union trust acquisition  increase in other non interest expenses of million  or  for compared to  primarily due to integration costs associated with the union trust acquisition and other incremental cost increases resulting from the union trust acquisition  such as courier costs  debit card program costs  postage  and donations 
in addition  we experienced an increase of  in foreclosure and collection costs and expenses on other real estate owned related to the increase in non performing assets  and improvement in the efficiency ratio non interest expense divided by net interest income plus non interest income excluding net investment securities losses to for the year ended december   compared to for in  under the increased fdic assessment rates  our contribution to the dif is expected to increase to approximately million from  in in addition to the general increase in the assessment rate  the fdic is expected to impose a special basis point assessment for the third quarter of  which as presented  would increase our contribution approximately million 
comparison of to net income for of million was nearly equivalent to the net income of million reported in net income per diluted share was  a increase over the reported for  which reflects the favorable impact of the common stock repurchases completed in and early return on average assets was in  compared to in and return on average shareholders equity was in  compared to in 
table of contents net interest income net interest income decreased  or million  which was primarily a function of the flat yield curve  which drove up deposit and borrowing costs more significantly than income on earning assets  and the addition of a full year of interest cost on the trust preferred securities issued during as a result  the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was in  compared to in net interest income was million on a fully taxable equivalent basis in  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
impact of rates 
overall  during compared to  our net interest income was adversely impacted million due to rate changes  with increased earning asset yields contributing million  while increased funding costs decreased net interest income million 
during the first three quarters of  benchmark interest rates were at levels above those in and remained relatively stable until declines in the fourth quarter of a one half percentage point  followed by two quarter percentage point decreases  in the fed funds rate  which culminated at at december  the slope of the curve was relatively flat  thus the spread between short term and long term rates was historically low 
interest income on securities was positively impacted  during as a result of new investments being added to the portfolio at higher yields than maturing investments 
our loan yields were also positively impacted  due to increases in market rates  in addition to the mid year credit and subprime crisis  which has resulted in the gradual return of pricing credit risk into loan rates 
for our interest bearing liabilities  the higher rate environment and flat yield curve during had a negative impact as maturing deposit products and term borrowings re priced upward upon maturity 
as a result of the rate environment and the highly competitive environment in which we compete  we raised the rates paid on certain deposit products  primarily certificates of deposit and money market accounts  as competitors also raised rates paid on such products 
due to the increase in rates paid on deposit products  our interest expense increased million in compared to in addition  in  we were negatively impacted  due to increases in short term borrowing rates  which were primarily overnight funds from the fhlb and  due to increased rates paid on our brokered certificate of deposits 
impact of volume 
overall  during compared to  our net interest income was negatively impacted million due to volume changes  with average earning asset growth and mix reducing the margin million  and the need for increased funding to support the average asset growth decreased net interest income million 
during  average investment volume increases contributed million to net interest income  while average loan balance declines reduced the margin million 
in order to fund the modest average balance sheet growth experienced during  average retail deposits increased million  or  and borrowings increased million  or  partially offset by a million  or  decline in average brokered deposits 
during  the all in cost of brokered certificates of deposit was greater than the borrowing cost for wholesale repurchase agreements or fhlb advances with similar maturities  thus resulting in the decline in brokered certificate of deposit balances 
provision for loan losses during  we provided  of expense to the provision for loan losses compared to million for the decrease to the all for was primarily due to the contraction of the loan portfolio  which decreased million  or  from december  to december  in  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans decreased to from in in addition  net charge offs were  less in compared to the all as a percentage of total loans was at december   a decrease from at december  non interest income non interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  which was growth of million  or
