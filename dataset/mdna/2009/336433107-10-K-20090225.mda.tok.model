table of contents overview we design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world 
each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity 
we manufacture our solar modules on high throughput production lines and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated  proprietary  continuous process 
during  and  we sold most of our solar modules to solar power system developers  system integrators and operators headquartered in germany  france and spain 
currently  we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg  ohio  frankfurt oder  germany and kulim  malaysia manufacturing facilities and conduct our research and development activities at our perrysburg  ohio manufacturing facility 
our average manufacturing cost per watt has decreased from during to during we define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during a period divided by the total watts produced during that period 
by continuing to expand production globally and improve our technology and manufacturing process  we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt 
we were founded in to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research  development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in january on february   we were incorporated as a delaware corporation 
prior to that date  we operated as a delaware limited liability company 
on november   we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy  llc  a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities and fortune companies in the united states 
we have integrated the operations from this acquisition into our solar power systems and project development business 
this business sells solar power systems directly to system owners 
these systems include both our solar modules and balance of system components that we procure from third parties 
we also sell integrated services related to the development of commercial solar projects in the united states  such as the system design  engineering  procurement of permits and balance of system components  construction management  monitoring and maintenance as part of a system solution delivery 
this acquisition has created a platform for our systems business in north america to deliver solar electricity solutions to utility companies 
the total consideration for the transaction was million excluding exit and transaction costs of million  consisting of million in common stock and million in cash see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday on or before december all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december   all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december   and all references to fiscal year relate to the weeks ended december  we use a week fiscal quarter 
manufacturing capacity as of december  we operated production lines at our plants in perrysburg  ohio  frankfurt oder  germany and kulim  malaysia 
after completion of plant four at our malaysian manufacturing center and the expansion of our perrysburg  ohio plant we will have production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately mw based on the fourth quarter of run rate at our existing plants 
financial operations overview the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 

table of contents net sales we generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules 
we price and sell our solar modules per watt of power 
as a result  our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts or price 
we currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar power system project developers  system integrators and operators headquartered in germany  france and spain  which either resell our solar modules to end users or integrate them into power plants that they own or operate or sell 
the solar industry has been moving from a supply driven to a demand driven industry  with increasing competitive pressure as the supply of solar modules exceeds current demand 
our customers face significant challenges under the current economic conditions  including an increase in interest or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital to finance solar projects 
our net sales could be adversely impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in europe  north america or asia or if interest rates increase or financing is no longer available  which could impact our end users ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects 
in addition  subsidies for our customers  particularly in germany  are declining at a rate that is greater than the annual contractual price decline we extend under our long term supply contracts 
as result  we may be less competitive and not meet our customers internal rate of return irr or the profit margin of our customers might decline  which could lower demand for our solar panels 
our sales prices under the long term supply contracts are denominated in euro  exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
approximately of our sales are denominated in euro and subject to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 
for example  the strengthening of the euro during increased our net sales by in fiscal compared to fiscal in april  we entered into long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six european solar power system project developers and system integrators  and in  we entered into additional long term contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six other european project developers that also own and operate renewable energy projects 
in  we entered into long term contracts with three european project developers  system integrators and operators and increased our contracted volume with four customers 
we also entered into a five year agreement with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the united states  which is a related party 
these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from through  and therefore  will significantly affect our overall financial performance 
our long term supply contracts entered into in require us to deliver solar modules each year that  in total  meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year 
under these long term supply contracts  we are required to increase the minimum average number of watts per module by approximately annually from to and then by for modules delivered in if we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year  we will be in breach of the applicable agreements  entitling our customers to certain remedies  potentially including the right to terminate their long term supply contracts 
our long term supply contracts entered into in do not require a minimum average number of watts per module but provide for a base number of watts per module that increases annually from to  and then remains fixed through  and contain a price adjustment per watt if the watts delivered per module are higher or lower than the base number of watts per module 
as of december   all of our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of the contracts in because the sales prices under our long term supply contracts are fixed and have the built in decline each year  we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers 
although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the long term supply contracts  our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross profit 
our long term supply contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately billion billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of and billion denominated in usd in sales from to during  we amended a long term supply contract with one customer  which reduced the volume of solar modules delivered to such customer in and also reduced the volume of solar modules to be delivered over the remaining term of the agreement to such customer 
during february we amended our long term supply contracts with two customers to accelerate the decline in the sales price per watt under such contracts in and 
table of contents in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under such contracts 
we are currently in discussions with several other customers about making similar amendments to their long term supply contracts 
the annual decline in the sales price under our long term supply contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately each year  assuming that the rated power of our solar modules remains flat  and will impact our cash flow accordingly 
as a result  our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease 
under our customer contracts  starting in april  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment 
under our customer contracts in effect prior to april   we did not transfer title or risk of loss  or recognize revenue  until the solar modules were received by our customers 
our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 
we have the right to terminate certain long term supply contracts upon months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred  including  depending on the contract one or more of the following new laws  rules or regulations with respect to our production  distribution  installation or collection and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business  unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread  persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels  or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor  materials or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput 
the average termination fee under those agreements is million ranging from million to million 
our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume 
these delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the long term supply contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers 
in the case of a late delivery  certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue 
if we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments  our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis 
with our acquisition of turner renewable energy  llc on november   we began accounting for a portion of our revenues using the percent of completion method of accounting 
revenues for our solar power systems and project development business for the years ended december  and december  were million and million  respectively  and were not material to our consolidated results of operations 
during  our principal customers were blitzstrom gmbh  colexon energy ag previously reinecke pohl  conergy ag  juwi solar gmbh and phoenix solar ag 
during  each of these five customers individually accounted for between and of our net sales 
all of our other customers individually accounted for less than of our net sales during cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components  such as tempered back glass  transparent conductive oxide tco coated front glass  cadmium telluride  laminate  connector assemblies  laminate edge seal and others 
other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense  equipment maintenance  environmental health and safety expenses  quality and production control and procurement 
cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plants and equipment and facility related expenses 
in addition  we accrue warranty and solar module end of life collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales 
we implemented a program in to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use 
under our collection and recycling program  we enter into an agreement with the end users of the solar power systems that use our solar modules 
in the agreement  we commit  at our expense  to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used panels or recycled to recover some of the raw materials 
in return  the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our end of life collection and recycling 
table of contents program or another program that we approve of  and the solar power system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide 
at the time we sell a solar module  we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future end of life collection and recycling obligation 
we subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation  which we classify with selling  general and administrative expense 
overall  we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module  an increase in unit output per line  geographic diversification into lower cost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 
deferred project costs represent uninstalled materials we have procured for customer projects 
we recognize these costs as deferred assets until we install the materials 
deferred project costs were million at december  gross profit gross profit is affected by numerous factors  including our average selling prices  foreign exchange rates  our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities 
for example  our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines at the beginning of each year 
another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached 
as a result  gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research and development research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of products  materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities 
we continually add equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense 
we may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the ohio expansion to research and development expense 
we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and of our manufacturing processes 
we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the united states department of energy  brookhaven national laboratory and several universities 
we report our research and development expense net of grant funding 
during the past four years  we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs 
we received million  million and million during the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity 
over time  we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  travel expense and other selling expenses 
we expect these expenses to increase in the near term  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts  improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting  compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company 
over time  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase 
production start up production start up expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production  including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase 
it also includes all expenses related to the 
table of contents selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program  to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 
production start up expenses during were million due to the qualification of our ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of our german plant 
we incurred production start up expense of million during in connection with the qualification of the german plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our malaysian manufacturing center 
production start up expense during was million relating to the planning and preparation of our plants at the malaysian manufacturing center 
in general  we expect production start up expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility  primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 
we also expect to incur production start up expenses during related to our expansion of our perrysburg  ohio manufacturing facility and plant four at the malaysian manufacturing center 
over time  we expect production start up expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 
interest income interest income is earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  is incurred on various debt financings 
foreign currency gain loss foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto 
some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results 
we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience  on our forecasts and on other available information  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are further described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our critical accounting policies and estimates  which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are as follows revenue recognition 
we sell our products directly to solar power system integrators and operators and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
this policy is in accordance with the requirements of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revision of topic revenue recognition 
under this policy  we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the sales contract 
we do not offer extended payment terms or rights of return for our sold products 
with our acquisition of turner renewable energy  llc on november   a portion of our revenues will be derived from long term contracts that we account for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
sop  accounting for performance of construction type and 
table of contents certain production type contracts 
accordingly  we recognize revenue on long term fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
if we identify any losses on contracts  we will recognize those losses immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment in assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
furthermore  contract change orders  claims and similar items  require us to use judgment in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
we only include contract change orders  claims and similar items in contract value when we can reliably estimate their amounts and can conclude that their realization is probable 
incurred costs include all direct material  labor  subcontractor cost  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies and tools 
we recognize job material costs as incurred costs when the job materials have been installed 
when contracts specify that title to job materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed  we defer revenue and recognize it upon installation  using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we consider job materials to be installed materials when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by the engineering design 
our liability for billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  which is part of the balance sheet caption other current liabilities  was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
this liability represents our billings in excess of revenues recognized on our contracts  which results from differences between contractual billing schedules and the timing of revenue recognition under our revenue recognition accounting policies 
we also have a limited number of revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables 
these are contracts under which we provide design and consulting services for and we supply parts and equipment for solar power systems 
we follow the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in order to determine whether these arrangements have more than one unit of accounting 
according to eitf  deliverable elements in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables are separate units of accounting if the elements have standalone value to the customer  if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements is available  and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return related to delivered items 
we determined that our design and supply arrangements generally consist of two elements that qualify as separate units of accounting the provision of design and consulting services and the supply of solar power system parts and equipment 
we apply the same revenue recognition principles from sab as we use for our arrangements for the stand alone sales of products to the recognition of revenue on the parts and equipment unit of accounting of our multiple deliverable arrangements 
we recognize revenue from the design and consulting services unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop end of life collection and recycling 
at the time of sale  we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold 
we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules  which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport  the cost of freight from the solar module s installation site to a recycling center  the material  labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services 
we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled 
in the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations  we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement 
at december   our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was million 
a percent decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by million  to million  a percent increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by million  to million 
product warranties 
we provide a limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owner of our solar modules 
we also warrant to the 
table of contents owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreed upon specifications will produce at least of their initial power output rating during the first years following their installation and at least of their initial power output rating during the following years 
our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser 
we accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales  using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims  our monitoring of field installation sites and in house testing 
during the years ended december   december  and december   our estimate of our product warranty liability did not require significant adjustments 
share based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas r  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards on their grant dates 
we adopted sfas r during the first quarter of the year ended december  using the modified retrospective method of transition 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance regarding the implementation of sfas r 
in particular  sab provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in share based compensation valuation models  the classification of share based compensation expense  the capitalization of share based compensation costs and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis in filings with the sec 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant using that valuation model requires judgment 
we use the black scholes merton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options  which is consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes merton formula  require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term  expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return 
because our stock has only recently become publicly traded  we do not have a meaningful observable share price volatility  therefore  we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publicly traded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data to refer to from our own traded share price 
we estimated our options expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding 
if we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for future share based awards could change significantly from those used for past awards  even if the critical terms of the awards are similar 
higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to share based compensation determined at the date of grant 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which we expect to vest 
quarterly changes in our estimates of award forfeiture rates and further adjustments when the awards actually vest can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation 
increases to the estimated forfeiture rate will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters 
decreases in the estimated forfeiture rate will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters 
these adjustments affect our cost of sales  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative and production start up expenses 
the adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based awards that we expect to vest and further adjustments as certain awards completed their vesting period reduced our share based compensation expense by million in the year ended december  and increased our share based compensation expense by million and million in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated number of share based awards that we expect to vest and further adjustments when the awards actually vest 
valuation of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities 
our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules 
we account for any impairment of our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  we assess long lived assets 
table of contents classified as held and used  including our property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
these events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses  significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we evaluated our long lived assets for impairment during the years ended december  and december  and did not note any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying values of material long lived assets are not recoverable 
accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states  its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 
we establish liabilities for potential losses that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
once established  we adjust the liabilities when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates  and the actual cost of a legal claim  tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities  if any 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net non current amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period  we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income 
conversely  to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary  that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed  which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we do not amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and  if necessary  we would record any impairment in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation  which includes the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach methodology of valuation  which considers values of comparable businesses  to determine the fair value of our goodwill 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach 
we reported million of goodwill at december   which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from turner renewable energy  llc 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we performed our annual test of our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  and concluded 
table of contents that it was not impaired 
testing goodwill for impairment involves two steps 
the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  impairment is indicated and step two of the test must be performed 
that step involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the net fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities is attributed to goodwill  and any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value is written off as an impairment loss 
in our test during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the fair value of our solar power systems reporting unit  which contains all of our goodwill  exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent 
as a result  we concluded that there was no indication that our goodwill was impaired and that performing step two of the goodwill impairment test was not applicable 
marketable securities 
we have classified our marketable securities as available for sale and present them at fair value on our balance sheet  with gains and losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss until realized 
we determine the realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities using the specific identification cost method 
all of our available for sale marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we consider our marketable debt securities impaired when their fair value is less than their carrying value 
we subject investments identified as being impaired to further review to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired  in which case we would write down the investment to its impaired value and establish that amount as its new cost basis 
we measure the fair value of our marketable securities using quoted prices for securities with similar characteristics and other observable inputs such as interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals and we consider the effect of our counterparties credit standings in these fair value measurements 
determining the observable market values most relevant to the measurement of the fair value of marketable securities and the further counterparty credit risk adjustment to those values  if needed  requires significant judgment 
changes in market conditions can also significantly affect the fair value measurements from period to period and can cause realized values to vary significantly from previous estimates 
valuation of derivative instruments 
we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks  including currency exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and credit risk  we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we believe that there are two aspects of accounting for our derivative instruments that require us to make significant estimates and judgments measuring the fair values of the derivative instruments and applying special hedge accounting rules to some of them 
we report our derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair values 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information about how we measure the fair values of our derivative instruments 
we believe that the types of derivative instruments that we use are commonly used by many companies outside the financial services industry and have well established valuation models  which we apply 
also  we believe that there are readily available  reliable sources for the information that we need as inputs to these valuation models 
however  the selection of the valuation models and the inputs we use in them still does require us to exercise significant judgment about their relevance to our measurement  any adjustments that they may require to properly measure our particular derivative instruments and their reliability 
we also note that the amounts that we use as valuation model inputs can change significantly from one period to another as markets fluctuate 
this can cause the fair value that we estimate for any specific derivative instrument to vary significantly from one period to another 
we designate some of our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under cash flow hedge accounting  we record the portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument that offsets  within a specified range  the change in the fair value of the specified future cash flow that it hedges as a component of other comprehensive income until the hedged cash flow affects the computation of our current income 
at that time  we reclassify this effective portion of the net change in the fair value of the derivative instrument to current income 
among other things  cash flow hedge accounting requires us to test each hedging derivative instrument at the inception of the hedging relationship and at the end of each reporting period thereafter for its effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged cash flow 
if we determine that the overall hedging relationship is 
table of contents ineffective  we must discontinue cash flow hedge accounting for the derivative instrument and record all its future fair value changes in current income 
sfas also requires us to measure any portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument that is not effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged cash flow and record that measured ineffectiveness in our current income 
because of these requirements  our estimates and judgments that affect the amounts that we measure for the fair value of our derivative instruments  and the hedged cash flows  can also have a significant impact on how we present changes in those fair values in our financial statements current income versus other comprehensive income

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our international operations accounted for of our net sales during and of our net sales during  all of these international sales were denominated in euro 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales 
fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate  affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses 
in the past  most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts 
for example  our long term supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate 
for the year ended december   a change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by million 
with the expansion of our manufacturing operations into germany and the current expansion into malaysia  many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency 
our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction  cash flow and translation transaction exposure we have certain assets and liabilities  primarily receivables  investments  accounts payable including inter company transactions and debt that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the effect of short term foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on these assets and liabilities 
as of december   the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with us dollars was million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of  the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to sell euros for us dollars was million 
table of contents million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of  and the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase malaysian ringgit with us dollars was myr million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of myr 
as of december   the unrealized loss of these forward contracts was million 
these foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of months or less 
these currency forward contracts hedge third party balance sheet exposure 
if the us dollar would have weakened by  the adverse impact on our income before income taxes related to our foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell euro and malaysian ringgit would have been million and million  respectively 
cash flow exposure we have forecasted future cash flows  including revenues and expenses  denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
our primary cash flow exposures include future customer collections and vendor payments 
changes in the relevant entity s functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled 
we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows 
we account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 
we initially report the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassify it into earnings when the hedged transaction is settled 
most of our german plant s operating expenses are denominated in euros  creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales 
in addition  we purchased forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro 
as of december   the total notional value of these forward contracts was million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations 
these contracts would be marked to market on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income  net 
we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 
in the past  currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations 
for example  currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by million during and positively impacted our cash flows by million during although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations  we believe that we have increased risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system 
although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is approximately years  end users of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation 
as a result  many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their up front capital expenditure 
an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our end users to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system 
this could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales 
in addition  we believe that a significant percentage of our end users install solar power systems as an investment  funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt 
an increase in interest rates could lower an investor s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems  which  in each case  could cause these end users to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 
during  we entered into a credit facility with a consortium of banks  which bears interest at euribor plus 
as of december   we hedged our exposure to changes in euribor using interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of million million at the balance sheet close rate on december  of 

table of contents during may of  we entered into a credit facility with ikb  natixis  natixis labuan branch and ausfuhrkredit gesellschaft mbh which is denominated in euro 
the loans under fixed rate credit facility will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 
the loans under the floating rate credit facility will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at euribor plus a margin of 
in addition  we invest some of our cash in debt securities  which exposes us to interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned a pretax yield of approximately  with a weighted average maturity of months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by approximately million 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market accounts  federal and foreign agency debt and corporate debt securities 
commodity and component risk we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials  components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules 
also  some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier 
we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers  a process which could take up to months if successful  but some suppliers are unique and it may not be feasible to qualify second source suppliers 
in some cases  we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components  but these arrangements are normally of shorter duration than the term of our long term supply contracts with our customers 
as a result  we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our modules 
in addition  a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices for our raw materials and components and even a disruption in our manufacturing process 
since our selling price under our long term supply contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our long term supply contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their term  we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 
credit risk we have certain financial and derivative instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk 
these consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  investments  trade accounts receivable  interest rate swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to our financial and derivative instruments 
we place cash  cash equivalents  investments  interest rate swap agreements and enter into derivative contracts with high quality financial institutions  and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty 
we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions 
in addition  we have certain restricted investments that are exposed to credit risk 
these consist primarily of restricted investments  which are held by a subsidiary of a financial services company to fund our estimated future product collection and recycling costs 
as of december  our restricted investments with this financial services company were million 
in october we entered into credit default swaps cds against the parent company of this financial services company to protect our investment from a significant pre defined credit event to our counter party 
under a cds  a third party assumes for a fee  a portion of the credit risk related to the investment 
the cds we entered into provides protection for losses in the event of a pre defined credit event of the parent company of the financial services company up to million 
these cds expire on march  and june   respectively
