we provide comprehensive electronics design  production  product management and aftermarket services to companies in the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  industrial  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  solar  storage and telecommunications industries 
the industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing and design services to companies that utilize electronics components in their products 
the industry experienced rapid change and growth through the s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion  and  in some cases  all of their manufacturing requirements 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector at the time 
in response to this downturn in the technology sector  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
industry revenues generally began to stabilize in and companies turned to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing 
in addition  the number of industries serviced  as well as the market penetration in certain industries  by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years 
after several years of growth  our net revenues for fiscal year declined by approximately to billion as compared to billion for fiscal year this decline was largely the result of a deteriorating macro economic environment within this past year which resulted in illiquidity in the overall credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the north american  european and asian markets 
though significant uncertainty remains regarding the extent and timing of the economic recovery  we are beginning to see signs of stabilization as the overall credit markets have significantly improved and it appears that the global economic stimulus programs put in place are starting to have a positive impact  particularly in china 
we will continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change 
such economic conditions led us to implement the restructuring plan discussed below 
also  as a result of recent economic conditions  some of our customers have moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity 
this movement  and possible future movements  may negatively impact our results of operations 
we manage our business and operations in three divisions consumer  ems and ams 
we believe that these divisions provide cost effective solutions for our customers by grouping business units with similar needs together into divisions  each with full accountability for design  operations  supply chain management and delivery 
our consumer division has dedicated resources designed to meet the particular needs of the consumer products industry and focuses on cell phones and mobile products  televisions  set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers 
our ems division focuses on business sectors such as  aerospace  automotive  computing  defense  industrial  instrumentation  medical  networking  solar  storage and telecommunications businesses 
our ams division provides warranty and repair services to customers in a broad range of industries  including certain of our manufacturing customers 
we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated product return costs  generally when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors  including variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategies  and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers 
demand for our customers products depends on  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 

table of contents our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
as our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities  the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the us are denominated in local currencies 
we economically hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
see risk factors we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
we currently depend  and expect to continue to depend  upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sale to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue  risk factors most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity  risk factors our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  delay production or change their sourcing strategy and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year decreased approximately to billion compared to billion for fiscal year due to decreases in all of our sectors  except for the mobility sector and the ams division 
these decreases were largely due to the reductions in customer demand resulting from the downturn in the global macro economic environment 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce by approximately  employees in order to reduce operating expenses the restructuring plan 
these restructuring activities were intended to address market conditions and properly size our manufacturing facilities to increase the efficiencies of our operations 
based on the analysis completed to date  we currently expect to recognize approximately million in pre tax restructuring and impairment costs and reduce our world wide headcount by approximately  employees over the course of our fiscal years and we have also recorded a valuation allowance of million on certain deferred tax assets 
the restructuring charges include pre tax employee severance and termination benefit costs  contract termination costs and other related restructuring costs 
the impairment charges include pre tax 
table of contents fixed asset impairment costs  as well as valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets 
this information will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions  consultation with employees and their representatives as well as the statutory severance requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted  and the amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of factors 
based on the ongoing assessment of market conditions  it is possible that we may perform additional restructuring activities in the future 
for further discussion of this restructuring program and the restructuring and impairment costs recognized  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges and note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements

the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ended august  certain key operating results and other financial information in thousands  except per share data 
fiscal year ended august  net revenue gross profit operating loss income net loss income loss earnings per share basic loss earnings per share diluted key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results 
the following table sets forth  for the quarterly periods indicated  certain of management s key financial performance indicators 
three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory  less the days in accounts payable  accordingly  the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators 
days in accounts receivable increased one day to days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter which was primarily due to timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter 
during the three months ended may   days in accounts receivable increased four days to days from the prior sequential quarter as a result of lower utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program at the end of the quarter 
during the three months ended february   days in accounts receivable decreased eight days to days from the prior sequential quarter as a result of the timing of sales and focused efforts on cash collection during the quarter  as well as related seasonality factors 
during the three months ended november  days in accounts receivable increased four days to days from the prior sequential quarter as a result of consumer sector seasonal demand  the launch of new product volumes late in the quarter  and the reduction in the sales of receivables under our north american securitization program 
days in inventory decreased four days to days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter as a result of improved inventory management 
days in inventory remained consistent at days during the three months ended may   the three months ended february   and the three months ended november  inventory turns increased to turns during the three months ended august  from turns during the prior sequential quarters 

table of contents days in accounts payable increased three days to days during the three months ended august  from the prior sequential quarter 
days in accounts payable increased two days to days during the three months ended may  from the prior sequential quarter  decreased four days to days during the three months ended february  from the prior sequential quarter and increased one day to days during the three months ended november  from the prior sequential quarter 
these fluctuations in days in accounts payables during fiscal year were primarily a result of timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters 
the sales cycle was days during the three months ended august   days during the three months ended may   days during the three months ended february  and days during the three months ended november  the changes in the sales cycle are due to the changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
it has been difficult to make predictions and estimates based on our historical experience due to the uncertain economic circumstances present in the macro economic environment 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from the product sales of electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from product sales and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and recoverability is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage  customer inventory related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset s or asset group s are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions 
for further discussion of our current restructuring program  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 

table of contents in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair market value of the reporting unit 
we consistently determine the fair market value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples 
the use of comparative market multiples the market approach allows us to compare ourselves to companies based on valuation multiples to arrive at a fair value 
we regularly evaluate our company and our divisions relative to our competitors and we believe the judgments used to arrive at these comparable companies are reasonable 
the use of projected discounted future results discounted cash flow approach is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business and also includes a probability weighted expectation as to our future cash flows 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  and tax rates  amongst other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis  and that impact these assumptions  may result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
based upon a combination of factors  including a significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization below our carrying value  the deteriorating macro economic environment  which resulted in a significant decline in customer demand  and illiquidity in the overall credit markets  we concluded that sufficient indicators of impairment existed and  accordingly  performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the first quarter and again in the second quarter of fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal year  we determined that the goodwill related to the consumer reporting unit was impaired and recorded a preliminary non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
the income tax expense associated with the preliminary goodwill impairment charge was million 
this included a tax benefit of million for the write off of tax deductible goodwill and tax expense of million resulting from the recognition of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we no longer believe are more likely than not to be realized 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  and prior to finalizing the preliminary non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded at november   related to the consumer reporting unit  we concluded that additional impairment indicators were present 
as a result of that analysis  we determined that the goodwill related to the consumer reporting unit was fully impaired and recorded an additional non cash goodwill impairment charge of the remaining approximately million 
further  we also determined that the goodwill related to the ems reporting unit was fully impaired and recorded a preliminary non cash goodwill impairment charge of the remaining approximately million 
the income tax expense associated with the goodwill impairment was million for the fiscal quarter ended february  this included a tax benefit of million for the write off of tax deductible goodwill and income tax expense of million resulting from the recognition of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we no longer believe are more likely than not to be realized 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we finalized the valuation of the tangible and intangible assets and the allocation of fair value to the assets and liabilities of the ems reporting unit with no additional impairment charges recorded 
after recognition of the above non cash goodwill impairment charge  no goodwill remained with the consumer and ems reporting units  respectively 
the non cash goodwill impairment charge of billion for the fiscal year ended august  did not impact our cash balance or debt covenant compliance 
the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets  which for us is a trade name  is conducted during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
as a result of the impairment indicators described above  during the first quarter and again in the second quarter of fiscal year  we evaluated our trade name for impairment by comparing the discounted estimates of future revenue projections to its carrying value and determined that there was no impairment 
additionally  we noted that there were no impairment indicators present during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year significant judgments inherent in this analysis included assumptions regarding appropriate revenue growth rates  discount rates and royalty rates 
we completed the annual impairment test for goodwill  which consisted of approximately million related to the ams reporting unit  and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  which for us are our contractual agreements  customer relationships and intellectual property  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
as a result of the impairment indicators described above  during the first quarter and again in the second 
table of contents quarter of fiscal year  we tested our long lived assets for impairment and determined that there was no impairment 
additionally  no impairment indicators were present during the third or fourth quarters of fiscal year restructuring and impairment charges we have recognized restructuring and impairment charges related to reductions in workforce  re sizing and closure of certain facilities  and the transition of production from certain facilities into other new and existing facilities 
these charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management and our board of directors 
the recognition of restructuring and impairment charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
pension and other postretirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates  compensation rate increases and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits  refer to note postretirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
as discussed above  during fiscal year  we realized a tax benefit of million for the write off of tax deductible goodwill and income tax expense of million resulting from the recognition of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we no longer believe are more likely than not to be realized

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenue fiscal year ended august  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles restructuring and impairment charges goodwill impairment charges operating loss income other expense interest income interest expense loss income before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense minority interest  net of tax net loss income fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue decreased to billion for fiscal year  down from billion in fiscal year specific decreases include a decrease in the sale of display products  a decrease in the sale of networking products  a decrease in the sale of automotive products  an decrease in the sale of computing and storage products  a decrease in the sale of telecommunication products  a decrease in the sale of peripheral products  a decrease in the sale of instrumentation and medical products  and a decrease in the sale of other products 
these decreases were largely driven by reduced production levels as a result of softened customer demand due to the weakened macro economic environment 
specific increases include an increase in aftermarket services and a increase in the sale of mobility products predominately related to the production of new products with an existing customer within the sector 
generally  we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition 
accordingly  we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business 
in addition  the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following fluctuations in customer demand as a result of the weakened macro economic environment  our continuing efforts to de emphasize the economic performance of certain sectors  most specifically in the automotive and display sectors  seasonality in our business  and business growth from new and existing customers  including production of new products in the mobility sector 

table of contents fiscal year ended august  ems automotive computing and storage instrumentation and medical networking telecommunications other total ems consumer display mobility peripherals total consumer ams total foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year we currently expect our foreign source revenue to slightly increase as a percentage of net revenue over the course of fiscal year due to expansion in asia and eastern europe 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to our revenues decreasing at a higher rate than certain of our fixed costs as we continue to seek to reduce our cost structure in order to align with lower demand levels and our excess capacity given current macro economic conditions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year on an absolute dollar basis  selling general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant 
certain of our selling  general and administrative costs are generally necessary to support our business and the need for such support does not immediately change as a result of our revenues increasing or decreasing 
on a percentage basis  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  therefore  was primarily due to our revenues decreasing at a higher rate than certain of our selling  general and administrative costs as compared to the twelve months ended august  research and development 
research and development r d expenses for fiscal year decreased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease is attributed primarily to the de emphasis of original design manufacture in certain consumer sectors 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august  for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  note goodwill and other intangible assets and note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges 
a 
restructuring plan in conjunction with the restructuring plan  we currently expect to recognize approximately million in total restructuring and impairment costs  excluding valuation allowances of million on certain deferred tax assets  primarily over the course of fiscal years and of this expected total  we charged million in fiscal year to the consolidated statement of operations 
these charges related to the restructuring plan include million related to employee severance and termination benefit costs  million related to lease commitments  million related to fixed asset impairments  and million related to other restructuring costs 

table of contents these million restructuring and impairment charges related to the restructuring plan incurred through august  include cash costs totaling million  of which million was paid in fiscal year the cash costs of million consist of employee severance and termination benefit costs of approximately million  million related to lease commitments  and approximately million related to other restructuring costs 
non cash costs of approximately million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 
at august   accrued liabilities of approximately million related to the restructuring plan are expected to be paid over the next twelve months 
the remaining liability of million is expected to be paid primarily through fiscal year upon its completion  the restructuring plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately million 
the majority of these annual cost savings are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue  with a small portion being reflected as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expense 
these expected annualized cost savings reflect a reduction in employee expense of approximately million  a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million  a reduction in lease commitment costs of approximately million  a reduction of other manufacturing costs of approximately million and a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million 
of the million of expected annualized cost savings  we have realized a cumulative annual cost savings of approximately million by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year as part of the restructuring plan  we have determined that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would not be realized as a result of the contemplated restructuring activities 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance of million on deferred tax assets as a result of the restructuring plan 
the valuation allowances are excluded from the restructuring and impairment charge of million for fiscal year as they were recorded through the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations 
b 
restructuring plan upon the approval by our board of directors  we initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the restructuring plan 
we have substantially completed restructuring activities under this plan and expect to incur the remaining costs over the remainder of fiscal year with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year we recorded a reversal of restructuring and impairment costs of million during fiscal year and a charge of restructuring and impairment costs of million in fiscal year the reversal of restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal year include million related to less employee severance and termination benefit costs than originally anticipated  offset by additional lease commitment charges of million 
at august   liabilities of approximately million related to the restructuring plan are expected to be paid out over the next twelve months 
the remaining liability of million relates primarily to the charge for certain lease commitments and employee severance and termination benefits payments and is expected to be paid primarily during the remainder of fiscal year through fiscal year as of august   as a result of the restructuring activities related to the restructuring plan  we expect to avoid annual costs of approximately million that would otherwise have been incurred if the restructuring activities had not been completed 
the expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of approximately million  a reduction in depreciation expense associated with impaired fixed assets of approximately million  and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately million 
the majority of these annual cost savings will be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue  with a small portion being reflected as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expense 
these annual costs savings are expected to be offset by decreased revenues associated with certain products that are approaching the end of life stage  decreased revenues as a result of shifting production to plants located in lower cost regions where competitive environmental pressures require that we pass those cost savings onto our customers  and incremental employee related costs expected to be incurred by those plants to which the production will be shifted 
after considering these cost savings offsets  we began to realize the full net annualized cost savings of approximately million during the third quarter of fiscal year for further discussion of the restructuring programs  see note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment charge 
we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of billion for fiscal year to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill to its estimated fair value based upon the results of two interim impairment tests conducted during the first and second quarters of fiscal year we performed these impairment tests based upon a combination of factors  including a significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization below our carrying value  the deteriorating macro economic environment  which resulted in a significant decline in customer demand and illiquidity in the overall credit markets 
the total goodwill impairment charge included million in the consumer reporting segment and million in the ems reporting segment 
after recognition of these charges  no goodwill remained with the consumer and ems reporting units  respectively 
a further significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant decline in our 
table of contents expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates  however  could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis under sfas in future periods

the increase in other expense was primarily due to recognizing a loss of million on the extinguishment of million of our senior notes and recording a loss on the impairment of a note receivable for million 
this increase was primarily offset by a decrease in the loss on the sale of accounts receivable under our north american securitization program of million which was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended august   as well as a decrease in the interest rates during the period 
the net cash proceeds available at any one time under the north american asset backed securitization program was decreased from million to million during fiscal year for further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program  see note accounts receivable securitizations to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower overall interest rates during the year 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily a result of lower variable interest rates and lower utilization of the foreign asset backed securitization program during the twelve months ended august  as compared to the same period in fiscal year income taxes 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate differs from the previous period due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill and the corresponding valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets that are no longer more likely than not to be realized 
the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  primarily due to tax incentives granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  india  malaysia and poland that expire at various dates through such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply 
see risk factors we are subject to the risk of increased taxes and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase in our net revenue base year over year primarily represents stronger market share with our existing programs  organic growth from new and existing customers as vertical companies continue to convert to an outsourcing model  and additional sales related to certain recent business acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by decreased levels of production with a major customer in the mobility sector and reduced demand in certain other sectors due to a softening market 
see note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on our recent business acquisitions 
specific increases include a increase in the sale of telecommunication products  a increase in the sale of peripheral products  a increase in the sale of other products  a increase in aftermarket services  a increase in the sale of networking products  and a increase in the sale of computing and storage products 
specific decreases include a decrease in the sale of mobility products  a decrease in the sale of automotive products  a decrease in the sale of display products  and a decrease in the sale of instrumentation and medical products 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenue by industry sector expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
the distribution of revenue across our industry sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following increased business from new and existing customers  fluctuations in customer demand  seasonality  especially in the consumer industry sectors  and increased growth in the automotive  consumer  and instrumentation and medical products industry sectors as more vertical companies are electing to outsource their production in these areas 
ems automotive computing and storage instrumentation and medical networking telecommunications other total ems consumer display mobility peripherals total consumer ams total foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of net revenue for fiscal year from million of net revenue for fiscal year the percentage increase from the prior fiscal year was partially due to factors that decreased gross profit in fiscal year  but have since been resolved 
the factors that contributed to decreased gross profit in fiscal year included inefficiencies in our consumer model which adversely impacted margins  shifting to a more integrated model with one customer and shifting to a more vertical solution that integrated our green point services for another significant customer 
in addition  we have exited production of certain targeted products in the consumer sector 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the slight absolute dollar decrease was due to several factors including a million decrease in legal and accounting expenses incurred during fiscal year related to the independent stock option review that was performed  a million reversal of previously recognized stock based compensation expense as a result of a change in estimate related to performance based restricted stock awards that are no longer expected to vest  and a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense incurred during fiscal year related to certain personal tax liabilities incurred by certain option holders who have exercised section a affected options as defined under internal revenue code section a 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million as a result of green point being consolidated for a full year in fiscal year  an increase of million related to the nsn acquisition  and an increase of million stock based compensation expense associated with our annual grant of stock based awards to employees 
r d 
r d expenses for fiscal year decreased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease is attributed primarily to an increased level of customer funded design projects  along with the repositioning of certain design resources to lower cost regions 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions consummated in fiscal year  offset by certain fully amortized intangible assets

restructuring and impairment charges 
as mentioned in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of results  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we initiated the restructuring plan 

table of contents we have substantially completed restructuring activities and expect to incur the remaining costs over the course of fiscal year with certain contract termination costs to be incurred through fiscal year for fiscal year  the restructuring plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million  fixed asset impairments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million 
for fiscal year  the restructuring plan resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million  consisting of employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million  fixed asset impairments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of approximately million  offset by million of proceeds received in connection with facility closure costs 
through august   the restructuring plan has resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million 
these charges include cash costs totaling million  of which million was paid in the fourth fiscal quarter of  million was paid in fiscal year and million was paid in fiscal year the cash costs consist of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of million 
these cash costs were offset by million of cash proceeds received in connection with a facility closure 
non cash costs of approximately million primarily represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 
other expense 
we recorded other expense on the sale of accounts receivable under our north american securitization program totaling million and million for the fiscal years ending august  and  respectively 
the decrease in other expense was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of receivables sold under the program during the fiscal year ended august  for further discussion of our accounts receivable securitization program  see note accounts receivable securitizations to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower interest yields on operating cash  cash deposits and cash equivalents 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of higher overall average debt levels due to acquisition related debt being outstanding for a full fiscal year 
income taxes 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the decrease is primarily a result of increased income in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  primarily due to tax incentives  including tax holidays  granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  india  malaysia and poland that expire at various dates through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply

table of contents million decrease in inventories  a change in deferred income taxes of million principally related to valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax assets and certain other items of net cash provided by operating activities offset by a billion net loss and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments and the reduction in sales levels during fiscal year the decrease in accounts receivable was predominately attributable to a reduction in sales levels and focused efforts to improve cash collections that was partially offset by reduced utilization of our securitization program 
the decrease in inventories was primarily due to focused efforts during fiscal year to reduce inventory levels to better align with current customer demand 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million 
this consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million for investments in capacity to support the ongoing production of new programs within the mobility sector and information and technology infrastructure and million for cash payments related to recent business acquisitions 
these expenditures were offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million 
this resulted from our receipt of approximately billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements  which primarily included an aggregate of billion of borrowings under the revolving portion of the credit facility  million of borrowings under our short term indian working capital facilities and million of borrowings under the issuance of the senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of billion during fiscal year  which primarily included billion toward repayment of borrowings under the revolving portion of the credit facility  million toward repayment of borrowings under our short term indian working capital facilities and million toward the repayment of most of our senior notes

currently  we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future  from time to time  to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an asset backed securitization program with a bank  which originally provided for net cash proceeds at any one time of an amount up to million on the sale of eligible trade accounts receivable of certain domestic operations 
subsequent to fiscal year  several amendments have increased the net cash proceeds available at any one time under the securitization program up to an amount of million and extended the program until march  under this agreement  we continuously sell a designated pool of trade accounts receivable to a wholly owned subsidiary  which in turn sells an ownership interest in the receivables to a conduit  administered by an unaffiliated financial institution 
this wholly owned subsidiary is a separate bankruptcy remote entity and its assets would be available first to satisfy the claims of the conduit 
as the receivables sold are collected  we are able to sell additional receivables up to the maximum permitted amount under the program 
the securitization program requires compliance with several financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio and debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the securitization agreements 
for each pool of eligible receivables sold to the conduit  we retain a percentage interest in the face value of the receivables  which is calculated based on the terms of the agreement 
net receivables sold under this program are excluded from trade accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we continue to service  administer and collect the receivables sold under this program 
we pay a fee on the unused portion of the facility ranging between and per annum based on the average daily unused aggregate capital during the period

in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million and retained an interest in the receivables of approximately million 
in connection with the securitization program  we recognized pretax losses on the sale of receivables of approximately million  million  and million during fiscal the years ended august    and  respectively  which are recorded as other expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party for the factoring of specific trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary 
under the terms of the factoring agreement  we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable without recourse to the third party purchaser in exchange for cash 
proceeds on the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount 
the discount is recorded as a loss on the consolidated statement of operations in the period of the sale 
in april  the factoring agreement was extended for a six month period

the swaps were accounted for as a cash flow hedge under sfas the notional amount of the swaps was million 
concurrently with the pricing of the first million of the senior notes  we settled million of the swaps by our payment of million 
we also settled the remaining million of swaps during the second quarter of fiscal year by our payment of million

d during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into separate agreements with an unrelated third party for the factoring of specific trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary 
the factoring of trade accounts receivable under these agreements does not meet the criteria for recognition as a sale in accordance with sfas under the terms of these agreements  we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable to the third party purchaser in exchange for cash  however  as these transactions do not qualify as a sale  the relating trade accounts receivable are included in our consolidated balance sheets until the cash is received by the purchaser from our customer for the trade accounts receivable

the loan agreement is non interest bearing and payments are due quarterly through october at august   million is outstanding under this loan agreement 
through the acquisition of a taiwanese subsidiary in fiscal year  we assumed certain liabilities  including short and long term debt obligations totaling approximately million at the date of acquisition 
at august   approximately million of debt is outstanding under these short term mortgage and credit facilities  with current interest rates ranging from to 
at august   approximately million of fixed assets  including buildings and land  were pledged as collateral on the mortgage facility outstanding 
at august   approximately million of long term debt is outstanding and is classified as long term on the consolidated balance sheets 
the long term debt amount represents a credit facility outstanding and denominated in new taiwan dollars which will mature in fiscal year and incurs interest at a rate that fluctuates based upon changes in various base rate interest rates 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into the five year credit facility 
this agreement provides for a revolving credit portion in the initial amount of million  subject to potential increases up to billion  and provides for a term portion in the amount of million 
some or all of the lenders under the credit facility and their affiliates have various other relationships with us and our subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services  including cash management  loans  letter of credit and bank guarantee facilities  investment banking and trust services 
we  along with some of our subsidiaries  have entered into foreign exchange contracts and other derivative arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates 
in addition  many  if not most  of the agents and lenders under the credit facility held positions as agent and or lender under our old revolving credit facility and the bridge facility 
the revolving credit portion of the credit facility terminates on july   and the term loan portion of the credit facility requires payments of principal in annual installments of million each  with a final payment of the remaining principal due on july  interest and fees on credit facility advances are based on our unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by s p and moody s 
interest is charged at a rate equal to either to above the base rate or to above the eurocurrency rate  where the base rate represents the greater of citibank  na s prime rate or above the federal funds rate  and the eurocurrency rate represents the applicable london interbank offered rate  each as more fully defined in this credit agreement 
fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders  a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit  and a utilization fee to be added to the revolving credit interest rate and any letter of credit fee during any period when the aggregate amount of outstanding advances and letters of credit exceeds of the total revolving credit commitments of the lenders 
based on our current senior unsecured long term indebtedness rating as determined by s p and moody s  the current rate of interest including the applicable facility and utilization fee on a full draw under the revolving credit would be above the base rate or above the eurocurrency rate  and the current rate of interest on the term portion would be the base rate or above the eurocurrency rate 
we  along with our subsidiaries  are subject to the following financial covenants a maximum ratio of a debt as defined in the credit agreement to b consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and a minimum ratio of a consolidated ebitda to b interest payable on  and amortization of debt discount in respect of  debt and loss on sales of trade accounts receivables pursuant to our securitization program

during fiscal year  we borrowed billion against the revolving credit portion of the credit facility 
these borrowings were repaid in full during the fiscal year 
a draw in the amount of million has been made under the term portion of the credit facility and million remains outstanding at august  in addition to the loans described above  at august   we have additional loans outstanding to fund working capital needs 
these additional loans total approximately million and are denominated in euros 
the loans are due and payable within months and are classified as short term on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents g on april   we entered into a foreign asset backed securitization program with a bank conduit 
in connection with the foreign securitization program certain of our foreign subsidiaries sell  on an ongoing basis  an undivided interest in designated pools of trade accounts receivable to a special purpose entity  which in turn borrows up to million from the bank conduit to purchase those receivables and in which it grants security interests as collateral for the borrowings 
the securitization program is accounted for as a borrowing under sfas the loan balance is calculated based on the terms of the securitization program agreements 
the foreign securitization program requires compliance with several covenants including a limitation on certain corporate actions such as mergers  consolidations and sale of substantially all assets 
we pay interest at designated commercial paper rates plus a spread 
the foreign securitization program expires on march  at august   we had million of debt outstanding under the program 
in addition  we incurred interest expense of million and million in our consolidated statement of operations during the twelve months ended august  and  respectively 
at august   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  available borrowings under our credit facilities and our asset backed securitization programs 
at august  and  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants under the credit facility and our securitization programs 
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions 
it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments  changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment 
we currently anticipate that during the next twelve months  our capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million  principally for maintenance levels of machinery and equipment  machinery and equipment for new business and for information technology infrastructure upgrades 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  additional proceeds available under our accounts receivable securitization program and funds provided by operations  will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures  the payment of any declared quarterly dividends  payments for current and future restructuring activities  and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
our million us asset backed securitization program and our million foreign asset backed securitization program expire  however  in march and we may be unable to renew one or both of them 
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements  future interest on notes payable and long term debt  future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements estimated future benefit plan payments and capital commitments as of august  are summarized below 
we do not participate in  or secure financing for  any unconsolidated limited purpose entities 
we generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer 
non cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most 
purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable 
payments due by period in thousands less than after total year years years years contractual obligations notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations future interest on notes payable and long term debt operating lease obligations estimated future benefit payments to plan total contractual cash obligations a during the first fiscal quarter of  the company committed million to an independent private equity limited partnership which invests in companies that address resource limits in energy  water and materials commonly referred to as the cleantech sector 
of that amount  the company has invested million at august  the remaining commitment of million is callable over the next five years by the general partner 
as the timing of capital calls have no specified dates  this commitment has been excluded from the above table as we cannot currently determine when such commitment calls will occur 

table of contents b at august   we have million recorded as a current liability for uncertain tax positions under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the long term portion of our fin liability of million has not been included in the contractual obligations table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in various foreign countries and are  therefore  subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair market values in accordance with sfas except for certain foreign currency contracts  with a notional amount outstanding at august  of million and a fair value of million  which are recorded in prepaid and other current assets at august   we have elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required for the transactions to qualify as accounting hedges and  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at august  that do not qualify as accounting hedges was million 
the fair value of these contracts amounted to a million asset recorded in prepaid and other current assets and a million liability recorded in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
the forward contracts will generally expire in less than four months  with five months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at august  upon expiration of the contracts  the change in fair value will be reflected in cost of revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
the forward contracts are denominated in british pounds  chinese yuan renminbi  euros  hungarian forints  indian rupee  japanese yen  malaysian ringgits  mexican pesos  polish zloty  singapore dollars  taiwanese dollars and us dollars 
interest rate risk a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our domestic investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions 
we protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate these risks by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy 
the portfolio typically includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
at august   there were no significant outstanding investments 
we pay interest on several of our outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
there were million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities at august  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations
