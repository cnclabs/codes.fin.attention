part i item business maxim integrated products  inc maxim or the company and also referred to as we  our or us designs  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed signal integrated circuits  commonly referred to as analog circuits  for a large number of customers in diverse geographical locations 
the analog market is fragmented and characterized by diverse applications  numerous product variations and  with respect to many circuit types  relatively long product life cycles 
our objective is to develop and market both proprietary and industry standard analog integrated circuits that meet the increasingly stringent quality and performance standards demanded by customers 
we are a delaware corporation that was originally incorporated in california in we are headquartered in sunnyvale  california 
the mailing address for our headquarters is san gabriel drive  sunnyvale  california  and our telephone number is additional information about us is available on our website at www

we make available through our website  free of charge  our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section a or d of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec 
we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  unless we are required to do so by law 
a copy of this annual report on form k is available without charge upon written request to investor relations  maxim integrated products  inc  san gabriel drive  sunnyvale  california the mixed signal analog integrated circuit market all electronic signals generally fall into one of two categories  linear or digital 
linear or analog signals represent real world phenomena  such as temperature  pressure  sound  or speed  and are continuously variable over a wide range of values 
digital signals represent the ones and zeros of binary arithmetic and are either on or off 
three general classes of semiconductor products arise from this distinction between linear and digital signals digital devices  such as memories and microprocessors that operate primarily in the digital domain  linear devices such as amplifiers  references  analog multiplexers and switches that operate primarily in the analog domain  and mixed signal devices such as data converter devices that combine linear and digital functions on the same integrated circuit and interface between the analog and digital domains 
our strategy has been to target both the linear and mixed signal markets  often collectively referred to as the analog market 
however  some of our products are exclusively or principally digital 
while our focus continues to be on the linear and mixed signal market  our capabilities in the digital domain enable development of new mixed signal and other products with highly sophisticated digital characteristics 
risks associated with pursuing this strategy are discussed in item a risk factors 
our linear and mixed signal products serve four major end markets 
these major end markets and their corresponding market segments are noted in the table below major end market market segment industrial automatic test equipment automotive control automation electrical instrumentation medical military aerospace security utility other meters other industrial communications basestations network datacom telecom other communications consumer cell phones digital camera home entertainment appliances other consumer computing data storage financial terminals notebook computers server desktop computers peripherals other computer product quality we employ a system addressing quality and reliability of our products from initial design through wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and final shipment 
we have received iso  ts and iso certifications for all wafer fabrication  assembly  final test and shipping facilities 
reliability stress testing is performed on products manufactured and sold by maxim  based on industry standard requirements  in an effort to detect and accelerate the presence of defects that may arise over the life of a product in order to ensure the reliability of our products 
manufacturing we primarily manufacture our own wafers and  to a lesser extent  utilize third party silicon foundries to produce wafers 
the majority of processed wafers are subjected to parametric and functional testing at our facilities 
the broad range of products demanded by the mixed signal analog integrated circuit market requires multiple manufacturing process technologies 
as a result  many different process technologies are currently used for wafer fabrication of our products 
historically  wafer fabrication of analog integrated circuits has not required the state of the art processing equipment necessary for the fabrication of advanced digital integrated circuits  although newer processes do utilize and require such state of the art facilities and equipment 
in addition  hybrid and module products are manufactured using a complex multi chip technology featuring thin film  laser trimmed resistors and other active or passive components 
we primarily rely on our own fabrication technologies and facilities to implement such heightened manufacturing requirements  although we rely on unaffiliated manufacturing subcontractors to a lesser degree 
during fiscal years  and  most of our wafer production requirements occurred at one of our four owned wafer fabrication facilities consisting of the following facility location fiscal year acquired beaverton  oregon san jose  california dallas  texas san antonio  texas at the end of fiscal year  we ceased wafer fabrication efforts in our dallas  texas facility 
in fiscal year  we entered into a five year supply agreement with seiko epson corporation epson under which epson has manufactured some of our mixed signal semiconductor products 
these products are manufactured by epson under rights and licenses using our proprietary technology at epson s fabrication facility located in sakata  japan 
in fiscal years   and the products manufactured by epson represented  and of our total wafer production  and we expect to continue to rely primarily on our own domestic facilities to meet our wafer production needs 
we have a separate wafer bump manufacturing facility located in dallas  texas 
we use this facility to manufacture products that utilize chip scale packaging csp or wafer level packaging wlp 
csp or wlp collectively referred to as csp enables integrated circuits to be attached directly to a printed circuit board without the use of a traditional plastic package 
in addition  we utilize independent subcontractors to perform wafer bump manufacturing to the extent we do not have the internal capacity or capabilities to perform such services 
once wafer manufacturing has been completed  wafers are generally sorted in order to determine which integrated circuits on each wafer are functional and which are defective 
we currently perform wafer sort  final test and shipping activities at two facilities located in cavite  the philippines  and chonburi province  thailand 
our finished products ship directly from either cavite  the philippines or chonburi province  thailand to customers worldwide or to other company locations for sale to end customers or distributors 
in addition  we utilize independent subcontractors to perform wafer sort 
integrated circuit assembly is performed by foreign assembly subcontractors  located in the philippines  malaysia  thailand  china  taiwan  singapore  south korea and japan  where wafers are separated into individual integrated circuits and assembled into a variety of packages 
after assembly has been completed  the majority of the assembled product is shipped back to our facilities located in cavite  the philippines or chonburi province  thailand where the packaged integrated circuits undergo final testing and preparation for customer shipment 
in addition  we utilize independent subcontractors to perform final test 
we currently perform substantially all of our module assembly operations in our batangas  philippines facility 
the batangas  philippines facility also performs wafer singulation and tape and reel of bumped csp or wlp wafers 
sales and marketing we market our products worldwide through a direct sales and applications organization and through our own and other unaffiliated distribution channels to a broad range of customers in diverse industries 
our reliance on unaffiliated distributors was minor compared to our direct sale efforts 
our products typically require a sophisticated technical sales effort 
our sales organization is divided into domestic and international regions 
distributors and direct customers generally buy on an individual purchase order basis  rather than pursuant to long term agreements 
certain distributors have agreements with us which allow for price protection on certain inventory if we lower the price of our products 
certain distributor agreements also generally permit distributors to exchange a portion of certain purchases on a periodic basis 
as is customary in the semiconductor industry  our distributors may market products which compete with our products 
sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates 
the agreements generally permit distributors to exchange a portion of their purchases on a periodic basis 
see critical accounting policies in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k  which contains information regarding our revenue recognition policy 
we operate in one reportable segment the design  development  marketing and manufacturing of a broad range of linear and mixed signal integrated circuits 
our primary distributor  avnet electronics  accounted for approximately of net revenues in fiscal year distributors are not end customers  but rather serve as a channel of sale to many end users of the company s products 
no single customer accounted for more than of net revenues in fiscal years and no single product accounted for more than of net revenues in fiscal years  and based on customers ship to locations  international sales accounted for approximately  and of net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see note  segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k 
backlog at june  and june   our current quarter backlog was approximately million and million  respectively 
we include in our backlog customer released orders with firm schedules for shipment within the next months 
as is customary in the semiconductor industry  these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to the customers 
in addition  our backlog includes orders from domestic distributors for which revenues are not recognized until the products are sold by the distributors 
accordingly  we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as a measure of future revenues 
all backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future us distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments 
research and development we believe that research and development is critical to our future success 
objectives for the research and development function include product definition and development of proprietary products  design of parts for high yield and reliability  development of manufacturing processes and advanced packaging  and development of hardware and software to support the acceptance and design in of our products in the end customer s system 
our research and development plans require engineering talent and tools for process technologies  test development  packaging development  product definition  electronic design automation eda  circuit design  software development and applications support 
research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see research and development under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for more information 
competition the mixed signal analog integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive  and virtually all major semiconductor companies presently compete with  or conceivably could compete with  some portion of our business 
we believe the principal elements of competition include technical innovation  service and support  time to market  product performance and features  quality and reliability  product pricing and delivery capabilities  customized design and applications  business relationship with customers  and manufacturing competence and inventory management 
our principal competitors include  but are not limited to  analog devices  inc  intersil corporation  linear technology corporation  national semiconductor corporation and texas instruments inc in addition  we expect increased competition in the future from other emerging and established companies 
for further description of competitive factors that may affect our future business  please refer to the section entitled our operating results may be adversely affected by increasing competition contained in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
patents  licenses  and other intellectual property rights we rely upon both know how and patents to develop and maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests 
our products interface with other products  which may require us to obtain licenses that we do not have 
we hold and pursue intellectual property  including patents  trademarks and trade secrets as appropriate for our markets and technologies 
it is our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented  though we may elect  in appropriate cases  not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if other protection  such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret  is considered more advantageous 
in addition  we have registered certain of our mask sets under the semiconductor chip protection act of  as amended 
we hold a number of patents worldwide with expiration dates ranging from to we have also registered several of our trademarks with the us patent and trademark office and in foreign jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that any patent will be issued on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it 
employees as of june   we had  employees 
environmental regulations to date  our compliance with foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  competitive or financial position 
however  we could be subject to fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of our operations if we fail to comply with present or future statutes and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes 
executive officers for information regarding our current executive officers  please see part iii  item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations 
please also see the introductory section of this annual report on form k entitled forward looking statements for additional discussion regarding forward looking statements 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results have been adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions  including the current economic downturn the recent global economic crisis has caused a tightening in the credit markets  increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy  and extreme volatility in credit  equity and fixed income markets 
these macroeconomic developments have negatively affected our business  operating results and financial condition 
the current economic environment could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us  or delay paying us  for previously purchased products 
accordingly  reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable may increase 
in addition  weakness in the market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties 
this would further increase our credit risk exposure and  potentially  cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers 
the turmoil in the global credit markets may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
if global economic and market conditions  or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets  remain uncertain  persist  or deteriorate further  we may experience material adverse effects on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may have difficulties implementing a new enterprise resource planning system  which may adversely affect our operations and financial reporting we currently expect to implement a new enterprise resource planning erp system as part of our ongoing efforts to improve and strengthen our operational and financial processes and our reporting systems 
any difficulties or delays encountered in the implementation or operation of our new erp system or any difficulties in the operation of our current erp system could cause us to fail to meet customer demand for our product or could delay our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations which  in turn  could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
political conditions could materially affect our revenues and results of operations political instability or terrorist activity in various regions of the world and other global events could impact economic activity which  in turn  could lead to a contraction of customer demand or a disruption in our operations 
in the past  our assembly contractors in malaysia  south korea  thailand and the philippines have been impacted by political disorders  labor disruptions  criminal activities and natural disasters 
we have been affected by these problems in the past and none has materially affected our results of operations to date 
however  similar problems in the future or not yet materialized consequences of past problems  could affect deliveries of our product to our customers  possibly resulting in substantially delayed or lost sales and or increased expenses 
the occurrence of political conflicts or economic crises in countries where our sort  assembly  test  shipping operations and manufacturing subcontractors or distribution channels or customers are located could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which could adversely impact our common stock price we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our operating results have in the past  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of numerous factors  some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following fluctuations in demand for our products and services  in part due to changes in general economic conditions and specific economic conditions in the computer and semiconductor industries  reduced visibility into our customers spending plans and associated revenue  the level of price and product competition in our product markets  the impact of the current adverse economic and credit environment on our customers  channel partners  and suppliers  including their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures  the overall movement toward industry consolidations among our customers and competitors  market acceptance of new products and product enhancements  announcements and introductions of  and transitions to  new products by us or our competitors  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements  introduced by us or our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products and enhancements in a timely manner  and our levels of expenditure on research and development and sales and marketing programs 
our products may fail to meet new industry standards or requirements and the efforts to meet such industry standards or requirements could be costly many of our products are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major systems manufacturers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards or requirements  we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial results 
our manufacturing operations may be interrupted or suffer yield problems we manufacture most of our wafer production requirements internally 
given the nature of our products  it would be very difficult and costly to arrange for independent manufacturing facilities to supply such products 
any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or a third party foundry as a result of fire  natural disaster  unavailability of electric power or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the manufacture and design of integrated circuits is highly complex 
we may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  equipment malfunctioning  construction delays  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues or increases in fixed costs 
to the extent we do not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields or there are delays in wafer fabrication  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  operating expenses related to increases in production capacity may adversely affect our operating results if revenues do not increase proportionately 
our independent distributors and sales representatives may terminate their relationship with us or fail to make payments on outstanding accounts receivable to us  which would affect our financial results a portion of our sales is realized through independent electronics distributors that are not under our control 
these independent sales organizations generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us 
we generally require foreign distributors to provide a letter of credit to us in an amount equal to the credit limit set for accounts receivable from such foreign distributors 
the letter of credit provides for collection on accounts receivable from the foreign distributor should the foreign distributor default on their accounts receivable to us 
where credit limits have been established above the amount of the letter of credit  we are exposed for the difference 
we do not require letters of credit from any of our domestic distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors 
the inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
termination of a significant distributor  whether at our or the distributor s initiative  could be disruptive to our current business 
our operating results may be adversely affected by increasing competition we experience intense competition from a number of companies  some of which have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  and marketing resources than us while others have greater technical resources and proprietary intellectual property rights than us 
the principal elements of competition include product performance  functional value  quality and reliability  technical service and support  price  diversity of product line and delivery capabilities 
we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors  although we may be at a disadvantage in comparison to larger companies with broader product lines and greater technical service and support capabilities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
our dependence on assembly and test subcontractors may cause delays beyond our control in delivering products to our customers we rely on assembly and csp packaging subcontractors located in the philippines  malaysia  thailand  china  singapore  taiwan  south korea and japan to separate wafers into individual integrated circuits and to package them 
none of the assembly subcontractors we currently use are affiliated with us 
reliability problems experienced by our assemblers or the inability to replace an assembly subcontractor could cause serious problems in delivery and quality resulting in potential product liability to us 
such problems could impair our ability to meet our revenue plan in the fiscal period impacted by the disruption 
failure to meet the revenue plan may materially adversely impact our results of operations 
we perform substantially all of our final testing at our facilities in the philippines and thailand 
any prolonged inability to utilize one of our testing facilities as a result of fire  natural disaster  political instability  unavailability of electric power or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
any disruptions in our sort  assembly  test or shipping operations or in the operations of our manufacturing subcontractors  including  but not limited to  the inability or unwillingness of any of our subcontractors to produce adequate supplies of processed wafers  integrated circuit packages or tested product conforming to our quality standards or their inability to provide timely delivery of products or services required by us  could adversely affect the continuity of product supply as well as damage our reputation  relationship and goodwill with affected customers 
this  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  finding alternate sources of supply or initiating internal wafer processing for these products may not be economically feasible 
shortage of raw materials or supply disruption of such raw materials could harm our business the semiconductor industry has experienced a very large expansion of fabrication capacity and production worldwide over time 
as a result of increasing demand from semiconductor  solar and other manufacturers  availability of certain basic materials and supplies  such as raw wafers and silicon on insulator wafers  chemicals  gases  polysilicon  silicon wafers  ultra pure metals  lead frames and molding compounds  and of subcontract services  like epitaxial growth  ion implantation and assembly of integrated circuits into packages  has been limited from time to time over the past several years  and could come into short supply again if overall industry demand exceeds the supply of these materials and services in the future 
we purchase materials and supplies from many suppliers  some of which are sole sourced 
if the availability of these materials and supplies is interrupted  we may not be able to find suitable replacements 
in addition  from time to time natural disasters can lead to a shortage of some of the above materials due to disruption of the manufacturer s production 
we devote continuous efforts to maintain availability of all required materials  supplies and subcontract services 
however  we do not have long term agreements providing for all of these materials  supplies and services  and shortages could occur as a result of capacity limitations or production constraints on suppliers that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our production requirements 
environmental liabilities could force us to expend significant capital and incur substantial costs various foreign and united states federal  state  and local government agencies impose a variety of environmental regulations on the storage  handling  use  discharge and disposal of certain chemicals  gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
there can be no assurance  however  that interpretation and enforcement of current or future environmental regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us 
any failure by us to not adequately control the storage  handling  use  discharge or disposal of regulated substances could result in fines  suspension of production  alteration of wafer fabrication processes and legal liability  which may materially adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may impact our ability to compete effectively we rely upon both know how and patents to develop and maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology  reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests 
moreover  the laws of foreign countries generally do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the united states  and we may encounter problems in protecting our proprietary rights in those foreign countries 
other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes  and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products  if these patents are found to be valid 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses  if required  upon commercially reasonable terms or at all 
from time to time  we have received  and in the future may receive  notice of claims of infringement by our products on intellectual property rights of third parties 
if one or more of our products or processes were determined to infringe on any such intellectual property rights of a third party  a court might enjoin us from further manufacture and or sale of the affected products 
we would then need to obtain a license from the holders of the rights and or to re engineer our products or processes in such a way as to avoid the alleged infringement 
in the past  it has been common in the semiconductor industry for patent holders to offer licenses on reasonable terms and rates 
although the practice of offering licenses appears to be generally continuing  in some situations  typically where the patent directly relates to a specific product or family of products  patent holders have refused to grant licenses 
in any of those cases  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any necessary license on commercially reasonable terms acceptable to us or at all or that we would be able to re engineer our products or processes to avoid infringement 
an adverse result in litigation arising from such a claim could involve an injunction to prevent the sales of a material portion of our products  the reduction or elimination of the value of related inventories and the assessment of a substantial monetary award for damages related to past sales  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may experience losses related to intellectual property indemnity claims we provide intellectual property indemnification for certain customers  distributors  suppliers and subcontractors for attorney fees and damages and costs awarded against these parties in certain circumstances in which our products are alleged to infringe third party intellectual property rights  including patents  registered trademarks and copyrights 
in certain cases  there are limits on and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments  if any  that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements 
to date  we have not been required to pay significant amounts for intellectual property indemnification claims 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not have significant financial exposure under those intellectual property indemnification obligations 
we are a party to a purported class action securities litigation arising out of our past stock option granting practices the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows a purported class action securities lawsuit is pending against the company  its former chief executive officer now deceased  its former chief financial officer  and its former treasurer  in connection with the company s past stock option grant practices 
the lawsuit is still in its preliminary stages and its ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows for a particular period as well as the trading price for our securities 
litigation is also time consuming  expensive and disruptive to our normal business operations  and outcomes are difficult to predict 
the defense of this lawsuit has resulted and will continue to result in significant legal expenditures and diversion of our management s time and attention from business operations 
for further discussion on legal matters see legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
business interruptions from natural disasters could harm our business we operate our business in worldwide locations 
our facilities in california  which include our corporate  research and manufacturing facilities  are in close proximity to known earthquake fault zones 
in addition  our locations and partner fabrication facilities in japan and southeast asia are susceptible to damage from earthquakes  tsunamis and other natural disasters 
in the event of a natural disaster  we may suffer a disruption in our operations which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our financial condition  operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected in the event of a catastrophic loss for which we are self insured we are primarily self insured with respect to most of our risks and exposures 
based on management s assessment and judgment  we have determined that it is generally more cost effective to self insure these risks 
the risks and exposures we self insure include  but are not limited to  fire  property and casualty  natural disasters  product defects  political risk  general liability  theft  counterfeits  patent infringement  certain employment practice matters and medical benefits for many of our domestic united states employees 
we also maintain insurance contracts with independent insurance companies that provide certain of our employees with health medical and dental benefits  worker s compensation coverage  long term disability income coverage  life insurance coverage and fiduciary insurance coverage for employee and company funds invested under the employee retirement income and security act 
in addition  we maintain officer and director liability coverage and certain property insurance contracts with independent insurance companies 
should there be catastrophic loss from events such as fires  explosions or earthquakes or other natural disasters  among many other risks  or adverse court or similar decisions in any area in which we are self insured  our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to warranty claims and product liability we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability suits in connection with reliability problems which may be experienced by our customers 
our products are used by varying industries which include the automotive and medical industries 
failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to both the end product in which our device has been placed and to the user of such end product 
if a product liability claim is brought against us  the cost of defending the claim could be significant and any adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we manufacture and sell products into many global jurisdictions where our efforts to contractually limit liability for certain damages  including consequential  indirect and non proximately caused damages may not be enforceable or may be found by a court to not apply in a particular situation 
as we continue to partner with certain customers we may be required to accept increasing exposure for liability including product liability 
we believe these relationships with key customers will continue to increase 
we continue to attempt to structure our customer relationships to reduce such liability exposures 
damages for such liability claims could materially adversely impact the company financially 
should we choose to not enter into such relationships  our revenues and financial operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may be liable for additional production costs and lost revenues to certain customers with whom we have entered into customer supply agreements  if we are unable to provide a specific part at a certain quantity and product quality we enter into contracts with certain customers whereby we commit to supply quantities of specified parts at a predetermined scheduled delivery date 
the number of such arrangements continues to increase as this practice becomes more commonplace 
should we be unable to supply the customer with the specific part at the quantity and product quality desired on the scheduled delivery date  the customer may incur additional production costs 
in addition  the customer may incur lost revenues due to a delay in receiving the parts necessary to have the end product ready for sale to its customers or due to product quality issues which may arise 
under the customer supply agreements  we may be liable for direct additional production costs or lost revenues 
if products were not shipped on time or were quality deficient  we may be liable for penalties and resulting damages 
such liability  should it arise  and or our inability to meet these commitments to our customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could damage our relationship  reputation and goodwill with the affected customers 
we may pursue acquisitions and investments that could harm our operating results and may disrupt our business we have made and will continue to consider making strategic business investments  alliances and acquisitions we consider necessary to gain access to key technologies that we believe will augment our existing technical capability and support our business model objectives 
acquisitions  alliances and investments involve risks and uncertainties that may unfavorably impact our future financial performance 
if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful  we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own 
we may also need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
any of the foregoing  and other factors  could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
in addition  because acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
if we fail to enter into future vendor managed inventory arrangements or fail to supply the specific product or quantity under such arrangements  the results of our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted we enter into arrangements with certain original equipment manufacturers oems and electronic manufacturing services ems partners to consign quantities of certain products within close proximity of the oems and ems partners manufacturing location 
the inventory is physically segregated at these locations and we retain title and risk of loss related to this inventory until such time as the oem or ems partner pulls the inventory for use in their manufacturing process 
once the inventory is pulled by the oem or ems partner  title and risk of loss pass to the customer  at which point we relieve inventory  recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold 
the specific quantities to be consigned are based on a forecast provided by the oem or ems partner 
generally  the arrangements with the oems and ems partners provide for transfer of title and risk of loss once product has been consigned for a certain length of time 
we believe these arrangements will continue to grow in terms of number of customers and products and will increase in proportion to consolidated net revenues 
it is our belief that revenues from such arrangement will eventually become significant to consolidated net revenues 
should we be unable or unwilling to enter into such agreements as requested by oems or ems partners  our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted 
should we be unable to supply the specific product and quantity needed by the oem or ems partner as reflected in their forecast  we may be liable for damages  including but not limited to  lost revenues and increased production costs which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
should we supply product in excess of the oems or ems partners actual usage  any inventory not consumed may become excess or obsolete which would result in an inventory write off that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
in the future  the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general economic and market conditions and in response to quarter to quarter variations including but not limited to the following our anticipated or actual result of operations  announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors  anticipated or actual operating results of our customers  peers or competitors  technological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors  conditions in our four major markets  the commencement or outcome of litigation or governmental investigations  change in ratings and estimates of our performance by securities analysts  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  dividend changes  changes in our capital structure  including any decision we make in regard to the repurchase of our common stock  management changes  our inclusion in certain stock indices  our inclusion in a national stock exchange  our ability to maintain compliance with the sec reporting requirements  and other events or factors beyond our control 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  particularly semiconductor companies 
in some instances  these fluctuations appear to have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies 
any such fluctuation could harm the market price of our common stock 
our financial results may be adversely affected by increased tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates  including the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  recent changes in our global structure that involve an increased investment in technology outside of the united states to better align asset ownership and business functions with revenues and profits  the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including write offs of acquired in process research and development and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions  changes in available tax credits  changes in share based compensation  changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws  and changes in generally accepted accounting principles  and the repatriation of non us earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes 
we are subject to taxation in various countries and jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine tax liabilities on a worldwide basis 
our future tax rates could be affected by various changes in the composition of earnings in countries with different tax rates  changes in our global structure  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or changes in the tax laws 
we expect our fiscal year effective tax rate will be materially higher than and that in subsequent years the effective tax rate will begin to decline as our new global strategy becomes fully operational 
any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
potential income tax liabilities under section a of the internal revenue code and other payroll taxes in the past  a number of our outstanding stock option awards were granted at exercise prices below the fair market value of our stock on the appropriate accounting measurement date 
many of these options are potentially subject to option holder excise tax under section a of the internal revenue code and  as applicable  similar excise taxes under state law or foreign law 
in fiscal year  we took action to cure certain options from exposure under section a 
however  there can be no assurance that such action cured all potential circumstances in which section a would apply 
should it be determined that excise taxes under section a were to apply and we decide to reimburse option holders for such taxes  our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
also we have determined that certain payroll taxes  interest and penalties may apply under various sections of the internal revenue code  various state tax statutes  and tax statutes in various foreign jurisdictions 
maxim has reviewed these potential liabilities and accrued the estimated probable amount of the liability 
there can be no assurance that our accruals covered all potential circumstances in which additional payroll taxes  interest and penalties would apply 
should it be found that additional payroll taxes  interest and penalties would apply  our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we may be materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations we conduct our manufacturing and other operations in various worldwide locations 
a portion of operating costs and expenses at foreign locations are paid in local currencies 
many of the materials used in our products and much of the manufacturing process for our products are supplied by foreign companies or by our foreign operations  such as our test operations in the philippines and thailand 
approximately  and of our net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  were shipped to foreign locations 
accordingly  both manufacturing and sales of our products may be adversely affected by political or economic conditions abroad 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation are routinely proposed in the united states and certain foreign countries 
a change in current tariff structures or other trade policies could adversely affect our foreign manufacturing or marketing strategies 
currency exchange fluctuations could also decrease revenue and increase our operating costs and the cost of components manufactured abroad  and the cost of our products to foreign customers or decrease the costs of products from our foreign competitors 
we are subject to us customs and export regulations we are subject to us customs and export regulations  including us international traffic and arms regulations and similar laws  which collectively control import  export and sale of technologies by us companies 
failure to comply with such regulations may result in civil and criminal enforcement  including monetary fines and possible injunctions against shipment of product  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our chief executive officer  our other executive officers  and key management and technical personnel  particularly our experienced engineers and business unit managers  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or several of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or should we be unable to continue to attract  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
should we lose an engineer who is key to a project s completion during the course of a particular project  the project s completion may be delayed 
this delay could negatively affect customer relationships and goodwill and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti takeover provisions that may discourage  delay or prevent a hostile change in control of our company our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions applicable to such shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
any such issuance might discourage  delay or prevent a hostile change in control of our company
