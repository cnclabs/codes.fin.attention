item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in this item includes forward looking statements and should be read in the context of the risks  uncertainties and other variables referred to below under the caption forward looking statements 
business operations overview following development of a larger and more diverse franchise in and  which resulted in significant premium growth  the company encountered challenges in despite efforts to operate profitably  the emergence of a claims ratio higher than previously estimated  resulting primarily from our rapid growth  caused a loss for the year ended december  throughout  the company implemented actions to address these challenges and improve the claims and expense ratios  including the following implementation of multiple rate increases in most markets to attempt to strengthen pricing adequacy while maintaining desirable business segments  adoption of market initiatives to eliminate sources of unprofitable business  whether derived from specific markets or coverages or originated by agents with identifiable unprofitable business  upgrade of claims systems  procedures and personnel  including practices intended to accelerate the recognition and resolution of exposure throughout the claims process  from initial recording of claims to their ultimate resolution  continuing consolidation of functions and personnel in the dallas headquarters office  to reduce expenses where practicable while maintaining or improving customer service  deferral of entry into new markets  and continued settlement of runoff claims in an orderly manner 
we also sold a former subsidiary general agents  which is not utilized in the nonstandard personal automobile business  in a transaction in which the company realized a net gain of million 
the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared with net loss of million for the year ended december  in  the company recorded net realized losses of approximately million  approximately million related to write downs for other than temporary declines in fair value of various investments including million from auction preferred securities backed by preferred stock of the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corp 
freddie mac 
net premiums earned were million and million in and  respectively  and gross premiums written were million and million in and  respectively 
as of december   the statutory surplus was million  after a million dividend paid to gan  compared to million as of december  the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses stood at million and million at december  and  respectively  of which unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses attributable to ongoing nonstandard personal automobile lines was million and million  respectively

index to financial statements the company believes that the improved c cae ratio for nonstandard personal auto insurance discussed below is the result of numerous factors  including the improvements in pricing and underwriting  upgrades of claims systems  procedures and personnel  and actions to closely monitor and address emerging claims trends 
the company believes that it should be able to achieve additional improvement in this c cae ratio  subject to the significant risks and uncertainties identified in this report see item a 
risk factors 
the company limited its nonstandard personal auto insurance business to florida until the fourth quarter of  when it began writing policies in texas 
the company began writing policies in arizona and nevada in  in california  with an independent managing general agency  in  and in south carolina in  and we entered new mexico in the first quarter of the company markets its policies through approximately  independent agency locations in arizona  florida  nevada  new mexico  south carolina and texas and one general agency in california that markets through approximately  insurance broker locations 
beginning in  significant growth has been realized as a result of these expansion activities  which has increased the operating leverage  the claims ratio and the overall financial and operational risk profile of the company 
the following table presents selected financial information years ended december  dollar amounts in thousands gross premiums written net premiums earned loss before federal income taxes federal income tax expense net loss gaap c cae ratio gaap expense ratio gaap combined ratio c cae is an abbreviation for claims and claim adjustment expenses  stated as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the expense and combined ratios do not reflect expenses of the holding company which include interest expense on the note payable and subordinated debentures 
commissions  change in deferred acquisition costs  underwriting expenses and operating expenses insurance subsidiaries only are offset by agency revenues and are stated as a percentage of net premiums earned 
we believe rate increases  selective reduction in the agency force and the effects of the slowing economy are the main reasons for the decrease in gross premiums written and net premiums earned for the comparative years 
the decrease in the c cae ratio in from the periods was primarily due to a smaller amount of unfavorable development for claims occurring in prior accident years on the nonstandard personal auto lines and improvement in the accident periods as compared to the accident periods 
the company believes it is pursuing a strategy that has the potential to build a larger  competitively distinctive and successful franchise in the nonstandard personal auto business over time and is endeavoring to manage its investments and risks to achieve this result 
these risks and other challenges  occurring in rapidly changing economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and claims environments  are greater than and in some cases different from those to which the company previously was subject in writing nonstandard personal auto insurance 
the company s operating and financial results vary from period to period as a result of numerous factors inherent in the insurance business  many of which are affected by such changes 

table of contents 
index to financial statements discontinuance of commercial lines on february   the company announced its decision to cease writing commercial insurance due to continued adverse claims development and unprofitable results 
the discontinuance of writing commercial lines resulted in the company ceasing to be approved to write insurance in several states  however  this state action has not materially restricted the geographic expansion of the company s nonstandard personal auto lines thus far 
the company continues to settle and reduce its inventory of commercial lines claims 
at december   there were claims associated with the company s runoff book outstanding  compared to as of december  as of december   in respect of its runoff lines  the company had million in net unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses c cae compared to million as of december  for the periods presented  the company has recorded favorable development in unpaid c cae from the runoff lines with the settlement and reduction in the inventory of commercial lines claims 
see results of operations claims and claim adjustment expenses 
due to the long tail and litigious nature of these claims  the company anticipates it will take a substantial number of years to complete the adjustment and settlement process with regard to existing claims and the additional claims it expects to receive in the future from its past business writings 
most of the remaining claims are in suit and the company s future results may or may not be impacted either negatively or positively based on its ability to settle the remaining claims and new anticipated claims within its established reserve levels 
results of operations the discussion below primarily relates to the company s insurance operations  although the selected consolidated financial information appearing elsewhere is on a consolidated basis

revenue gross premiums written in decreased as compared to we believe the primary reasons for the decrease to be the result of rate increases  selective reduction in the agency force and the effects of the slowing economy 
the following table presents gross premiums written by region for the years ending december  dollar amounts in thousands region southeast florida  south carolina south central texas southwest arizona  new mexico  nevada west california total each of the regions  except for southeast  recorded premium declines in from the percent of premium decrease increase by region for from is as follows southeast  south central  southwest and west 
in the southeast region  we believe product enhancements  rate adjustments and expanded marketing efforts accounts for the increase in gross premiums written 
net premiums earned decreased in from primarily as a result of gross premiums written in the first six months of being below the comparable period in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements net investment income decreased  in primarily due to the decrease in bonds available for sale  which provide higher returns than short term investments and the decline in interest rates 
at december   bonds available for sale comprised of investments versus at december  the return on average investments was in versus in the company recorded net realized losses of  in and net realized gains of  in approximately  of the net realized losses in related to write downs for other than temporary declines in fair value of various investments  including approximately  from auction preferred securities backed by preferred stock of fannie mae and freddie mac that are included in preferred stock see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item of this annual report 
the net realized gains in were primarily due to the sale of general agents 
see significant corporate transactions sale of general agents 
variability in the timing of net realized capital gains and losses should be expected 
agency revenues decreased  in primarily as a result of the decrease in writings in agency revenues are primarily fees charged on insureds premiums due  as discussed previously 
expenses claims and claim adjustment expenses decreased  in and the c cae ratio was in versus in the runoff lines recorded favorable development for prior accident years of approximately  and  during and  respectively 
the c cae ratio for nonstandard personal auto was and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the c cae ratio was primarily due to less unfavorable development for claims occurring in prior accident years of approximately  in versus  in also contributing to the lower c cae ratio was improvement in accident year as compared the accident year 
the following presents the unfavorable development for claims occurring in prior accident years for each of the three major regions during southeast region primarily florida  south central region texas  southwest region primarily arizona and nevada  new business and the entry into new territories and product lines  associated with the company s growth beginning in  has generally produced higher claims and greater uncertainty in determining reserves than more seasoned in force business  see item a 
risk factors 
the unfavorable development for prior accident years for nonstandard personal auto in is primarily the result of actual and projected increases in severity associated with bodily injury liability 
the company s growth and the associated risks and uncertainties see item a 
risk factors made it difficult to estimate ultimate claims liabilities  and the unfavorable development occurred as the company revised previous estimates to reflect current claims data 
the unfavorable development for prior accident years includes approximately  recognized in relating to extra contractual claims  in which claimants seek to recover amounts significantly in excess of applicable policy limits 
in  the company incurred several extra contractual claims of approximately  primarily related to prior accident years see item a 
risk factors litigation may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents 
index to financial statements claims for extra contractual liability arise when a claim is originally denied or the claimant asserts that a claim has been handled inappropriately  and the claimant further asserts that such denial or allegedly inappropriate response was improper or in bad faith 
in such cases  which tend to arise in cases involving serious injury or death  it is not unusual for the amount of the claim to exceed by a substantial amount the policy limits that would otherwise be applicable 
when the company becomes aware of such a potential claim  it typically consults with outside counsel and  if appropriate  seeks to settle the claim on terms as favorable as possible in light of all the relevant circumstances 
the amounts required for settlement of such claims  and the potential award if a case cannot be settled on acceptable terms  vary widely depending on the specific facts of the claim  the applicable law and other factors 
we believe it is reasonably likely that our loss costs could increase or decrease by from current estimates  as remaining claims are recorded and resolved 
loss costs reflect the incurred loss per unit of exposure and are the product of frequency and severity 
a increase or decrease in our loss costs would result in unfavorable or favorable development of million based on c cae incurred as of december  
this estimate of sensitivity is informational only  is not a projection of future results and does not take into account possible effects of extraordinary litigation events such as class action claims 
with regard to environmental and product liability claims  the company has an immaterial amount of exposure 
the company did not provide environmental impairment coverage and excluded pollution and asbestos related coverages in its policies 
a portion of the company s remaining claims is related to construction defects 
inflation impacts the company by causing higher claim settlements than may have originally been estimated 
inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results 
policy acquisition costs include commissions  premium taxes  marketing and underwriting expenses and the amortization of the premium deficiency 
the expenses are charged to operations over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
the decrease of  in was primarily due to decreases in commission  marketing expenses and the amortization of the premium deficiency for expected underwriting losses on the south central business that was recorded in deferred policy acquisitions costs in commissions decreased primarily as a result of the decline in premiums 
the decrease in marketing expenses occurred primarily as a result of reducing the number of territory managers by expanding individual territory manager s geographical area in order to become more efficient 
commissions are paid to the independent agents based upon premium writings 
the marketing expenses are primarily salaries  telephone and travel expenses of our territory managers who oversee the efforts of the agents within a geographical area 
their time is focused on the supervision  relationship management and support of existing agents and recruiting new agents  as well as actively soliciting new business from these agents 
accordingly  these costs vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies 
the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned was and for and  respectively 
underwriting and operating expenses increased  in from primarily due to an increase in software amortization and software maintenance 
underwriting and operating expenses as a percent of net premiums earned and agency revenues were for and for the increase in the ratio was due to the expense increases and the decline in premium earned 
the decrease in interest expense of  is primarily due to the decline in the month london interbank offered rate for us dollar deposits libor during federal income taxes the company recorded deferred tax expense in as a result of increasing the valuation allowance for deferred federal income tax asset 
the company considered it appropriate to increase the valuation allowance  see liquidity and capital resources net operating loss carryforwards

gan needs cash during primarily for administrative expenses and interest on the subordinated debentures and the note payable 
gan has approximately million in cash and marketable securities that can be used for general corporate purposes 
another source of cash to meet obligations is statutorily permitted dividend payments from its insurance subsidiary  which requires approval from the texas department of insurance see note to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this annual report 
for  cash dividends of million were paid to gan 
gan believes the cash available from its short term investments and dividends from its insurance subsidiary  if permitted  should be sufficient to meet its expected obligations for net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
see note j federal income taxes in notes to consolidated financial statement appearing under part financial information item financial statements of this annual report for further discussion 
as a result of losses in prior years  as of december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes aggregating  these net operating loss carryforwards of     and  if not utilized  will expire in    and  respectively 
as of december   the tax benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards was  which is calculated by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of against the net operating loss carryforwards of  the company considers available evidence  both objective and subjective  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in  the company increased the amount of the valuation allowance by  resulting in an allowance on the gross deferred tax asset of  in making this determination  the company considered all available evidence  including the fact that the company incurred a taxable loss in and had incurred  as of december   a cumulative taxable loss for the three years then ended 
as of december  and  the net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance was  and  and the valuation allowance was  and  respectively 
the company does not record a tax valuation allowance relating to the net unrealized losses on investments  excluding equity securities because it is more likely than not that these losses would reverse or be used in future periods 
the company has the ability and it is the company s intent to fully recover the principal  which could require the company to hold these securities until their maturity  therefore  the company considers the impairment to be temporary 
subsidiaries  principally insurance operations the primary sources of the insurance subsidiary s liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  net investment income and maturing investments 
the short term investments and cash are intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without selling fixed maturity investments 
at december   the insurance subsidiary held short term investments and cash that the insurance subsidiary believes is at adequate liquidity for the payment of claims and other short term commitments 

table of contents 
index to financial statements with regard to liquidity  the average duration of the investment portfolio is approximately years 
the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at december  was  below amortized cost  before taxes see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item of this annual report 
various insurance departments of states in which the company operates require the deposit of funds to protect policyholders within those states 
at december  and  the balance on deposit for the benefit of such policyholders totaled  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for versus cash used for operating activities of  for the change in cash as a result of operating activities between the periods was primarily attributable to a lower c cae paid ratio in than in investments and cash increased in primarily as a result of cash from operations offset by the decline in fair value of the investment securities 
at december   of the company s investments were rated investment grade 
the average duration was approximately years  including approximately of the investments that were held in short term investments 
the company classifies its bond securities as available for sale 
the net unrealized loss associated with the investment portfolio was  net of tax effects at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item of this annual report 
the company has performed a detailed review of the securities in the investment portfolio and has recorded approximately  in net realized losses on certain securities that were considered other than temporarily impaired 
the company  at this time based upon information currently available and management s evaluation and intent to hold securities to maturity if necessary to recover the cost  expects to recover the net unrealized loss of  net of tax effects and considers this impairment to be temporary 
premiums receivable increased primarily due to the increase in premium writings for the six months ended december  over the six months ended december  this balance is comprised primarily of premiums due from insureds 
most of the policies are written with a down payment and monthly payment terms of up to four months on six month policies 
the company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of december  and  respectively  which it considers adequate 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts was due primarily to an increase in over thirty day receivables 
ceded unpaid c cae decreased as a result of the settlement of claims subject to the excess casualty and quota share reinsurance agreements 
this balance represents unpaid c cae which have been ceded to reinsurers under the company s various reinsurance agreements  other than the reserve reinsurance cover agreement 
these amounts are not currently due from the reinsurers but could become due in the future when the company pays the claim and requests reimbursement from the reinsurers 
deferred policy acquisition costs are principally commissions  premium taxes  marketing expenses and some underwriting expenses which are deferred 
the increase of  in from was primarily due to the amortization in of a  premium deficiency that was previously recorded in for expected underwriting losses on the south central business 
the premium deficiency amortized to zero as a result of significant improvement in the expected c cae ratio in the south central region 
deferred federal income taxes include temporary differences and the tax asset from net operating loss carryforwards less a valuation allowance that fully reserves these two items  see liquidity and capital resources net operating loss carryforwards 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in unrealized losses on investments  excluding common stocks

index to financial statements funds held under reinsurance agreements decreased primarily due to the release of amounts held in trust by the new york insurance department for the benefit of policyholders of general agents 
under the terms of the sale  general agents returned these amounts to the company when they were released by the insurance department 
unpaid c cae increased primarily as a result of unfavorable development recorded for the nonstandard personal automobile lines  which were offset with favorable development from the runoff lines 
as of december   the company had  in net unpaid c cae unpaid c cae of  less ceded unpaid c cae of 
this amount represents management s best estimate of the ultimate liabilities 
the significant operational changes we have recently made in the nonstandard personal auto claims adjustment process and changing claims trends increase the uncertainties which exist in the estimation process and could lead to inaccurate estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense 
the reserve estimates were made by our in house actuarial staff 
an analysis provided by an independent actuarial firm was used to corroborate the reserve selections made by the in house actuarial staff 
as of december  and  in respect of its runoff lines  the company had  and  respectively  in net unpaid c cae 
historically  the company has experienced significant volatility in its reserve projections for its commercial lines 
this volatility has been primarily attributable to its commercial automobile and general liability product lines 
on february   the company announced it had decided to discontinue writing commercial lines insurance due to continued adverse claims development and unprofitable results 
the company has been settling and reducing its remaining inventory of commercial claims 
see business operations discontinuance of commercial lines 
as of december   runoff claims remained versus at december  the average runoff claim reserve was approximately  per claim and  per claim at december  and december   respectively 
unearned premiums increased primarily as a result of the increase in premium writings for the six months ended december  over the six months ended december   mentioned previously 
premiums payable  commissions payable and reinsurance balances payable all decreased due to a fronting reinsurance arrangement that was reducing throughout accounts payable increased primarily due to increases in return premiums due policyholders  florida hurricane assessments and bonuses payable based on production 
note payable decreased as a result of the company paying the principal balance down to  in november in conjunction with an amendment to the credit agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appear in item of this annual report 
other liabilities increased primarily due to unearned interest income on an investment security purchased in the first quarter of under the terms of this security the company has received all of the interest income and will recognize it over the life of the security 
cash overdraft increased primarily due to the company maintaining less cash in the bank accounts and instead investing those funds in short term investments

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this annual report 
investments investments are stated at fair value and are based on prices quoted in the most active market for each security  the fair value of comparable securities  discounted cash flow models or similar methods with changes in fair value recorded as a component of comprehensive income 
the specific identification method is used to determine costs of investments sold 
provisions for possible losses are recorded only when the values have experienced impairment considered other than temporary by a charge to realized losses resulting in a new cost basis of the investment 
our securities are issued by domestic entities and are backed either by collateral or the credit of the underlying issuer 
factors such as an economic downturn  disruptions in the credit markets  a regulatory change pertaining to the issuer s industry  deterioration in the cash flows or the quality of assets of the issuer  or a change in the issuer s marketplace may adversely affect our ability to collect principal and interest from the issuer 
both equity and fixed income securities have been affected over the past several years  and may be affected in the future  by significant external events 
credit rating downgrades  defaults  and impairments may result in write downs in the value of the investment securities held by the company 
the company regularly monitors its portfolio for pricing changes  which might indicate potential other than temporary impairments  and performs reviews of securities with unrealized losses 
in such cases  changes in fair value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer  such as financial conditions  business prospects or other factors  or ii market related factors  such as interest rates 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of variability of estimates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements fair value measurements the company s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in sfas no 
the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation  gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates in the sfas no 
hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the company s significant market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to assess 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severities  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect the company s own estimates as to the assumptions that market participants would use 
valuation of investments the company receives pricing from independent pricing services  and these are compared to prices available from sources accessed through the bloomberg professional system 
the number of available quotes varies depending on the security  generally we obtain one quote for level investments  one to three quotes for level investments and one to two quotes  if available  for level investments 
if there is a material difference in the prices obtained  further evaluation is made 
market prices and valuations from sources such as the bloomberg system  trace and dealer offerings are used as a check on the prices obtained from the independent pricing services 
should a material difference exist  then an internal valuation is made 
this occurs primarily with mortgage backed securities where the matrix pricing methodology used by the independent pricing service is too broad in its categorizations 
this often involves differences in reasonable prepayment assumptions or significant differences in performance among issuers 
in some cases  other external observable inputs such as credit default swap levels are used as input in the fair value analysis 
fixed maturities for u 
s 
treasury  u 
s 
government and corporate bonds  the independent pricing services obtain information on actual transactions from a large network of broker dealers and determine a representative market price based on trading volume levels 
for asset backed and mortgage backed instruments  the independent pricing services obtain information on actual transactions from a large network of broker dealers and sorts the information into various components  such as asset type  rating  maturity  and spread to a benchmark such as the us treasury yield curve 
these components are used to create a pricing matrix for similar instruments 
all broker dealer quotations obtained are non binding 
for short term investments classified as level and level  the company uses prices provided by independent pricing services 
the preferred stock classified as level are all auction rate preferred shares  and the company used broker dealer quotes which are non binding 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company uses the following hierarchy for each instrument in total invested assets the company obtains a price from an independent pricing service 
if no price is available from an independent pricing service for the instrument  the company obtains a market price from a broker dealer or other reliable source  such as bloomberg 
the company then validates the price obtained by evaluating its reasonableness 
the company s review process includes quantitative analysis ie  credit spreads and interest rate and prepayment fluctuations and initial and ongoing evaluations of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value and comparing the fair value estimates to its knowledge of the current market 
if a price provided by a pricing service is considered to be materially different from the other indications that are obtained  the company will make a determination of the proper fair value of the instrument based on data inputs available 
in order to determine the proper sfas no 
classification for each instrument  the company obtains from its independent pricing service the pricing procedures and inputs used to price the instrument 
the company analyzes this information  taking into account asset type  rating and liquidity  to determine what inputs are observable and unobservable in order to determine the proper sfas no 
level 
for those valued internally  a determination is made as to whether all relevant inputs are observable or unobservable in order to classify correctly 
revenue recognition and premiums receivable premiums and policy fees are recognized as earned on a pro rata basis over the period the company is at risk under the related policy 
agency revenues are primarily fees charged on insureds premiums due 
these fees are earned over the terms of the underlying policies 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written and policy fees which are applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force 
premiums receivable consist of balances owed for coverages written with the company 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts consists of premiums receivables over thirty days past due 
deferred policy acquisition costs and policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs are principally commissions  premium taxes  marketing expenses and some underwriting expenses which are deferred 
policy acquisition costs are principally commissions  premium taxes  marketing expenses  some underwriting expenses and the change in deferred policy acquisition costs that are charged to operations over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
the company utilizes investment income when assessing recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected claims and claim adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated investment income 
at december   a premium deficiency of  net of anticipated investment income  was recognized against deferred policy acquisition costs for expected underwriting losses on the south central business 
at december   there was no premium deficiency that was required to be recognized

index to financial statements data processing software costs associated with software developed or purchased for internal use are capitalized based on sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and other related guidance 
capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software and payroll for employees directly associated with  and who devote time to  the development of the internal use software 
costs incurred in development and enhancement of software that do not meet the capitalization criteria  such as costs of activities performed during the preliminary and post implementation stages  are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred in development and enhancements that do not meet the criteria to capitalize are activities performed during the application development stage such as designing  coding  installing and testing 
the critical estimate related to this process is the determination of the amount of time devoted by employees to specific stages of internal use software development projects 
we review any impairment of the capitalized costs on a periodic basis 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired 
the goodwill recorded is related to the acquisition of the lalande group 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized but rather is subject to an annual impairment test  or earlier if certain factors are present  based on its estimated fair value 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in future periods 
these procedures require gan to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit  compare the results to its carrying value and record the amount of any shortfall as an impairment charge 
gan performed this test as of december  and  using a variety of methods  including estimates of future discounted cash flows 
the test results indicated that there was no impairment loss at december  or unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses an insurance company generally makes claims payments as a result of accidents involving the risks insured under the insurance policies it issues 
months and sometimes years may elapse between the occurrence of an accident  reporting of the accident to the insurer and payment of the claim 
insurers record a liability for estimates of claims that will be paid for accidents reported to them  which are referred to as case reserves 
in addition  since accidents are not always reported promptly upon occurrence and because the assessment of existing known claims may change over time with the development of new facts  circumstances and conditions  insurers estimate liabilities for such items  which are referred to as incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
we maintain reserves for the payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses for both case and ibnr under policies written by the insurance company subsidiary 
these claims reserves are estimates  at a given point in time  of amounts that we expect to pay on incurred claims based on facts and circumstances then known 
the amount of case claims reserves is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding the claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of claim 
the amount of ibnr claims reserves is estimated on the basis of historical information and anticipated future conditions by lines of insurance and actuarial review 
reserves for claim adjustment expenses are intended to cover the ultimate costs of settling claims  including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims 
inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the process of establishing claims reserves is imprecise and reflects significant judgmental factors 
in many liability cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured claim and the settlement of the claim 
the actual emergence of claims and claim adjustment expenses may vary  perhaps materially  from the company s estimates thereof  because a estimates of liabilities are subject to large potential revisions  as the ultimate disposition of claims incurred prior to the financial statement date  whether reported or not  is subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred eg  jury decisions  court interpretations  legislative changes even after coverage is written and reserves are initially set that broaden liability and policy definitions and increase the severity of claims obligations  changes in the medical condition of claimants  public attitudes and social economic conditions such as inflation  b estimates of claims do not make provision for extraordinary future emergence of new classes of claims or types of claims not sufficiently represented in the company s historical data base or which are not yet quantifiable  and c estimates of future costs are subject to the inherent limitation on the ability to predict the aggregate results of future events 
in addition to the factors described above that are generally applicable to property and casualty insurers  our ability to estimate claims reserves accurately is subject to risks and uncertainties arising out of the recent history and growth of the company 
these factors are discussed in more detail in item a of this annual report  risk factors 
the following are particularly significant factors that limit our ability  as compared with a more mature insurer with a larger and more stable book of business  to estimate claims reserves accurately our growth strategy has entailed increased financial and operational risks and other challenges that are greater than and different from those to which we have previously been subject as the nature of our business has changed and grown 
generally  new business produces higher claim ratios than more seasoned in force business  and this factor is likely to be magnified to the extent that we enter new states and market areas 
furthermore  it amplifies the importance of our ability to assess any new trends timely and accurately and respond effectively 
pricing decisions based on assumed loss ratio in new states and markets  involving different claims environments  distribution sources and customer demographics  must necessarily be made without the same level of experience and data that is available in existing markets 
our growth required additional personnel resources  including management and technical underwriting  claims and servicing personnel  relationships with agents and vendors with whom we have not previously done business  and additional dependence on operating systems and technology 
as a result  we often do not have as much reliable historical information about costs and trends in claims as would an insurer with more experience in the markets in which we have grown 
we may not have historical results for new markets  or the historic development of reserves for claim and claim adjustment expense may not accurately reflect future trends 
for example  these estimates are subject to new classes or types of losses not sufficiently represented in historical data or not discernible from the data available to us  and our inability to predict or recognize future events 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we continue to make significant operational changes in management of our claims administration to accelerate the recognition and resolution of claims 
these changes may result in an increase in the amount of aggregate claim settlements and cause our ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense to increase in comparison to prior periods 
in addition  changing claims trends increase the uncertainties which exist in the estimation process and could lead to inaccurate estimates of claim and claims adjustment expense 
ultimate liability may be greater or less than current reserves 
the company monitors reserves using new information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques which are discussed below

these assumptions were also important historically in estimating claims reserves in the runoff business but  as discussed below  the decline in the number of remaining runoff claims has made conventional actuarial methods less useful and has resulted in our basing such estimates primarily on case by case evaluations of individual claim files 
we rely on several key assumptions regarding the existence of consistency or a discernible trend in the following factors historical information used to prepare prior expected loss ratios the rate at which claims are settled or closed historical information regarding claims frequency the level of case reserve adequacy the actuarial staff monitors accident quarter data  seeking to identify whether these assumptions have remained consistent and  if deviations are identified  to adjust reserves to take them into account by making qualitative and quantitative modifications to reflect such deviations 
this process necessarily involves the exercise of judgment in assessing the impact of changes from the patterns indicated by the assumptions noted above 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the key assumptions identified above are in turn based on additional underlying assumptions regarding numerous internal and external factors  which often vary for different states  programs and coverage groups  for different accident periods and for different actuarial estimation methodologies 
internal factors include  but are not limited to  the experience level of our claims department personnel  changes in claims department processes  and changes in underwriting standards and rules 
external factors include  but are not limited to  claim severity  claim frequency  inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property  inflation in the cost of medical services  legislative activities  regulatory changes  judicial changes  and litigation trends 
in analyzing claims data for the fourth quarter of  it became apparent that the underlying accident quarter data reflected variances from historical patterns and required further analysis 
based on that analysis  we made adjustments to account for these variances  as follows assumption change from prior periods and nature of adjustment the rate at which claims are settled or closed the trend that had been identified in continued and accelerated in  and we made adjustments to take this into account

these changes can affect development patterns  so that historical patterns may not be reflective of future patterns

rate of subrogation and salvage recovery during we realized that the historical recovery pattern established by our southeast claims operation was not applicable to recoveries in states other than florida 
we attempted to take this into consideration in our estimates by modifying our subrogation and salvage loss development factors and use of actuarial judgment 
the law of large numbers applies to selecting development patterns  ie the confidence of a point estimate is improved by increasing the amount of data used to develop the estimate  however  the data must be reasonably homogeneous  and exhibit little variation over time 
changes associated with the assumptions listed above affect the homogeneity of our data  and the variance associated with the loss development factors derived from the data 
this implies that the variance around our point estimate has increased over time  or that the confidence interval around our point estimate has widened over time 
this in turn implies there is greater volatility associated with our point estimate and we attempted to take this uncertainty into consideration with our estimates for the fourth quarter of and for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements methodologies we utilize somewhat different processes for the estimation of reserves in the runoff line and in the nonstandard personal automobile business 
for our runoff lines  however  the remaining number of claims has declined to the point that conventional actuarial methods are of less utility than during the period in which the number of active claims provided more complete statistical data 
accordingly  during we ceased using conventional actuarial methods in our estimates for runoff claims and relied exclusively on evaluations of individual claim files 
this methodology is not used for our personal lines business 
in both personal lines and commercial runoff business  we utilize the same procedures for estimating reserves on a quarterly basis as we do annually 
historically  the independent actuarial consulting firm that we retain had the responsibility for making the reserve estimate used in our financial statements 
however  we changed our procedures beginning with the financial statements for the third quarter of and subsequent quarterly and annual periods 
in our revised procedures  the reserve estimates are made for each period by our in house actuarial staff  and we do not rely upon the review by the independent actuarial firm to estimate the amount of our gaap reserves 
however  that firm provides analysis as requested 
the actuarial procedures we follow are described in detail below 
the reserve estimates are developed based on review and analysis of accident quarter data 
once the reserve levels have been estimated  management makes appropriate entries 
these estimates were set forth in a detailed presentation to the audit committee of the board of directors  together with underlying statistical information on which the estimates are based 
the audit committee met each quarter with management and engaged in a detailed discussion regarding the reserve selections and underlying statistical data 
specific methodologies runoff lines within runoff commercial business  the different lines of business each have somewhat different development characteristics  which we take into account in making reserve estimates  as follows commercial auto most states in which we wrote policies have two year statutes of limitation 
because we ceased writing new business in  no new claims are expected to be incurred 
general liability generally  new claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitation 
however  we continue to receive new claims for alleged construction defects  even though we have included an exclusion for such liability in general liability policies since we respond to any claims that are asserted 
specialty lines all policies we wrote are on a claims made basis  so we do not expect any additional claims 
personal umbrella because coverage is related to the resolution of claims in underlying insurance policies  development tends to occur over a relatively long time period 
we do not expect additional claims 
however  as noted above  in recent reporting periods the estimates for all runoff claims have been based primarily on case by case evaluations of individual claim files as the number of claims has fallen to the point that conventional actuarial methods have become less useful 

table of contents 
index to financial statements specific methodologies nonstandard personal automobile insurance for private passenger auto business  all coverages are considered short tailed  as we primarily write minimum limits business primarily six month policies  and approximately two thirds of our ultimate liabilities are realized within months 
for this business  we analyze development patterns separately by state for each state in which we write business  and within each state  by each separate line of coverage we offer in that particular state 
we further analyze patterns for each accident quarter to ascertain whether development patterns are changing over time 
analyzing our data in this way allows us to group data in homogeneous sets  while maximizing the degree of credibility for each data set where limited data are available 
for states and or coverages where the data are limited  we also consider development patterns from other markets in which we write business that have more credible amounts of data and which have similar policy limits 
we employ various statistical processes to estimate our unpaid claims and cae 
our actuarial staff performs quarterly analyses on multiple unique  homogenous data subsets to produce estimates of the aggregate unpaid claims and cae 
we analyze the data separately for each of the states in which we write business  for each type of coverage group written  and by accident quarter 
we apply the actuarial methodologies outlined below with respect to each of these data subsets to establish separate point estimates for ibnr claims 
we then aggregate all of the separate point estimates to develop our best estimate of our overall unpaid claims and cae 
development patterns in the personal auto business are somewhat unique by state  since each state has varying policy limits  laws establishing liability  and litigation environments 
development patterns also vary by line of coverage  as liability claims traditionally take longer to settle than physical damage claims 
finally  development patterns can vary by accident quarter as changes have occurred and are expected to continue within our claims department  including the effects of implementation of a new claims management system 
we believe that these changes resulted in an acceleration of exposure recognition and in ultimate claim settlement 
our expansion into different geographical areas within each state has caused our mix of business to change  and the credibility associated with data for each accident quarter has changed over time 
as a result  our development patterns exhibit a greater variance than the development patterns for a stable  larger and more mature book of business  and we recognize this volatility in our analysis of the data 
for private passenger auto business  incurred but not reported reserves include provisions in the aggregate for the following claims that have occurred  but have not been reported to us 
claims that have been reported to us  but have not been recorded on our system  and a case reserve has not been established yet 
claims that are closed  but may be re opened for payment additional payments at a future date 
claims that are known and recorded in our system  but may have development beyond the case reserve established when the claim was first reported 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we compute unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense excluding claims department expense ibnr for the above four provisions on a combined basis  by first estimating ultimate claims and claim adjustment expense cae amounts for each accident quarter  and then subtracting from these amounts the cumulative paid and case reserves on known claims for each accident quarter 
there are several methods we utilize to estimate ultimate c cae amounts paid claim development method incurred claim development method bornheutter ferguson paid method bornheutter ferguson incurred method in addition  ultimate claim counts are estimated using closed and reported claim count data 
ultimate claims and cae estimates are divided by ultimate claim count estimates to determine an ultimate claim severity  which provides a reasonability check for our ultimate c cae amounts 
if severities are in line with expectations  we have an additional degree of confidence in our estimates 
the methods listed above assume that the influences that affect the development patterns for each accident quarter will remain constant over time 
because of this  selection of development patterns that will apply to current open claims and claims incurred but not reported must consider several factors 
these include  but are not limited to  the impact of inflation on claim costs and changes in the rate of inflation  the rate and level at which our claims adjusters make payments and settle claims and any changes in this rate or level  changes in the adequacy or method used to establish case reserves  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in judicial decisions  legislation changes  and other factors 
changes in any of these factors imply that development patterns are not remaining constant over time one key assumption in the methods used to estimate ultimate liability 
when the rate at which adjusters make payments and settle claims has accelerated over time  ultimate loss estimates developed using the methods employed above may overstate true projected ultimate liabilities  thus adjustments that take these changes in to consideration are utilized 
various methods are used to adjust for these changes including  but not limited to  adjustments that take into consideration changes in exposure recognition  the rate of claims closure and changes in case reserve adequacy as well as tail factor analysis and actuarial judgment 
unpaid claims department expenses are estimated using a cost per claim approach 
under this approach historical paid claims department expense data are divided by the historical number of claim activity transactions 
it is assumed that the expense associated with settling a liability claim is twice that of settling a physical damage claim  since liability claims are typically more complex 
it is also assumed that there are two activities creating expenses associated with pure ibnr claims the cost to open the claim and the cost to settle and close the claim  while only one activity is associated with claims already open the cost to settle and close the claim 
the cost per activity is multiplied by the total estimated future activities to arrive at an estimate of future claims department expense for all claims that have occurred prior to the evaluation date 
variability of claims reserves traditionally  use of multiple methodologies produces a cluster of estimates with modest dispersion in the indicated possible outcomes 
however  due to the changes the company has experienced as outlined above  use of the methodologies cited above produced conflicting results and wider bands of indicated possible outcomes 
such bands do not necessarily constitute a range of outcomes  nor do we calculate a range of outcomes 
if there is a significant variation in the results generated by different actuarial methodologies  our actuarial staff further analyzes the data using additional techniques 
these processes may include making adjustments to the key assumptions underlying the methodologies  using additional generally accepted actuarial estimation methodologies  and applying actuarial judgment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in arriving at each individual point estimate of reserves for ibnr claims and cae in each separate data subset  our actuarial staff considers the likely predictive value of the various methodologies employed in light of internal and external variables that may impact the reserves 
for each data subset in each accident quarter  the point estimate selected is not necessarily one of the points produced by any particular methodology utilized  but may be another point that takes into consideration each of the points produced by the several loss methodologies used and is based on actuarial judgment 
for example  the current accident quarter may not have enough paid claims data to rely upon  leading our actuarial staff to conclude that an incurred development methodology provides a better estimate than a paid development methodology 
in such a case  more weight would be given to an incurred methodology for that particular accident quarter 
as noted above in the discussion of the methodologies we use in setting reserves for our runoff business  the decline in the number of outstanding claims has made traditional actuarial techniques less useful in determining our estimated liabilities  and the estimates for runoff claims have been based primarily on case by case evaluations by the claims department of developments in individual claim files 
accordingly  we generally do not depend on assumptions about historical claims development in making these estimates  and it would not be feasible to devise any means of testing the sensitivity of our estimates 
in determining our reserve estimates for nonstandard personal automobile insurance  for each financial reporting date we record our best estimate  which is a point estimate  of our overall unpaid claims and cae for both current and prior accident years 
because the underlying processes require the use of estimates and professional actuarial judgment  establishing claims reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
as our experience develops and we learn new information  our quarterly reserving process may produce revisions to our previously reported claims reserves  which we refer to as development  and such changes may be material 
we recognize favorable development when we decrease our previous estimate of ultimate c cae  which results in an increase in net income in the period recognized 
we recognize unfavorable development when we increase our previous estimate of ultimate losses  which results in a decrease in net income in the period recognized 
accordingly  while we record our best estimate  our claims reserves are subject to potential variability 
we believe it is reasonably likely that our loss costs could increase or decrease by from current estimates  as remaining claims are recorded and resolved 
loss costs reflect the incurred loss per unit of exposure and are the product of frequency and severity 
a increase or decrease in our loss costs would result in unfavorable or favorable development of million assuming the size of the company remains constant 
this estimate of sensitivity is informational only  is not a projection of future results and does not take into account possible effects of extraordinary litigation events such as class action claims 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
deferred income tax items are accounted for under the asset and liability method which provides for temporary differences between the reporting of earnings for financial statement purposes and for tax purposes  primarily deferred policy acquisition costs  the discount on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses  net operating loss carry forwards and the nondeductible portion of the change in unearned premiums 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates 
in  the company increased the amount of the valuation allowance by  resulting in an allowance on the gross deferred tax asset of  in making this determination  the company considered all available evidence  including the fact that the company incurred a taxable loss in and had incurred  as of december   a cumulative taxable loss for the three years then ended
