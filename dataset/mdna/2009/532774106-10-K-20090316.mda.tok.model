description of our business strategy we are dedicated to building value for our shareholders by leveraging each of our stations trusted talent  news and promotional resources to increase our revenues and cash flow  and lead the industry in the convergence of local broadcast television and digital media 
our key strategic and operating goals include a increase our share of the local television advertising market and attract new audiences for our multiplatform product offerings  b cultivate new business and generate greater advertising  digital and other revenues  c restructure our business to realize cost efficiencies and streamline operations  and d produce more news on a basis for our web  mobile and television outlets  using fewer resources 
the principal components of our strategy include preserve our local news leadership 
we operated the number one or number two local news station in of our markets 
for the year ended december  our stations are committed to a localist approach  which sustains our strong news positions and enhances our brand equity in the community 
this year  we leveraged our top rated news and local programming to capture a significant portion of our markets political revenues 
we have been recognized for our local news expertise and have won many awards during the past year  including several emmy  associated press  edward r 
murrow and other local and regional awards 
also in  the paley center for media  in partnership with the national academy of television arts sciences and the television bureau of advertising  named twenty three local television programs for inclusion in the paley center s permanent national collection 
two of our television stations  wivb tv in buffalo and wish tv in indianapolis  each had four programs chosen to become part of the nation s foremost public archive of television and radio programming 
we believe this exemplifies the quality of work we produce 
expand product offerings 
our principle assets include market leading news and other locally produced programs  top rated syndicated programs and a suite of new media products  including streaming video  local search and mobile applications 
our new media teams are focused on embracing new technologies and developing better ways to connect with our viewers and our advertisers beyond television 
through our own innovation  as well as partnerships with other companies that utilize cutting edge technology to engage audiences  we are expanding our new media product offerings and multiplatform distribution 
focus on a multiplatform sales approach 
given our strong local station brands and market leading news and sales expertise  we capture substantial audience share in most of the markets we serve 
our strategy is to convert that audience share into an even greater share of advertising revenues through a fully integrated sales organization that focuses on a multi platform sales approach 
our sales teams specialize in creating more advanced marketing opportunities for our clients by integrating television and new media to reach a broad and dynamic audience 
as a result of our evolving sales culture  we are often one of the top stations in our markets for local and national advertising revenue  as well as market share 
secure subscriber fees from pay television operators 
local broadcast stations reach nearly of us television households through carriage on cable  telecommunications and satellite multi channel video systems competition from satellite and telecommunications companies  combined with our strong local and national programming  provides us with compelling negotiating positions to obtain fair compensation for our channels 
by the end of  we reached agreements with every major cable  telecommunications and satellite company in the markets we serve

table of contents become the local online destination 
our new media strategy focuses on engaging audiences around our strong brands and across multiple media channels 
in  we partnered with fox interactive media to redesign our television stations web sites and unveil key web site features  including a new video player that is user friendly and engaging  new weather features  map this programming  new social networking tools  a centralized content management system for seamless content flow and sharing between markets  customized news delivery and user engagement tools 
today  we operate more than unique web sites  serve nearly two billion advertising impressions and offer a growing portfolio of internet based products and services that provide traditional and new audiences around the clock access to our trusted local news and information 
most of our local web sites rank in our markets for time on site  averaging nearly minutes we will continue to focus on the depth and breadth of our content in order to become the local online destination for news and information in our markets  as well as look to expand our new media platform through mobility  short message service sms and interactive television 
continue to improve our operating efficiencies 
we have achieved company wide operating efficiencies through economies of scale in the purchase of programming  ratings services  research services  national sales representation  capital equipment and other vendor services 
in addition  we operate two regional television technology centers that have centralized engineering  operations and administration for multiple stations at a single location 
in indianapolis and springfield  we currently service nine stations and five stations  respectively 
we plan to further increase the productivity of these regional centers and incorporate more stations and functions into these centers in order to decrease expenses and further improve our efficiency 
evolve to a modern newsroom with multimedia reporting and production 
a current initiative is to improve our newsgathering and production process by sharing resources and multitasking 
we are transitioning to journalists that have a wide range of skills  including video camera operation  writing and editing 
multitasking is an important component to the modern newsroom and allows our journalists to connect better with the final product and claim more responsibility  resulting in a higher quality story and more content at a lower cost than the traditional approach 
we believe our modern newsrooms create a unique and instantaneous reporting culture that drives cost reduction and efficiency 
launch new digital services 
we have allocated resources to building our digital broadcast facilities and we are evaluating a number of potentially attractive new video and data program services that utilize the full capacity of our digital signals 
in our larger markets where we have two digital channels  we believe this is a particularly strong platform with which to launch these new services 
we expect to continue funding several research and development efforts in this area over the coming years to determine which new business applications are most advantageous for us

december  
table of contents principal sources of revenue local  national and political advertising revenues local  national and political advertising  net of agency commissions  represented approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we receive these revenues principally from advertising time sold in our local news  network and syndicated programming 
advertising rates are based upon a variety of factors  including size and demographic makeup of the market served by the television station  a program s popularity among television viewers  number of advertisers competing for the available time  availability of alternative advertising media in the station s market area  our station s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area  our station s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting  and effectiveness of our sales force 
network compensation the three oldest networks  abc  cbs and nbc  had historically made cash compensation payments for our carriage of their network programming 
however  in accordance with prevailing trends in our industry  our recent agreements with these networks now reflect a reduction and eventual elimination of network compensation payments to us and or require us to pay compensation to the network 
the newer networks  such as fox  cw and mynetworktv  provide less network programming  pay no network compensation and  in some instances  require us to pay network compensation 
however  these newer networks provide us with more advertising inventory to sell than abc  nbc or cbs 
barter revenues we occasionally barter our unsold advertising inventory for goods and services that are required to operate our television stations 
we also acquire certain syndicated programming by providing a portion of the available advertising inventory within the program  in lieu of cash payments 
digital revenues we generate digital revenues from advertising produced by our television stations internet web sites and from retransmission consent fees received from cable  satellite and telecommunications companies for the rights to carry our analog and high definition signals in their pay television services to consumers 
other revenues we receive other revenues from sources such as renting space on our television towers  renting our production facilities  copyright royalties and providing television production services 
sources and availability of programming we program our television stations from the following program sources news and general entertainment programming that is produced by our local television stations  network programming  
table of contents syndicated programming off network programs  such as the simpsons or everybody loves raymond  and first run programs  such as oprah  judge judy or wheel of fortune  paid programming arrangements where a third party pays our stations for a block of time  generally in one half hour or one hour time periods to air long form advertising or infomercials  and local weather station we provide a hour weather channel to local cable systems in certain of our television markets 
locally produced news and general entertainment programming our stations produce an aggregate of hours of local news programming per week that we broadcast on all but two of our stations 
we believe that successful local news programming is an important element in attracting local advertising revenues 
in addition  our news programs which have had historically high ratings and strong viewership  have served as strong lead ins for other programs and have created strong local station brands in each of our local communities 
local news programming also allows us greater control over our programming costs

the program service differs from a broadcast network in that it is closer to a television syndication business 

table of contents network programming all of our stations are affiliated with one of the national television networks 
our network affiliation agreements provide a local station certain exclusive rights and an obligation  subject to certain limited preemption rights  to carry the network programming 
while the networks retain most of the advertising time within their programs for their own use  the local station also has the right to sell a limited amount of advertising time within the network programs 
other time periods  which are not programmed by the networks  are programmed by the local station  for which the local station retains all of the advertising revenues 
networks also share certain of their programming with cable networks and make certain of their programming available through their web site or on web sites such as hulu 
com 
these outlets compete with us for viewers in the communities served by our stations 
the programming strength of a particular national television network may affect a local station s competitive position 
our stations  however  are diversified among the various networks  reducing the potential impact of any one network s performance 
we believe that national television network affiliations remain an efficient means of obtaining competitive programming  both for established stations with strong local news franchises and for newer stations with greater programming needs 
our stations generated an average of approximately of their total net revenue from the sale of advertising within network programming for the year ended december  our stations that are affiliated with abc  cbs and nbc generate a higher percentage of revenue from the sale of advertising within network programming than stations affiliated with fox  cw and mynetwork 
our affiliation agreements have terms with scheduled expiration dates ranging through december  these agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including a change of control of our company  which would generally result from the acquisition of of the voting rights of our company 
syndicated programming we acquire the rights to programs for time periods in which we do not air our local news or network programs 
these programs generally include reruns of current or former network programs  such as the simpsons or everybody loves raymond  or first run syndicated programs  such as oprah  judge judy or wheel of fortune 
we pay cash for these programs or exchange advertising time within the program for the cost of the program rights 
we compete with other local television stations to acquire these programs  which has caused the cost of program rights to increase over time 
in addition  a television viewer can now choose to watch many of these programs on national cable networks or purchase these programs on dvds or via downloads to computers  mobile video devices or web based video players  which has contributed to increasing fragmentation of our local television audience 
distribution of programming the programming that airs on our television stations can reach the television audience by one or more of the following distribution systems full power television stations  stations we operate under local marketing agreements  low power television stations  cable television  satellite television systems  telecommunications systems  and internet 

table of contents full power television stations we own and or operate full power television stations that operate on the digital over the air channels through as a result of the initial law that set an unconditional digital conversion date of february   a number of our stations switched to digital on february  our remaining stations will convert on or before the rescheduled date of june  for the year ended december   our full power television stations generated of our net revenue  including two full power stations for which we provided programming  sales and other related services under local marketing agreements that contributed of our net revenue during see our television stations for a listing of our full power television stations 
local marketing agreements the fcc television licenses for the two stations for which we provide programming  sales and other related services under a local marketing agreement are not owned by us 
revenues generated by these stations contributed  and to our net revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incur programming costs  operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operation of these stations  and retain all advertising revenues 
in providence and austin  the two local markets where these stations are located  we own and operate another station 
these local marketing agreement stations are an important part of our multi channel strategy 
we have a purchase option to acquire the fcc licenses in providence and austin 
low power television stations we own and operate a number of low power television stations 
we operate these stations either as stand alone stations or as satellite stations 
these low power broadcast television stations are licensed by the fcc to provide service to substantially smaller areas than those of full power stations 
these stations contributed of our total net revenue in each of the years ended december   and in five of our markets  albuquerque  austin  green bay  indianapolis and norfolk portsmouth newport news  we use our low power stations to extend the geographic reach of our primary stations in these markets 
in grand rapids we have affiliated wxsp tv  a group of low power television stations  with mynetworktv  to cover substantially all of the local market 
cable  satellite television and telecommunications systems according to nielsen  cable  satellite television and telecommunications companies currently provide program services to approximately of total us television households  with cable and telecommunications companies serving of us households and satellite providers serving 
as a result  cable  satellite television and telecommunications companies are not only our primary competitors  but the primary means by which our television audience views our television stations 
pursuant to fcc rules  broadcast stations can be carried by a distributor such as a multiple system operator mso or satellite provider in one of two ways via must carry or retransmission consent 
if a station elects to be carried on a must carry basis  the station invokes an fcc rule that requires the distributor to carry the station in the local market  on a particular channel  and on a tier of service available to all subscribers 
distributors do not pay a fee for carriage of a must carry station 
if a station elects  instead  to be carried pursuant to retransmission consent  the station waives the must carry rights and elects to be carried by the distributor under negotiated contractual terms 
these terms may include channel position  service tier carriage  and compensation 
a station elects every three years whether it will be carried pursuant to must carry or retransmission consent 
the most recent election deadline was october   for an election cycle effective january  through december  the next election will be made by october   effective january  most of our stations are distributed pursuant to retransmission consent agreements 
as of december   we had retransmission consent agreements with distributors  including msos or telecommunications companies  the two major satellite providers and two national telecommunications providers 

table of contents internet we operate more than unique web sites  serve nearly billion advertising impressions and offer a growing portfolio of internet based products and services that provide traditional and new audiences around the clock access to our trusted local news and information 
many of our web sites rank in our markets for time on site  averaging nearly minutes seasonality of our business our advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each calendar year  due generally to higher advertising in the spring season and in the period leading up to and including the end of year holiday season 
our operating results are also significantly affected by annual cycles  as advertising revenues are generally higher in even numbered years ie   due to additional revenues associated with election years from advertising spending by political candidates and incremental advertising revenues associated with olympic broadcasts 
the broadcast television industry is also cyclical in nature and affected by prevailing economic conditions 
since we rely on sales of advertising time for substantially all of our revenues  our operating results are sensitive to general economic and regional conditions in each local market where our stations operate 
digital transition of our stations on february   a measure was signed into law that set a date for conversion from analog to digital transmission of february  the transition date and included a program to subsidize the digital conversion of remaining analog receivers 
on february   a measure was signed into law to postpone the transition from analog to digital television broadcasting by four months to june  however  in accordance with that legislation  some stations may convert earlier and a number of our stations converted to digital transmission on february   the initial transition date 
the delay in the conversion for our remaining stations will cost us approximately an additional million 
as of december   we have successfully established digital transmission facilities for all of our full power stations 
we also own and operate many low power and translator stations as part of these full power stations 
the fcc allowed the broadcast industry to file applications to convert their analog low power stations and translators to digital operation 
all applications for each of our low power and translator facilities were appropriately filed with the fcc 
in some cases we were able to obtain extended coverage for our low power stations beyond the existing analog service 
one translator in new mexico was unable to obtain digital authority due to potential interference to a full power station in mexico 
we anticipate being able to resolve this issue some time after the rescheduled digital transition date of june  the cost to convert all of these low power and translator stations to digital operation was approximately million  which excludes the additional million that will be incurred to continue to operate certain of our stations in analog format due to the delay in conversion 
we expect to convert all of these low power and translator stations to digital television by the second quarter of the delay in conversion is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
competitive conditions in the television industry the television broadcast industry has become highly competitive as a result of new technologies and new program distribution systems 
local cable systems  which offer television viewers hundreds of program choices  compete for advertising dollars 
in most of our local markets  we compete directly against other local broadcast stations  cable  satellite television and telecommunication systems for audience 
we believe  however  that our local news programming  network affiliations and sales management have enabled us to compete effectively in our markets

broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc under the communications act of  as amended the communications act 
the communications act requires the fcc to regulate broadcasting so as to serve the public interest  convenience and necessity 
the communications act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except pursuant to licenses issued by the fcc and empowers the fcc  among other things  to issue  renew  revoke and modify broadcasting licenses  assign frequency bands  determine stations frequencies  locations and power  and regulate the equipment used by stations 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of a license or the transfer of control of a license without the fcc s prior approval 
the fcc also regulates certain aspects of the operation of cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite dbs systems and other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations 
in addition  the fcc regulates matters such as television station ownership  network affiliate relations  cable and dbs systems carriage of television station signals  carriage of syndicated and network programming on distant stations  political advertising practices and obscene and indecent programming 
license renewals 
under the communications act  the fcc generally may grant and renew broadcast licenses for terms of eight years  though licenses may be renewed for a shorter period under certain circumstances 
the communications act requires the fcc to renew a broadcast license if the fcc finds that i the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  ii there have been no serious violations of either the communications act or the fcc s rules and regulations by the licensee  and iii there have been no other serious violations that taken together constitute a pattern of abuse 
in making its determination  the fcc may consider petitions to deny but cannot consider whether the public interest would be better served by issuing the license to a person other than the renewal applicant 
we are in good standing with respect to each of our fcc licenses 
our licenses have expiration dates ranging between and the table on page includes the expiration date of each of our licenses 
we have timely filed license renewal applications for each of our stations 
once an application for renewal is filed  each station remains licensed while its application is pending  even after its license expiration date has passed 
certain of our licenses have pending applications for renewal that we expect to be reviewed in we expect to renew each of these licenses but we make no assurance that we will be able to do so 
ownership regulation 
the communications act and fcc rules limit the ability of individuals and entities to have ownership or other attributable interests in certain combinations of broadcast stations and other media 
in june  the fcc launched a rulemaking proceeding to promulgate new media ownership rules 
this rulemaking was  in part  a response to a decision of the third circuit court of appeals that stayed and remanded several of the ownership rule changes that the fcc had adopted in the rules adopted in would have liberalized most of the ownership rules which would have permitted us to acquire television stations in certain markets where we are currently prohibited from acquiring newspaper broadcast cross ownership 
the fcc made no other changes to its broadcast ownership rules  thereby leaving in place the majority of the pre june broadcast ownership rules 
the fcc s currently effective ownership rules that are material to our operations are summarized below 
table of contents local television ownership 
under the fcc s current local television ownership or duopoly rule  a party may own multiple television stations without regard to signal contour overlap provided they are located in separate nielsen dmas 
in addition  the rules permit parties to own up to two tv stations in the same dma so long as i at least one of the two stations is not among the top four ranked stations in the market based on audience share at the time an application for approval of the acquisition is filed with the fcc  and ii at least eight independently owned and operating full power commercial and non commercial television stations would remain in the market after the acquisition 
in addition  without regard to the number of remaining or independently owned television stations  the fcc will permit television duopolies within the same dma so long as the grade b signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap 
stations designated by the fcc as satellite stations  which are full power stations that typically rebroadcast the programming of a parent station  are exempt from the local television ownership rule 
also  the fcc may grant a waiver of the local television ownership rule if one of the two television stations is a failed or failing station or if the proposed transaction would result in the construction of a new television station an unbuilt station waiver 
we are currently in compliance with the local television ownership rule 
one of our stations in new haven applied for and was granted an unbuilt station waiver 
a subsequent transfer of the duopoly in new haven may require a waiver if no additional independent stations initiate operations in the market 
eligibility for a waiver will depend upon the station s future performance 
local marketing agreements are considered equivalent to ownership for purposes of the local ownership rules and thus  subject to certain exceptions  are permissible only where ownership is permissible 
the fcc has grandfathered otherwise ineligible television local marketing agreements entered into prior to november  grandfathered local marketing agreements can be freely transferred during the grandfather period  but duopolies may be transferred only where the two station combination continues to qualify under the duopoly rule 
in the event that the fcc determines that the grandfathered local marketing agreement that we have in providence is ineligible for conversion to full ownership  we have the right to assign our purchase option to a third party and we believe we can arrange a suitable disposition  including alternative non attributable operating arrangements with such a party  such as a more limited programming and services agreement or joint sales agreement  if necessary  which will not be materially less favorable to us than the current local marketing agreement 
however  the rules may not be implemented or interpreted in such a manner 
in austin  we assigned our purchase option for knva tv  for which we also have a grandfathered local marketing agreement  to a third party  vaughan media  llc  that subsequently exercised the option to acquire the outstanding shares of the entity that holds the fcc licensee for that station 
the assignment and subsequent exercise of the option by vaughan media  llc are the subject of litigation between us  vaughan media  llc and the licensee 
for more information see item legal proceedings 
national television ownership cap 
the communications act  as amended in  limits the number of television stations one entity may own nationally 
under the rule  no entity may have an attributable interest in television stations that reach  in the aggregate  more than of all us television households 
the fcc currently discounts the audience reach of a uhf station by when computing the national television ownership cap 
the percentage of all us households that our stations reach is approximately 
media cross ownership 
the fcc revised its newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule in december  however  the revised rule is not yet effective 
the fcc historically has prohibited the licensee of a radio or tv station from directly or indirectly owning  operating  or controlling a daily newspaper if the station s specified service contour encompasses the entire community where the newspaper is published 
under the revised rule  newspaper broadcast cross ownership would nonetheless be permissible if i the market at issue is one of the largest dmas  ii the transaction involves the combination of only one major daily newspaper and only one television or radio station  iii where the transaction involves a television station  at least eight independently owned and operating major media voices major newspapers and full power television stations would remain in the dma following the transaction  and iv where the transaction involves a television station  that station is not among the top four ranked stations in the dma 
for all other proposed newspaper broadcast transactions  the fcc s historic prohibition generally would remain in place 
the cross ownership rules also permit cross ownership of radio and television stations under a graduated test based on the number of independently owned media voices in the local market 
in large markets markets with at least independently owned media voices  a single entity can own up to one television station and seven radio stations or  if permissible under the local television ownership rule if eight full power television stations would remain in the market post transaction  two television stations and six radio stations 

table of contents attribution of ownership 
under the fcc s attribution policies  the following relationships and interests generally are attributable for purposes of the fcc s broadcast ownership restrictions holders of or more of the licensee s voting stock  unless the holder is a qualified passive investor  in which case the threshold is a or greater voting stock interest  all officers and directors of a licensee and its direct or indirect parent s  any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company  unless properly insulated from management activities  and equity and or debt interests which in the aggregate exceed of a licensee s total assets  if the interest holder supplies more than of the station s total weekly programming  or is a same market broadcast company  cable operator or newspaper the equity debt plus standard 
under the single majority shareholder exception to the fcc s attribution policies  otherwise attributable interests under are not attributable if a corporate licensee is controlled by a single majority shareholder and the minority interest holder is not otherwise attributable under the equity debt plus standard 
thus  in our case  where we have a single majority shareholder  ownership of minority stock interests of up to are not attributable absent other factors 
because of these multiple and cross ownership rules  any person or entity that acquires an attributable interest in us may violate the fcc s rules if that purchaser also has an attributable interest in other television or radio stations  or in daily newspapers  depending on the number and location of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers 
such person or entity also may be restricted in the companies in which it may invest to the extent that those investments give rise to an attributable interest 
if the holder of an attributable interest violates any of these ownership rules or if a proposed acquisition by us would cause such a violation  we may be unable to obtain from the fcc one or more authorizations needed to conduct our television station business and may be unable to obtain the fcc s consents for certain future acquisitions 
digital television transition 
all us television stations are required to terminate all analog broadcasts by june  and may elect  with fcc approval  to terminate their analog signal sooner 
broadcasters must pay certain fees for non broadcast uses of their digital channels 
in addition  the fcc determined that broadcasters who transmit multiple programs on their digital channels are required to carry additional children s educational programming and is evaluating whether to impose further public interest programming requirements on digital broadcasters 
the fcc s current implementation plan would maintain the secondary status of low power television stations with respect to dtv operations and many low power television stations  particularly in major markets  could be displaced  including some of ours 
cable and satellite carriage of local television signals 
federal law requires television broadcasters to make an election to exercise either must carry or retransmission consent rights in connection with their carriage by cable systems or satellite television providers 
if a broadcaster chooses to exercise its must carry rights  it may demand carriage on a specified channel on cable and satellite systems within its local market 
must carry rights are not absolute 
distributors may decline carriage for a variety of reasons  including a lack of channel capacity for smaller systems  the inability of the station asserting must carry rights to deliver a good quality signal to the cable system or satellite provider or the presence of a more proximate duplicate affiliate of the same network 
stations asserting must carry rights are not permitted to receive additional compensation from the distributor carrying their stations 
if a station owner chooses to exercise its retransmission consent rights  it may prohibit distributors from carrying its signal  or permit carriage under a negotiated compensation arrangement 

table of contents must carry rights are limited to carriage within a station s local market and preclude a station from receiving anything other than limited carriage rights in exchange for the use of its programming 
must carry is generally elected in instances where the broadcast station believes it is unlikely to obtain either cost free carriage or additional compensation through negotiation 
this is more likely to be the case with respect to stations which have disadvantaged signals or channel positions  or which are without strong networks  or local news operations and to systems in areas dominated by a single cable operator  or where there are overlapping signals from stations in adjacent markets 
otherwise  stations generally elect to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with distributors 
a retransmission consent agreement is generally elected where a station seeks not just carriage but compensation from the distributor 
retransmission consent agreements are also required for carriage on systems outside of a station s local market 
compensation may include cash or other forms of payment  enhanced channel position  or carriage of and payment for additional program services such as a local weather service or a second national network carried on a low power station in the same market 
we currently have retransmission consent agreements with virtually all distributors cable  telecommunications and satellite in our local markets 
there are currently two satellite video service providers covering the us market directv and dish network 
these satellite video service systems deliver subscription programming similar to that of cable systems to consumers who have purchased and installed a small satellite dish and receiver 
in addition to providing the national cable channels ie espn  msnbc  discovery channel  etc  satellite video service providers carry most of the local broadcast signals in the markets they serve 
the satellite compulsory license permits satellite video service systems to provide local signals into only their local markets  which is called the local in local provision  and prohibits the importation of distant stations into a local market 
as with cable carriage  broadcasters have been given the right to negotiate retransmission consent for their local signals in exchange for compensation or to demand carriage as a matter of right for no compensation 
both directv and dish network have now initiated carriage of local stations in most of our markets and we have retransmission consent agreements with both companies for the carriage of our signals that have scheduled expiration dates ranging through february  regulatory issues involving programming and station operations 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
since the early s  the fcc gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station s local market 
broadcast station licensees continue  however  to be required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
stations must follow various rules promulgated under the communications act that regulate  among other things  children s television programming and advertising  political advertising  sponsorship identifications  contest and lottery advertising and program ratings guidelines 
the commission proposed to re establish a number of formalized procedures designed to improve television broadcasters service to their local communities 
these proposals include the establishment of community advisory boards  quantitative programming guidelines and maintenance of a main studio in a station s community of license 
the fcc is also considering additional regulations governing product placement and closed captioning 
we are unable to predict which  if any  of these proposals the fcc will ultimately adopt and whether such final rules will have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide competitive programming 
the fcc is also charged with enforcing restrictions or prohibitions on the broadcast of obscene and indecent programs and in recent years has increased its enforcement activities in this area  issuing large fines against radio and television stations found to have carried such programming 
in june  legislation was signed into law and  in june  adopted by the fcc that increases the maximum monetary penalty for carriage of indecent programming tenfold to  per station per violation with a cap of million for any single act  and put the licenses of repeat offenders in jeopardy 
the fcc adopted the increased forfeiture amount in june of court challenges to the fcc s indecency enforcement regime are pending at various stages 
we are unable to predict whether the enforcement of the indecency regulations will have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide competitive programming 
recent regulatory developments  proposed legislation and regulation 
congress and the fcc currently have under consideration  and may in the future adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect  directly or indirectly  the operation and ownership of our stations 
the foregoing discussion summarizes the federal statutes and regulations material to our operations  but does not purport to be a complete summary of all the provisions of the communications act or of other current or proposed statutes  regulations  and policies affecting our business 
the summaries should be read in conjunction with the text of the statutes  rules  regulations  orders  and decisions described herein 
we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of any of the pending fcc rule making proceedings referenced above  the outcome of any reconsideration or appellate proceedings concerning any changes in fcc rules or policies noted above  the possible outcome of any proposed or pending congressional legislation  or the impact of any of those changes on our stations

item a 
risk factors risks associated with our business activities the economic downturn will likely cause further reductions in our advertising revenues  and the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may negatively impact our business and as a result we may not have sufficient funds to operate our business 
our operations and performance are materially affected by economic conditions  which have deteriorated significantly and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
the economic slowdown has adversely affected local and national advertising revenues across all of our stations  and this is likely to continue in the recent market turmoil and tightening of credit has also generally reduced consumer confidence  increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  increased pricing pressure on products and services  and has led to widespread reduction of global business activity 
uncertainty about recent economic conditions has resulted in decreased consumer spending and a significant decline in sales in several industries  including the automotive industry  from which we received approximately  and of our advertising revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect continued decreased demand in other advertising categories  in addition to automotive  in these developments are likely to result in decreased revenues and weaker results of operations for us and  if they persist  and if we are unable to offset the decreased revenues by additional cost savings  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 
a material reduction in cash flows and weakened financial condition could impair our ability to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments  as more fully described below 

table of contents additionally  we have a history of net losses and a substantial accumulated deficit 
we had net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily as a result of impairment of our broadcast licenses and goodwill  and interest expense 
in addition  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of billion 
these losses may or may not recur  and our net losses and accumulated deficit may therefore continue indefinitely 
as a result  we may not have sufficient funds to operate our business 
the general electric capital corporation gecc note could result in significant liabilities  including i requiring us to make short term cash payments to the nbc universal joint venture to fund interest payments  and ii triggering a change of control under our existing indebtedness  which would cause such existing indebtedness to become immediately due and payable 
gecc provided debt financing for a joint venture between nbc universal and us  in the form of an million non amortizing senior secured note due bearing interest at an initial rate of per annum until march  and per annum thereafter the gecc note 
the gecc note is an obligation of the joint venture 
we have a equity interest in the joint venture and nbc universal has the remaining equity interest  in which we and nbc unverisal each have a voting interest 
nbc universal operates the two television stations  kxas tv  an nbc affiliate in dallas  and knsd tv  an nbc affiliate in san diego  pursuant to a management agreement 
nbc universal and gecc are both majority owned subsidiaries of general electric company 
lin tv has guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on the gecc note 
we may be required to make cash payments to the joint venture to fund interest payments on the gecc note 
current general economic pressures have negatively affected the operating results of the television stations in the joint venture  resulting in a decline in cash flows 
although the joint venture distributed cash to nbc universal and us in the amount of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  the cash distributions for included nonrecurring cash proceeds of million from the sale of broadcast towers 
the joint venture s cash balances as of december  were million 
nbc universal and we have agreed that the joint venture will not distribute any cash to either nbc universal or us in  and will use a portion of its existing cash balances to fund interest payments on the gecc note in we have agreed to waive the requirement of the joint venture to maintain cash balances of at least million 
additionally  nbc has agreed to defer payment of its and management fees 
if the current decline in advertising expenditures continues  we believe the joint venture may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or from available cash balances to cover all of the interest payments due on the gecc note in the annual interest expense on the gecc note is million 
we estimate that the cash available to the joint venture will be in the range of million to million less than the amount needed to pay interest on the gecc note during the fourth quarter of the actual cash shortfall could be greater than our current estimate 
nbc universal and we have agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to cover interest payments on the gecc note  we and nbc universal will provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
if we are required to fund a portion of a shortfall loan  we plan to use our available cash balances or available borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  if the joint venture experiences further cash shortfalls beyond  we may decide to fund such cash shortfalls  or to cover such shortfalls through further loans or equity contributions to the joint venture 
lin tv s guarantee of the gecc note could cause other material adverse effects 
the gecc note is not an obligation of lin tv or lin television or any of its subsidiaries 
gecc s only recourse  upon an event of default under the gecc note  is to the joint venture  our equity interest in the joint venture and  after exhausting all remedies against the assets of the joint venture and the other equity interests in the joint venture  to lin tv pursuant to its guarantee of the gecc note 
an event of default under the gecc note will occur if the joint venture fails to make any scheduled interest payment within days of the date due and payable  or to pay the principal amount on the maturity date 
if the joint venture fails to pay interest on the gecc note  and neither nbc universal nor we make a shortfall loan to cover the interest payment within days of the date due and payable  an event of default would occur and gecc could accelerate the maturity of the entire amount due under the gecc note 
other than the acceleration of the principal amount upon an event of default  prepayment of the principal of the note is prohibited unless agreed upon by both nbc universal and us 
under the terms of its guarantee of the gecc note  lin tv would be required to make a payment for an amount to be determined the guarantee amount upon occurrence of the following events a there is an event of default  b neither nbc universal or us remedy the default  and c after gecc exhausts all remedies against the assets of the joint venture  the total amount realized upon exercise of those remedies is less than the million principal amount of the gecc note 
upon the occurrence of such events  the amount owed by lin tv to gecc pursuant to the guarantee would be calculated as the difference between i the total amount at which the joint venture s assets were sold and ii the principal amount and any unpaid interest due under the gecc note 
as of december   we estimated that the fair value of the television stations in the joint venture to be approximately million less than the outstanding balance of the gecc note of million 

table of contents we believe that it is remote that there would be an event of default and therefore an acceleration of the principal amount of the gecc note during  although there can be no assurances that such an event of default will not occur 
there are no financial or similar covenants in the gecc note and  since both nbc universal and we have agreed to fund the interest payments if the joint venture is unable to do so  nbc universal and we are able to control the occurrence of a default under the gecc note 
however  if an event of default under the gecc note occurs  lin tv  which conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries  could experience material adverse consequences  including gecc  after exhausting all remedies against the joint venture  could enforce its rights under the guarantee  which could cause lin tv to determine that lin television should seek to sell material assets owned by it in order to satisfy lin tv s obligations under the guarantee  gecc s initiation of proceedings against lin tv under the guarantee  could result in material adverse consequences to lin television  which would cause an acceleration of lin television s credit facility and other outstanding indebtedness  and if the gecc note is prepaid because of an acceleration on default or otherwise  we would incur a substantial tax liability of approximately million related to our deferred gain associated with the formation of the joint venture 
our operating results are primarily dependent on advertising revenues  which can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control  and which makes us vulnerable to economic downturns 
advertising volatility based on general and local economic conditions  and program ratings  affects our operating results and may make it difficult for us to repay our debt obligations  or cause the value of our common stock to decline 
advertising revenue  including local  national and political advertising revenues  consisted of approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and local advertising revenues decreased for the year ended december  and increased for the year ended december   compared to their respective prior periods 
national advertising revenues decreased and for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to their respective prior periods 
our ability to generate advertising revenues depends on factors such as national and local economic conditions  the relative popularity of the programming on our stations  the demographic characteristics of our markets  and the activities of our competitors 
our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership or we may not achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenues to decline 
we  and those on whom we rely for programming  may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in viewer tastes and interests of our local markets 
in addition  political advertising revenue from elections and advertising revenues from olympic games  which generally occur in the even years  create large fluctuations in our operating results on a year to year basis 
for example  during  we had political advertising revenues of million  compared to million in the prior year  as discussed in item business under seasonality of our business 

table of contents we depend to a significant degree on automotive advertising 
approximately  and of our net revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted of automotive advertising 
a significant decrease in these revenues in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows  which could affect our ability to fund operations and service our debt obligations and affect the value of our common stock 
automotive advertising continues to be adversely affected by the continued difficulties experienced by the automotive industry 
we have a substantial amount of debt  which could adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  reduce our operating flexibility and put us at greater risk for default and acceleration of our debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness and a deficit of million of consolidated stockholders equity 
our outstanding debt under our credit facility is due november  and both of our senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes class b are due may  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we have also guaranteed an million note in connection with our joint venture with nbc universal  as further described below 
accordingly  we will continue to have significant debt service obligations 
our large amount of indebtedness could  for example require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on indebtedness and reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate activities  require us to dispose of television stations or other assets at times or on terms that may be less advantageous than those we might otherwise be able to obtain  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  expose us to greater interest rate risk  because the interest rates on our credit facility vary  and impair our ability to successfully withstand a sustained downturn in our business or the economy in general and place us at a disadvantage relative to our less leveraged competitors 
our indentures also have change of control provisions which may require us to purchase all or a portion of our senior subordinated notes and our senior subordinated notes class b at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity and results of operations 
we could fail to comply with one of our financial covenants  which would adversely affect our financial condition 
our debt instruments require us to comply with financial covenants  including  among others  leverage ratios and interest coverage tests 
these covenants restrict the manner in which we conduct our business and may impact our operating results 
further  weak results of operations due to reduced advertising revenues may make it harder for us to comply with such covenants 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of our indebtedness under our debt agreements or under other instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
in the past  we have obtained amendments with respect to compliance with financial ratio tests in our credit facility 
consents or amendments that may be required in the future may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  especially in the current economic environment 
additionally  our debt instruments also contain certain other covenants that restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations and make capital expenditures 

table of contents we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations  forcing us to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  will be subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
cash interest paid during the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
our required payments of principal were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we made no payments of principal during the year ended december  our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to pay our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow  or refinance our indebtedness  or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms  we may have to seek to restructure our remaining debt obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the market  if any  for our debt 
the economic downturn and deterioration of the credit markets may also impact our ability to refinance our debt or to refinance our debt on terms similar to our existing debt agreements 
our class a common stock may not continue to trade on the nyse  which could reduce the value of an investment in us and make it more difficult to sell our shares 
for our class a common stock to trade on the nyse  we must continue to meet the listing standards of that exchange 
among other things  those standards require that our class a common stock maintain an average closing price of at least and our average global market capitalization must equal or exceed million over a consecutive trading day period 
our common stock has traded at prices near and below since november on february   the nyse announced that it was temporarily suspending the minimum share price requirement until june  nevertheless  as a result of our reduced stock price  our average global market capitalization declined below million during december on january   we received written notice from nyse regulation  inc that we are not in compliance with the average global market capitalization listing standard 
as permitted by section of the nyse listed company manual  within days from its receipt of the nyse s written notice  we submitted a plan advising the nyse of the actions we intend to take to bring us into compliance with the nyse s market capitalization standard within months of the receipt of notice 
under the nyse s listing standards  the nyse has days to evaluate the plan 
if the nyse does not accept the plan  or if we are not able to perform under the plan  the nyse may commence suspension and delisting procedures 
delisting of our common stock from the nyse could hinder the ability to sell  or obtain an accurate quotation for the price of shares of our common stock 
delisting could also adversely affect the perception among investors of lin tv and its prospects  which could lead to further declines in the market price of our common stock 
delisting would also make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise capital 
we may have significant increases in our cash funding requirements of our pension plan  which would reduce our cash flow from operations 
the volatility of the equity markets resulted in the fair value of our pension plan assets declining to million as of december  from million as of december  we contributed million  million and million to our pension plan for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate contributing approximately million to our pension plan in although we currently have no minimum funding requirements as defined by erisa and federal tax laws 
the continuing economic downturn and the disruptions in the financial markets could significantly increase the cash funding requirements of our pension plan and our pension expense in and thereafter 

table of contents we have a material amount of intangible assets and we have recorded substantial impairments of these assets 
future write downs of intangible assets would reduce net income or increase net loss  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our class a common stock 
future impairment charges could significantly adversely impact our reported results of operations and stockholders equity 
approximately million or of our total assets as of december  consist of indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
financial accounting standard fas  goodwill and other intangible assets fas  requires  among other things  that goodwill and certain other intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or the intangible asset over its fair value 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant 
we recorded an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  and we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these impairments were primarily a result of the economic downturn during and the decline of our class a common stock during both years  and  during the departure of our former ceo 
for further details see note intangible assets 
if we determine in a future period as part of our testing for impairments of intangible assets and goodwill  that the carrying amount of our intangible assets exceeds the fair value of these assets  we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our class a common stock 
our strategy has historically included growth through acquisitions  which could pose various risks and increase our leverage 
we have pursued and intend to selectively continue to pursue strategic acquisitions  subject to market conditions and the liquidity of our company  with the goal of improving our business by applying our management s business and growth strategy 
we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets nor have the financial capacity to complete additional acquisitions 
acquisitions involve inherent risks  such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition 
we may not be able to successfully implement effective cost controls or increase revenues with respect to any acquisition 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management s attention from the operation of our core business 
in addition  acquisitions  such as television stations  are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest some television stations if the fcc believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
hmc and its affiliates  whose interests may differ from your interests  have approval rights with respect to significant transactions and could convert their equity interests in our company into a majority of voting power  thereby reducing the voting power of our other shareholders 
hmc and its affiliates own one share of our class c common stock  which represents of our outstanding voting power  and also have the ability to convert shares of our non voting class b common stock into class a common stock  subject to fcc approval 
upon the conversion of the majority of the non voting class b common stock into class a common stock  the class c common stock will automatically convert into an equal number of shares of class a common stock 
if this occurs  affiliates of hmc would own approximately of our voting equity interests and will effectively have the ability to elect the entire board of directors and to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of hmc and its affiliates may differ from the interests of our other stockholders and hmc and its affiliates could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our other stockholders 
for example  hmc is in the business of making significant investments in existing or newly formed companies and may from time to time acquire and hold controlling or non controlling interests in television broadcast assets that may directly or indirectly compete with our company for advertising revenues 
in addition  hmc and its affiliates may from time to time identify  pursue and consummate acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 

table of contents moreover  royal w 
carson  iii  a director  and hmc  combined beneficially own all of our class c common stock and therefore possess of the combined voting power 
accordingly  mr 
carson and hmc together have the power to elect our entire board of directors and  through this control  to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
mr

mr 
carson is the president of carson private capital incorporated  an investment firm that sponsors funds of funds and dedicated funds that have invested substantially all of the net capital of these funds in private equity investment funds sponsored by firms like hmc or its affiliates 
mr 
carson also serves on an advisory board representing the interests of limited partners of hicks  muse  tate furst equity fund v  lp  sector performance fund  lp  and hicks  muse  tate furst europe fund lp  which are sponsored by hmc 
the three listed funds do not have an investment in us 
in addition  peter s 
brodsky  one of our directors  is a partner of hmc 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue could decline 
the entertainment industry  and particularly the television industry  is highly competitive and is undergoing a period of consolidation and significant change 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment alternatives  such as cable  satellite television and telecommunications video services  internet  wireless  pay per view and video on demand  digital video recorders  dvds and mobile video devices have fragmented television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to new types of competition 
as a result  we are experiencing increased competition for viewing audience and advertisers 
new technologies may affect our broadcasting operations 
the television broadcasting business is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and the emergence of new technologies 
we cannot predict the effect such technologies will have on our broadcast operations 
in addition  the capital expenditures necessary to implement these new technologies could be substantial and other companies employing such technologies before we are able to could aggressively compete with our business 
it would be difficult to take us over  which could adversely affect the trading price of our class a common stock 
affiliates of hmc effectively have the ability to determine whether a change of control will occur through their ownership of one of the two outstanding shares of our class c common stock and all of the shares of our class b common stock 
provisions of delaware corporate law and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation  including the voting power rights of our class c common stock held by mr 
carson and hmc and the voting power that affiliates of hmc would hold upon conversion of their shares of class b stock into class a stock or class c stock  make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would benefit the holders of our class a common stock 
these provisions and controlling ownership by affiliates of hmc could also adversely affect the public trading price of our class a common stock 
the loss of network affiliation agreements or changes in network affiliations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to quickly replace the network affiliation 
the non renewal or termination of a network affiliation agreement or a change in network affiliations could have a material adverse effect on us 
each of the networks generally provides our affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  our stations broadcast network inserted commercials during that programming and  in some cases  receive cash payments from networks  and in other cases  we make cash payments to certain networks 
in addition  some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances  including as a result of a change of control of our company  which would generally result upon the acquisition of of our voting power 
in the event that affiliates of hmc elect to convert our class b common stock shares held by them into shares of either class a common stock or class c common stock  such conversion may result in a change of control of our company causing an early termination of some or all of our network affiliation agreements 
some of the networks with which our stations are affiliated have required us  upon renewal of affiliation agreements  to reduce or eliminate network compensation and  in specific cases  to make cash payments to the network  and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements 
consequently  our affiliation agreements may not all remain in place and each network may not continue to provide programming or compensation to us on the same basis as it currently provides programming or compensation to our stations 
if any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with networks for any reason  we would need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive and more expensive 

table of contents a change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short term and long term consequences  depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change 
potential short term consequences include a increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs  which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station s viewing audience  b short term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch  c costs of building a new or larger news operation  d other increases in station programming costs  if necessary  and e the cost of equipment needed to conform the station s programming  equipment and logos to the new network affiliation 
long term consequences are more difficult to assess  due to the cyclical nature of each of the major network s share of the audience that changes from year to year with programs coming to the end of their production cycle  and the audience acceptance of new programs in the future and the fact that national network audience ratings are not necessarily indicative of how a network s programming is accepted in an individual market 
how well a particular network fares in an affiliation switch depends largely on the value of the broadcast license  which is influenced by the length of time the television station has been broadcasting  the quality and location of the license  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station and the quality of the station non network programming 
in addition  the majority of the revenue earned by television stations is attributable to locally produced news and syndicated programming  rather than to network affiliation payments and advertising sales related to network programming 
the circumstances that may surround a network affiliation switch cause uncertainty as to the actual costs that will be incurred by us and  if these costs are significant  the switch could have a material adverse impact on the income we derive from the affected station 
the use of an alternative method of valuing our network affiliations could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 
some broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of different valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets among broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market  the length of time that the broadcast license has been broadcasting  the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within the market  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station  and the quality of non network programming carried by a station 
we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we have used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all of our markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all of the markets in which we operate  beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more or less favorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
some broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
if we were to adopt this alternative method for valuing network affiliations  the value of our broadcast licenses as reported on our balance sheet would be reduced and the value of network affiliations would be proportionately increased 
as a result  our expenses relating to the amortization of intangible assets could increase significantly as more value would be assigned to an amortizing asset and this increase could materially reduce our operating income and net income 

table of contents in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different factors and circumstances for each station and market being evaluated 
risks related to our industry our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs  and increased programming costs could adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is subject to significant syndicated and other programming costs 
we often acquire program rights two or three years in advance  making it difficult for us to accurately predict how a program will perform 
in some instances  we may have to replace programs before their costs have been fully amortized  resulting in impairments and write offs that increase station operating costs 
we may be exposed to future programming cost increases  which may adversely affect our operating results 
changes in fcc ownership rules through fcc action  judicial review or federal legislation may limit our ability to continue providing services to stations under local marketing agreements  may prevent us from obtaining ownership of the stations we currently provide services to under local marketing agreements and or may preclude us from obtaining the full economic value of one or more of our duopoly  or two station operations upon a sale  merger or other similar transaction transferring ownership of such station or stations 
fcc ownership rules currently impose significant limitations on the ability of broadcast licensees to have attributable interests in multiple media properties 
in addition  federal law prohibits one company from owning broadcast television stations that collectively have service areas encompassing more than an aggregate share of national television households 
ownership restrictions under fcc rules also include a variety of local limits on media ownership 
the restrictions include an ownership limit of one television station in most medium and smaller television markets and two stations in most larger markets  known as the television duopoly rule 
the regulations also include a prohibition on the common ownership of a newspaper and television station in the same market newspaper television cross ownership  limits on common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market radio television station ownership and limits on radio ownership of four to eight radio stations in a local market 
should the fcc liberalize media ownership rules  attractive opportunities may arise for additional television station and other media acquisitions 
but these changes also create additional competition for us from other entities  such as national broadcast networks  large station groups  newspaper chains and cable operators who may be better positioned to take advantage of such changes and benefit from the resulting operating synergies both nationally and in specific markets 
should the television duopoly rule become relaxed  we may be able to acquire the ownership of one or both of the stations in austin and providence for which we currently provide programming  sales and other related services under local marketing agreements and for which we have purchase option agreements to purchase these stations 
should we be unable to do so  there is no assurance that the grandfathering of our local marketing agreements will be permitted beyond conclusion of the current further rule making 
we had net revenues of million  or  of our total net revenues  attributable to local marketing agreements for the year ended december  any potential hostilities or terrorist attacks may affect our revenues and results of operations 
if the us becomes engaged in new  large scale foreign hostilities or if there is a terrorist attack against the us  we may lose advertising revenue and incur increased broadcasting expenses due to pre emption  delay or cancellation of advertising campaigns and increased costs of providing news coverage of such events 
we cannot predict the extent and duration of any future disruption to our programming schedule  the amount of advertising revenue that would be lost or delayed or the amount by which our expenses would increase as a result 
consequently  any related future loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations

item properties we maintain our corporate headquarters in providence under an operating lease that expires on december  each of our stations has facilities consisting of offices  studios  sales offices and tower and transmitter sites 
tower and transmitter sites are located in areas that provide optimal coverage to each of our markets 
we own substantially all of the offices and studios where our stations are located and generally own the property where our towers and primary transmitters are located 
we lease the remaining properties  consisting primarily of sales office locations and microwave transmitter sites 
while none of the station properties owned or leased by us are individually material to our operations  if we were required to relocate any of our towers  the cost could be significant 
this is because the number of sites in any geographic area that permit a tower of reasonable height to provide good coverage of the market is limited  and zoning and other land use restrictions  as well as federal aviation administration and fcc regulations  limit the number of alternative locations or increase the cost of acquiring them for tower sites 
item legal proceedings we are involved in various claims and lawsuits that are generally incidental to our business

our operating revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  national and political advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from digital revenues  network compensation  barter and other revenues 
the economic downturn has adversely affected local and national advertising across all of our stations  which has impacted our overall results of operations for we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and net loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the substantial loss in was primarily due to aggregate impairment charges we recorded of approximately billion during the year ended december  for our broadcast licenses  goodwill and broadcast equipment  principally due to the following a the decline in advertising revenues  b the decline in operating profits of our stations  including the stations in our joint venture with nbc universal  and c higher discount rates due to the current economic environment and credit crisis 
additionally  the impairment charge includes million for the write off of certain broadcast assets that have become obsolete as a result of the dtv transition

critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements certain of our accounting policies  as well as estimates we make  are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations since they are particularly sensitive to our judgment 
some of these policies and estimates relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the estimates and judgments we make affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  program rights  income taxes  stock based compensation  pensions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and it is possible that such differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates discussed below are particularly critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have discussed each of these critical accounting policies and related estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets approximately million  or  of our total assets as of december  consisted of indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
as required by fas  we test the impairment of our broadcast licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of broadcast licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario 

table of contents also as required by fas  we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a station with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a station is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the station and prevailing values in the markets for broadcasting properties 
if the fair value of the station exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the station exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the station s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess but not more than the carrying value of goodwill 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the second quarter of that included an impairment to the carrying values of our broadcast licenses of million  relating to of our television stations  and an impairment to the carrying values of our goodwill of million  relating to of our television stations 
as required by fas  we tested for impairment our indefinite lived intangible assets at june   between the required annual tests  because we believed events had occurred and circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill below their carrying amounts 
these events included a the continued decline of the price of our class a common stock  b the decline in the current selling prices of television stations  c the lower growth in advertising revenues  and d the decline in the operating profit margins of some of our stations 
we used the same assumptions as disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   except for the adjustments that are detailed in the table below 
the increase in the discount rate reflected the volatility of stock prices of public companies within the media sector 
the changes in the market growth rates and operating profit margins reflected the general economic pressures impacting both the national and a number of local economies  and specifically  national and local advertising expenditures in the markets where our stations operate 
as required by fas  we also performed our annual test for impairment of broadcast licenses and goodwill as of december   and as a result of these annual tests we recorded an additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of of million  excluding an million charge for the write off of certain broadcast assets  that have become obsolete as a result of the dtv transition  includes a goodwill impairment charge of million and an impairment charge of million related to our broadcast licenses 
this was due to the continued economic recession that started in december  the decline in advertising revenues and the more recent financial credit crisis 
the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our own internal business plans as well as future expectations about general economic and local market conditions 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the second quarter of that included a broadcast license impairment charge of million relating to of our television stations and a goodwill impairment charge of million 
as required by fas  we tested our indefinite lived intangible assets as of june   which was between annual tests  because we believed that  based upon the continued decline in the trading price of our class a common stock  it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units would fall below their carrying amounts 
we used market information not available as of december  to calculate the fair value of our broadcast licenses and reporting units 
the impairment tests as of june  used the same assumptions as disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   with the exception of the discount rate  the market growth rate and the operating profit margins  as detailed in the table below 
there were no events during to warrant the performance of an interim impairment test of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
additionally  there were no additional impairment charges recorded as of december  and 
table of contents we based the valuation of broadcast licenses on the following average industry based assumptions december  june  december  december  june  market revenue growth operating profit margins discount rate tax rate capitalization rate regarding potential changes to these assumptions and the potential impact on the december  carrying values of our broadcast licenses  if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by and by  we would incur an additional impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the operating profit margins by and from the projected operating profit margins  we would incur an additional impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively 
if we were to increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by and  we would incur an additional impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively 
we based the valuation of goodwill on the following assumptions based on our internal projections december  june  december  december  june  market revenue growth operating profit margins discount rate tax rate capitalization rate regarding potential changes to these assumptions and the potential impact on the december  carrying value of our goodwill  if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by and by of the projected growth rate  the enterprise value of our reporting units would not change 
if we were to decrease the operating profit margins by and from the projected operating profit margins  the enterprise value of our reporting units would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by and  the enterprise value of our reporting units would decrease by million and million  respectively 
in addition  we would then be required to take these enterprise values to the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill million at december  
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by a notional reperformance of the purchase price allocation using the station s fair value as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 

table of contents network affiliations other broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets by these broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market  the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting 
television stations that have been broadcasting since the late s  are viewed more often than newer television stations  the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within a market ie the value of being licensed in the smallest city within a tri city market has less value than being licensed in the largest city  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station 
the local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its network programming  and the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndicated programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 

table of contents a local television station can be the top rated station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on the factors or attributes listed above 
abc  cbs  fox and nbc  each have affiliations with local television stations that have the largest primetime audience in the local market in which the station operates regardless of the network s primetime rating 
some broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all our markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to our television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all our markets in which we operate beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different facts and circumstances for each station and market being evaluated 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such a determination was made 
revenue recognition we recognize advertising and other program related revenue during the period in which advertising or programs are aired on our television stations or carried by our internet web sites 
we recognize retransmission consent fees in the period in which these services are performed 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of fas r  share based payment fas r 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables to be assumed in the calculation  including the option s expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns

the following table presents summarized information for the puerto rico operations and banks broadcasting that were previously included in historical operating results in thousands year ended december  puerto rico banks broadcasting total puerto rico banks broadcasting total puerto rico banks broadcasting total net revenues operating income loss net income loss liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds for working capital have historically been cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
at december   we had cash of million and a million revolving credit facility  of which million was available as of december   subject to certain covenant restrictions 
our available balance under our revolving credit facility as of march   was million as a result of the purchase of our senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes class b  as more fully described below 
our total outstanding debt as of december  was million 
this excludes the contingent obligation associated with our guarantee of an million promissory note associated with our joint venture with nbc universal see note commitments and contingencies for further details 
the outstanding debt under our credit facility is due november  and both of our senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes class b are due may  as of december   the total fair value of our outstanding debt was million 
the fair value of the debt was determined using the criteria prescribed under fas because of the operating challenges we face and the potential for cash flow deterioration  moody s investor services downgraded the credit rating on our outstanding corporate debt to ba on august  and to b on december  additionally  on november   standard and poor s ratings services placed the b rating on our corporate debt on credit watch with negative implications 
this  in addition to the decline in the price of our bonds  could make it difficult for us to raise additional capital 
our operating plan for requires that we generate cash from operations and from borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
borrowing under our revolving credit facility is contingent on our compliance with certain financial covenants  which are measured  in part  by the level of cash we generate from our operations 
please see section on description of indebtedness for further discussion regarding our financial covenants 
our ability to generate cash from operations and from borrowings under our credit facility could be adversely affected by a number of the following risks the economic downturn has adversely affected local and national advertising revenues across all of our stations 
local advertising revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to national advertising revenues declined for the year ended december  as compared to approximately  and of our net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from local and national advertising 

table of contents the seasonality of the broadcast business due primarily to political advertising revenues occurring in even years  which will result in significantly decreased political advertising revenues in political advertising revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the current credit crisis could impact our advertisers ability to pay for advertising and the timing of those payments 
we have evaluated our receivables due from customers who are experiencing financial difficulty and the net realizable value of those receivables are not material to our financial position as of december  our days sales outstanding during  and was  and  respectively 
we experienced an improvement in days sales outstanding during as a result of our centralization of credit and collection functions in and the volatility of the equity markets has resulted in the fair value of our pension plan assets declining to million as of december  from million as of december  we contributed million to our pension plan during and anticipate contributing million during the continuing economic downturn and disruptions in the financial markets could significantly increase the cash funding requirements of our pension plan and our pension expense in and thereafter  which would reduce our cash flow from operations 
in addition  the current general economic pressures have affected the two television stations in our joint venture with nbc universal 
nbc universal has an equity interest and we have the remaining equity interest in the joint venture and gecc provided debt financing for the joint venture in the form of the million gecc note  which lin tv has guaranteed 
both nbc universal and gecc are both majority owned subsidiaries of general electric company 
if the operating results of the television stations in the joint venture continue to be adversely affected by the economic downturn  we could experience the following adverse effects cash flow shortfalls at the joint venture caused by a decline in advertising revenues could require us to make cash payments to the joint venture to cover interest obligations under the gecc note 
nbc universal and we have agreed that the joint venture will not distribute any cash to either nbc universal or us in  and will use a portion of its existing debt service reserve cash balances million as of december  to fund interest payments in we have also agreed to waive the requirement of the joint venture to maintain debt service reserve cash balances of million 
additionally  nbc agreed to defer payment of the and management fees 
the annual interest expense on the gecc note is million 
for  we estimate that the cash available to the joint venture will be in the range of million to million less than the amount needed to pay interest on the gecc note during the fourth quarter of the actual cash shortfall could be greater than our current estimate 
nbc universal and we have agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to cover interest payments on the gecc note  we and nbc universal will provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
if we are required to fund a portion of a shortfall loan  we plan to use our available cash balances or available borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  if the joint venture experiences further cash shortfalls beyond  we may decide to fund such cash shortfalls  or to cover such shortfalls through further loans or equity contributions to the joint venture 
under the terms of its guarantee of the gecc note  lin tv would be required to make a payment for an amount to be determined upon occurrence of the following events a there is an event of default which would occur if the joint venture fails to make any scheduled interest payment within days of the date due  b neither nbc universal or us remedy the default  and c after gecc exhausts all remedies against the assets of the joint venture  the total amount realized upon exercise of those remedies is less than the million principal amount of the gecc note 
upon the occurrence of such events  the amount owed by lin tv to gecc pursuant to the guarantee would be calculated as the difference between i the total amount at which the joint venture s assets were sold and ii the principal amount due under the gecc note 
as of december   we estimated that the fair value of the television stations in the joint venture to be approximately million less than the outstanding balance of the gecc note of million 
for further details regarding risks associated with the guarantee of the gecc note  please see item a 
risk factors the gecc note could result in significant liabilities  including i requiring us to make short term cash payments to the nbc universal joint venture to fund interest payments  and ii triggering a change of control under our existing indebtedness  which could cause such indebtedness to become immediately due and payable 

table of contents if an event of default under the gecc note occurs  lin tv  which conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries  could experience material adverse consequences  including a gecc  after exhausting all remedies against the joint venture  could enforce its rights under the guarantee  which could cause lin tv to determine that lin television should seek to sell material assets owned by it in order to satisfy lin tv s obligations under the guarantee  b gecc s initiation of proceedings against lin tv under the guarantee  if they result in material adverse consequences to lin television  would cause an acceleration of lin television s credit facility and other outstanding indebtedness  and c if the gecc note is prepaid because of an acceleration on default or otherwise  we would incur a substantial tax liability of approximately million related to our deferred gain associated with the formation of the joint venture 
we believe that it is remote that there would be an event of default and therefore an acceleration of the principal amount of the gecc note during  although there can be no assurances that such an event of default will not occur 
there are no financial or similar covenants in the gecc note and  since both nbc universal and we have agreed to fund interest payments if the joint venture is unable to do so  nbc universal and we are able to control the occurrence of a default under the gecc note 
we are also exposed to potential losses related to fluctuations in interest rates 
borrowings under our credit facility bear an interest rate based on  at our option  either a the libor interest rate  or b an interest rate that is equal to the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus of percent  and an applicable margin rate of to  depending on us achieving certain financial ratios 
to mitigate changes in our cash flows resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  we entered into the interest rate hedge that effectively converted the floating rate libor rate based payments to fixed payments at plus the applicable margin rate calculated under our credit facility  which expires in our senior subordinated notes bear a fixed interest rate of 
in response to these challenges described above  we have taken the following initiatives during the fourth quarter of  we completed a restructuring plan that included a workforce reduction and the cancellation of certain syndicated television program and operating contracts 
the total charge for the plan was million  including million for workforce reduction and million for the cancellation of the contracts 
we made cash payments of million during the fourth quarter of for these restructuring activities 
as of december   we had million in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet for this restructuring and expect to make cash payments of million during the first quarter of and million during the remainder of and the remaining million during and thereafter 
we anticipate savings of approximately million per year from this restructuring  however  if our operational needs change during the year we may not be able to realize all of these savings 
during  we commenced a plan  under rule b under the securities exchange act of  to purchase a portion of our senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes class b 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased a notional amount of million of the senior subordinated notes for million  and through march   including the amounts purchased during  we purchased a total notional amount of million for approximately million 
our objective in pursuing this plan was to lower our outstanding debt  and therefore improve our consolidated leverage ratio 
credit facility borrowings that we used to purchase our senior subordinated notes reduce the available funds under our revolving credit facility for other purposes 
we are using our strong local television station brands and considerable news  sports  weather  traffic and other local video content to develop new revenue streams 
these new revenues are generated from reaching new retransmission consent agreements with pay television companies  developing our television station web sites and launching other new digital services 
our digital revenues increased or million for the year ended december   compared to prior year 
we expect digital revenues to continue to improve into  however  we may see an impact on these revenues from the economic downturn 
we anticipate reduced spending of approximately million on capital expenditures during  compared to capital expenditures of approximately million during additional spending may be required for any unplanned major repairs for equipment failures 

table of contents in june  banks broadcasting signed a purchase agreement to sell knin tv  a cw affiliate in boise  for million to journal broadcasting 
the fcc approved the transfer of the fcc license for this station to journal broadcasting in january although the sale was scheduled to close on march   journal broadcasting declined to close and has asserted that a condition to its obligation to close has not been satisfied 
banks broadcasting believes that all conditions to closing have been fully satisfied and that journal broadcasting has breached its obligation to complete the transaction 
banks broadcasting intends to pursue all rights and remedies available to it to complete the transaction in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
we expect to receive total net cash proceeds from the sale of approximately million during the first half of when the sale is completed 
we have also assessed the impact the current market conditions could have on third parties with whom we do business  specifically as it relates to our interest rate swap and insurance contracts 
management performs a quarterly assessment of the critical terms of the interest rate swap including  among other matters  an assessment of the counterparties creditworthiness 
based on our assessment at december   we do not believe there is a significant risk associated with the credit worthiness of our interest rate swap counterparty 
given current economic conditions  management also reviewed the insurance contracts associated with our facilities and business continuity insurance providers and noted no material credit risks 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception and have a stockholders deficit as of december  the current economic downturn and credit crisis has had a significant impact on the demand for advertising within the markets our stations operate 
based on our projections for  which we believe use reasonable assumptions regarding the current economic environment  we estimate that cash flows from our operations  together with cash available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements over the next months  including scheduled interest and required principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness and ongoing capital expenditures and projected working capital needs 
in addition  based on our projections  we believe that we will remain in compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreement over the next four quarters 
our projections assume that advertising revenues will decrease significantly in compared to  resulting from a significant decline of political advertising sales due to significantly fewer political elections in odd numbered years  and resulting from the continued decline of local and national advertising as a result of the current economic environment 
if the actual decline of advertising revenues is greater than our budget assumptions  we believe that our cost reduction initiatives  or additional cost reduction initiatives that we may take in the future  should allow us to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and to maintain compliance with our financial debt covenants over the next four quarters 
those initiatives may include  among other things  decreases in headcount  salaries and related benefits  reductions of business travel and advertising expenditures and other general cost savings 
we cannot assure  however  that actual advertising revenues will not be significantly less than our budgeted advertising revenues 
if actual advertising revenues are significantly less than our budgeted advertising revenues  and we are unable to effect cost reduction initiatives in addition to those described above  and or we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from other sources to offset the decline in advertising revenues  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our cash requirements over the next months  including scheduled interest and required principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness and ongoing capital expenditures and projected working capital needs 
in addition  if revenues are significantly less than our budgeted revenues  and or we are unable to effect additional cost reduction initiatives or generate sufficient revenues from other sources  and or we are required to fund our joint venture with nbc universal for amounts greater than we anticipate  as described above  we may need to seek a waiver of  or an amendment to  the financial covenants in our credit agreement 
if we are unable to secure such a waiver or amendment  we may not be in compliance with our financial debt covenants  and our lenders and the holders of our senior subordinated notes and our senior subordinated notes class b could demand immediate repayment of all of our outstanding debt 
under these circumstances  the acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that our cash flows from our current operations  together with available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next months 
these cash requirements include working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments 
our anticipated cash payments for our debt and related interest are described below

the fair values of our long term debt are estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues  or based on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities 
the carrying amounts and fair values of our long term debt were determined using the three level hierarchy established by fas and are as follows in thousands december  carrying amount fair value off balance sheet arrangements gecc note we have guaranteed the gecc note  which is a million year non amortizing senior secured note bearing an initial interest rate of per annum until march  and per annum thereafter 
the gecc note was assumed by our joint venture with nbc universal in and in the event of a default and acceleration of the note  our guarantee would require lin tv to pay any shortfall should the assets of the joint venture be liquidated and not be sufficient to satisfy the principal amount due under the gecc note 
the gecc note is not lin tv or lin television s obligation nor the obligation of any of our subsidiaries and has recourse only to the joint venture  our equity interest in the joint venture and  after exhausting all remedies against the assets of the joint venture and the other equity interest in the joint venture  to lin tv pursuant to its guarantee 
acceleration of the gecc note upon an event of default  and gecc s pursuit of remedies against lin tv pursuant to the guarantee  could  if they result in material adverse consequences to lin television  cause an acceleration of lin television s credit facility and other outstanding indebtedness 

table of contents cash flow shortfalls at the joint venture caused by a decline in advertising revenues could require us to make cash payments to the joint venture to cover interest obligations under the gecc note 
nbc universal and we have agreed that the joint venture will not distribute any cash to either nbc universal or us in  and will use a portion of its existing cash balances million as of december  to fund interest payments in we have agreed to waive the requirement of the joint venture to maintain debt service reserve cash balances of million 
the annual interest expense on the gecc note is million 
we estimate that the cash available to the joint venture will be in the range of million to million less than the amount needed to pay interest on the gecc note during the fourth quarter of the actual cash shortfall could be greater than our current estimate 
nbc universal and we have agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to cover interest payments on the gecc note  we and nbc universal will provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
if we are required to fund a portion of a shortfall loan  we plan to use our available cash balances or available borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  if the joint venture experiences further cash shortfalls beyond  we may decide to fund such cash shortfalls  or to cover such shortfalls through further loans or equity contributions to the joint venture 
for more information about the gecc note  see the description of the nbc universal joint venture in item business development of our business our television stations and item a 
risk factors the gecc note could result in significant liabilities  including i requiring us to make short term cash payments to the nbc universal joint venture to fund interest payments  and ii triggering a change of control under our existing indebtedness  which could cause such indebtedness to become immediately due and payable  as well as the description of the gecc note in note commitments and contigencies to our consolidated financial statements 
future program rights agreements we account for program rights and obligations in accordance with fas  financial reporting by broadcasters fas  which requires us to record program rights agreements on our balance sheet on the first broadcast date the programs are available for air 
as a result  we have commitments for future program rights agreements not recorded on our balance sheet at december  of million  as detailed in note commitments and contingencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to interest rates on our credit facility debt 
we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates 
in accordance with our policy  we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
interest rate risk our long term debt at december  was million  including current portion of million  of which  the senior subordinated notes bear a fixed interest rate and the credit facility bears an interest rate based on  at our option  either a the libor interest rate  or b an interest rate that is equal to the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 
in addition  the rate we select also bears an applicable margin rate of 
to depending on us achieving certain financial ratios 
our credit facility outstanding balance was million at december  accordingly  we are exposed to potential losses related to increases in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase in the floating rate used as the basis for the interest charged on the credit facility as of december  would result in an estimated million increase in annualized interest expense assuming a constant balance outstanding of million less the notional amount of the declining balances of our term loans covered with an interest rate swap agreement 
if we incur additional indebtedness or amend or replace our current indebtedness  the recent sub prime mortgage market crisis and its pervasive effect on general credit market liquidity may impact our ability to refinance our debt or to refinance our debt on terms similar to our existing debt agreements 
during the second quarter of  we entered into a contract to hedge a notional amount of the declining balances of our term loans interest rate hedge 
to mitigate changes in our cash flows resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  we entered into the interest rate hedge that effectively converted the floating libor rate based payments to fixed payments at plus the applicable margin rate calculated under our credit facility  which expires in november we designated the interest rate hedge as a cash flow hedge 
the fair value of the interest rate hedge liability was million at december  this amount will be released into earnings over the life of the interest rate hedge through periodic interest payments
