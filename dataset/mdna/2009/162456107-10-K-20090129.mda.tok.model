this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview founded in  we are a leading marketer and manufacturer of a broad portfolio of branded over the counter otc healthcare products  toiletries and dietary supplements including such categories as medicated skin care  topical pain care  oral care  internal otc  medicated dandruff shampoos  dietary supplements and other otc and toiletry products 
our portfolio of products includes well recognized brands such as gold bond  cortizone and balmex medicated skin care  icy hot  aspercreme and capzasin topical pain care  act and herpecin l oral care  unisom  pamprin and kaopectate internal otc  selsun blue medicated dandruff shampoos  dexatrim  garlique and new phase dietary supplements  and bullfrog  ultraswim and sun in other otc and toiletry products 
our products target niche markets that are often outside the focus of larger companies where we believe we can achieve and sustain significant market share through innovation and strong advertising and promotion support 
many of our products are among the us market leaders in their respective categories 
for example  our portfolio of topical analgesic brands  our cortizone anti itch ointment and our gold bond medicated body powders have the leading us market share in their respective categories 
we support our brands through extensive and cost effective advertising and promotion  the expenditures for which represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal we sell our products nationally through mass merchandiser  drug and food channels  principally utilizing our own sales force 
developments during fiscal products in fiscal  we introduced the following product line extensions unisom sleep melts  cortizone intensive healing  gold bond ultimate restoring lotion  gold bond ultimate foot cream  gold bond ultimate soothing lotion  icy hot pm lotion  icy hot pm patch  aspercreme heat pain relieving gel  aspercreme nighttime lotion  dexatrim max daytime control and dexatrim max complex product recall on february   we initiated a voluntary nationwide recall of our icy hot heat therapy product 
icy hot heat therapy is an air activated  self heating disposable device for temporary relief of muscular and joint pain 
we recalled these products because we received some consumer reports of first  second and third degree burns and skin irritation resulting from the use or possible misuse of the product 
based in part on consideration of on hand factory inventory and retail point of sales data  during the first quarter of fiscal we recorded an estimate of approximately million of recall expenses related to product returns  inventory obsolescence  destruction costs  consumer refunds  legal fees and other estimated expenses 
subsequent to our first fiscal quarter  we increased our estimate of recall expenses by million  to a total of million  primarily as a result of additional legal fees and settlement payments 
the remaining accrued liability for product recall expenses was million as of november  loss on early extinguishment of debt during the first quarter of fiscal  we utilized borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of our credit facility to repay million of the term loan under the credit facility 
in connection with the term loan repayment  we retired a proportional share of the term loan debt issuance costs and recorded the resulting loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
stock repurchase during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program for million at an average price per share of 
litigation settlement during the third quarter of fiscal  we reached a settlement on all known claims alleging pulmonary arterial hypertension as a result of the ingestion of dexatrim products in through included as litigation settlement in the consolidated statements of income is the settlement of the claims totaling million and million of legal expenses  which were partially offset by million of proceeds from the dexatrim litigation settlement trust 
subsequent event on december  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes due convertible notes 
upon completion of the transaction  the balance of the remaining convertible notes was reduced to million outstanding

several different estimates or methods can be used by management that might yield different results 
the following are the significant estimates used by management in the preparation of the november  consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts as of november   an estimate was made of the collectibility of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate requires the utilization of outside credit services  knowledge about the customer and the customer s industry  new developments in the customer s industry and operating results of the customer as well as general economic conditions and historical trends 
when all these facts are compiled  a judgment as to the collectibility of the individual account is made 
many factors can impact this estimate  including those noted in this paragraph 
the adequacy of the estimated allowance may be impacted by the deterioration in the financial condition of a large customer  weakness in the economic environment resulting in a higher level of customer bankruptcy filings or delinquencies and the competitive environment in which the customer operates 
during the year ended november   we performed an assessment of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable and did not make any significant adjustments to our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the balance of allowance for doubtful accounts was million at november  and revenue recognition revenue is recognized when our products are shipped and title transfers to our customers 
it is generally our policy across all classes of customers that all sales are final 
as is common in the consumer products industry  customers return products for a variety of reasons including products damaged in transit  discontinuance of a particular size or form of product and shipping errors 
as sales are recorded  we accrue an estimated amount for product returns  as a reduction of these sales  based upon our historical experience and consideration of discontinued products  product divestitures  estimated inventory levels held by our customers and retail point of sale data on existing and newly introduced products 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels and competitive conditions 
we charge the allowance account for product returns when the customer provides appropriate supporting documentation that the product is properly destroyed or upon receipt of the product 
we separate returns into the two categories of seasonal and non seasonal products 
we use the historical return detail of seasonal and non seasonal products for at least the most recent three fiscal years on generally all products  which is normalized for any specific occurrence that is not reasonably likely to recur  to determine the amount of product returned as a percentage of sales  and estimate an allowance for potential returns based on product sold in the current period 
to consider product sold in current and prior periods  an estimate of inventory held by our retail customers is calculated based on customer inventory detail 
this estimate of inventory held by our customers  along with historical returns as a percentage of sales  is used to determine an estimate of potential product returns 
this estimate of the allowance for seasonal and non seasonal returns is further analyzed by considering retail customer point of sale data 
we also consider specific events  such as discontinued product or product divestitures  when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
our estimate of product returns for seasonal and non seasonal products was million and million as of november   and million and million as of november  and november  due to higher sales volume during fiscal  we increased our estimate of seasonal returns by approximately million  which resulted in a decrease to net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
higher sales volume in fiscal offset by customers returning seasonal products earlier in the season resulted in our estimate of returns for seasonal products remaining consistent as compared to fiscal during fiscal and  our estimate of non seasonal returns remained consistent as compared to fiscal and  respectively 
each percentage point change in the seasonal return rate would impact net sales by approximately million 
each percentage point change in the non seasonal return rate would impact net sales by approximately million 
at november   based on consideration of the sales of icy hot pro therapy performing below expectations  review of retail point of sales data throughout fiscal and an estimate of inventory on hand at customers  we estimated returns of icy hot pro therapy as of november  of million  which was included as a reduction of net sales 
during fiscal  we continued to monitor icy hot pro therapy retail sales and inventory levels on hand at customers and increased the specific reserve for icy hot pro therapy by million as of november   which is included as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
as of november   the allowance remaining for icy hot pro therapy returns was million 
during fiscal  based on a revised estimate of inventory held by customers  we reduced the estimated remaining liability for returns by million  which resulted in an increase to net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
as of november   the allowance remaining for icy hot pro therapy returns is million 
we routinely enter into agreements with customers to participate in promotional programs 
the cost of these programs is recorded as either advertising and promotion expense or as a reduction of sales as prescribed by emerging issues task force  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
a significant portion of the programs are recorded as a reduction of sales and generally take the form of coupons and vendor allowances  which are normally taken via temporary price reductions  scan downs  display activity and participations in in store programs provided uniquely by the customer 
we also enter into cooperative advertising programs with certain customers  the cost of which is recorded as advertising and promotion expense 
in order for retailers to receive reimbursement under such programs  the retailer must meet specified advertising guidelines and provide appropriate documentation of the advertisement being run 
we analyze promotional programs in two primary categories coupons and vendor allowances 
customers normally utilize vendor allowances in the form of temporary price reductions  scan downs  display activity and participations in in store programs provided uniquely by the customer 
we estimate the accrual for outstanding coupons by utilizing a third party clearinghouse to track coupons issued  coupon value  distribution and expiration dates  quantity distributed and estimated redemption rates that are provided by us 
we estimate the redemption rates based on internal analysis of historical coupon redemption rates and expected future retail sales by considering recent point of sale data 
the estimate for vendor allowances is based on estimated unit sales of a product under a program and amounts committed for such programs in each fiscal year 
estimated unit sales are determined by considering customer forecasted sales  point of sale data and the nature of the program being offered 
the three most recent years of expected program payments versus actual payments made and current year retail point of sale trends are analyzed to determine future expected payments 
customer delays in requesting promotional program payments due to their audit of program participation and resulting request for reimbursement is also considered to evaluate the accrual for vendor allowances 
the costs of these programs are often variable based on the number of units actually sold 
as of november   the coupon accrual and reserve for vendor allowances were million and million  respectively  and million and million  respectively  as of november  each percentage point change in promotional program participation would impact net sales by million and advertising and promotion expense by an insignificant amount 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas  fin  fsp fin and other applicable fsp s and fasb interpretations 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
we adopted fin  as amended by fsp fin  on december  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas in connection with the adoption of fin  we recognized an increase in the unrecognized tax benefits of million  which is included in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction to retained earnings of million and an increase to deferred tax assets of million 
we had a total unrecognized tax benefit of million as of december  our effective tax rate was for fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations as prescribed by sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
under sfas  the cost  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
business combinations consummated beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal will be accounted for under sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
we account for our intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset or a value is assigned to an indefinite lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
an area that requires significant judgment is the fair value and useful lives of intangible assets 
in this process  we often obtain the assistance of a third party valuation firm for certain intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of exclusive brand licenses  trademarks and other intellectual property  customer relationships and non compete agreements 
we have determined that our trademarks have indefinite useful lives  as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely 
the useful lives of our intangible assets are reviewed as circumstances dictate in accordance with the provisions of sfas the value of our intangible assets is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying value of the intangible assets to their estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value is determined by discounting the estimate of future cash flows of the intangible assets 
consistent with our policy  we perform the annual impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets during the quarter ended november  with the most recent test performed in the quarter ended november  no impairment or adjustment to the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets was required as a result of this testing 
in january  we completed the acquisition of the us rights to five consumer and otc brands from johnson johnson j j acquisition 
the acquired brands were act  unisom  cortizone  kaopectate  and balmex 
in may  we acquired the worldwide trademark and rights to sell and market act in western europe from johnson johnson act acquisition 
fair value measurements on december   we adopted sfas as it pertains to financial assets and liabilities  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas applies both to items recognized and reported at fair value in the financial statements and to items disclosed at fair value in the notes to the financial statements 
sfas does not change existing accounting rules governing what can or must be recognized and reported at fair value and clarifies that fair value is defined as the price received to sell an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
additionally  sfas does not eliminate practicability exceptions that exist in accounting pronouncements amended by sfas when measuring fair value 
as a result  we are not required to recognize any new assets or liabilities at fair value 
sfas defers the date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities and is effective in our fiscal sfas also establishes a framework for measuring fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
if quoted market prices are not available  sfas provides guidance on alternative valuation techniques that place greater reliance on observable inputs and less reliance on unobservable inputs 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas r  which requires the recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements and is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using a flex lattice model 
the input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life of the stock options  the expected volatility of our common stock  the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option and the expected forfeiture rate of the options granted 
we recognize stock option compensation expense over the period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award the vesting period

fiscal compared to fiscal to facilitate discussion of our operating results for the years ended november  and  we have included the following selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands domestic net sales international revenues including royalties total revenues cost of sales advertising and promotion expense selling  general and administrative expense product recall expenses acquisition expenses litigation settlement interest expense loss on early extinguishment of debt net income domestic net sales domestic net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal a comparison of domestic net sales for the categories of products included in our portfolio of otc healthcare products is as follows for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands medicated skin care topical pain care oral care internal otc medicated dandruff shampoos dietary supplements other otc and toiletry products total net sales growth in the medicated skin care category increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the launch of gold bond ultimate restoring lotion and cortizone intensive healing in the first quarter of fiscal  the continued success of gold bond ultimate softening lotion and our ownership of the cortizone and balmex brands for the entire twelve month period of fiscal compared to only eleven months of ownership in fiscal net sales in the topical pain care category increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  principally due to increases in icy hot and aspercreme  led by the new products introduced in the first quarter of fiscal  icy hot pm lotion  icy hot pm patch  aspercreme heat pain gel and aspercreme nighttime lotion  offset by declines in capzasin and the discontinuance of shipments of icy hot heat therapy following our february  voluntary recall of the product 
excluding sales of icy hot heat therapy and icy hot pro therapy  sales in the category increased compared to the prior year period 
net sales in the oral care category increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase primarily results from our ownership of the act brand for the entire twelve month period of fiscal compared to only eleven months of ownership in fiscal and an expanded distribution base 
net sales in the internal otc category increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our ownership of the unisom and kaopectate brands for the entire twelve month period of fiscal compared to only eleven months of ownership in fiscal and the introduction of unisom sleepmelts in the second quarter of fiscal net sales in the medicated dandruff shampoos category decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to declining sales of selsun salon  which were partially offset by a full year of sales of selsun blue naturals  which began shipping in the second quarter of fiscal net sales in the dietary supplements category decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales of dexatrim decreased primarily resulting from increased competitive pressures in the diet aid category  a decline in sales of dexatrim maxo and increased returns of dexatrim mainly from several retailers discontinuing dexatrim maxo  partially offset by the launch of dexatrim max daytime control in the first quarter of fiscal and dexatrim max complex  which began shipping in the third quarter of fiscal net sales in the other otc and toiletry products category increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal driven primarily by an increase in fourth quarter shipments of bullfrog as a result of expanded distribution in key retailers and the early season shipments of upgraded product formulas for the suncare season

advertising and promotion expense advertising and promotion expenses in fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal and were of total revenues for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in advertising and promotion expenses results from higher expenditures for advertising and promotion in fiscal in connection with the ownership of the brands acquired in the j j acquisition for the entire twelve month period of fiscal as compared to eleven months of ownership in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were and of total revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues was largely attributable to the absorption of transition service costs similar to those paid to johnson johnson related to freight and administrative costs that were recorded as acquisition expenses in fiscal and an increase in fuel costs in resulting in higher outbound freight expense 
product recall expenses on february   we initiated a voluntary nationwide recall of our icy hot heat therapy product 
icy hot heat therapy is an air activated  self heating disposable device for temporary relief of muscular and joint pain 
we recalled these products because we received some consumer reports of first  second and third degree burns and skin irritation resulting from the use or possible misuse of the product 
based in part on consideration of on hand factory inventory and retail point of sales data  during the first quarter of fiscal we recorded an estimate of approximately million of recall expenses related to product returns  inventory obsolescence  destruction costs  consumer refunds  legal fees and other estimated expenses

liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings 
our principal uses of cash are for operating expenses  servicing long term debt  acquisitions  working capital  repurchases of our common stock  payment of income taxes and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal increased million to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher net income  an increase in deferred taxes  a decrease in inventory as the integration of manufacturing of certain of the acquired brands from the j j acquisition has been completed and a decrease in the change in accounts receivable as compared to the fiscal change in accounts receivable as a result of the fiscal revenue increase from the j j acquisition 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction in the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as compared to the fiscal change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of the j j acquisition 
investing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities was a result of lower purchases of equipment for manufacturing operations in fiscal and the absence of an acquisition in fiscal like the j j acquisition in fiscal financing activities used cash of million and provided cash of million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the financing activities cash was used to reduce borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and repurchase shares of our common stock 
in fiscal  the financing activities cash was provided to fund the j j acquisition and was partially offset by cash used to reduce borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and repurchase shares of our common stock

effective april   our board of directors increased the authorization to repurchase up to an additional million of our common stock under the terms of a stock repurchase program  and there remains million available under such authorization to repurchase shares 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  our cash and cash equivalents balance and funds available under the revolving credit facility portion of our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures  debt service and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future as our business is currently conducted 
it is likely that any acquisitions we make in the future will require us to obtain additional financing 
if additional financing is required  there are no assurances that it will be available  or  if available  that it can be obtained on terms favorable to us or not dilutive to our future earnings 
contractual obligations the following data summarizes our contractual obligations as of november  we had no commercial obligations as of november  payments due by contractual obligations total within year years years after years dollars in thousands long term debt interest payments operating leases purchase commitments endorsements total purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
other than as presented in the table above  we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or fixed prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we have also excluded from the table above the liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty of payment and amount of payment per period 
as of november   we have a gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest payments consist of interest at the november  effective rate of per annum on the million revolving credit facility portion of our credit facility due  the november  effective rate of per annum on the million term loan portion of our credit facility due  the subordinated notes due  the convertible notes due and the convertible notes due we have no existing off balance sheet financing arrangements

in connection with the act acquisition  we have been conducting business in greece through chattem greece  a wholly owned subsidiary located in alimos attica  greece 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we established chattem peru srl chattem peru a wholly owned subsidiary located in lima  peru 
chattem peru utilizes third party distributors to sell certain of our selsun blue products throughout peru 
the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are canadian dollars  british pounds and euros  respectively 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact operating results  including total revenues and expenses  when translations of the subsidiary financial statements are made in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
for fiscal and  these subsidiaries accounted for of total consolidated revenues  respectively  and of total consolidated assets  respectively 
it has not been our practice to hedge our assets and liabilities in canada  the uk  ireland  greece  and peru or our intercompany transactions due to the inherent risks associated with foreign currency hedging transactions and the timing of payments between us and our foreign subsidiaries 
historically  gains or losses from foreign currency transactions have not had a material impact on our operating results 
losses of million and gains of million from foreign currency transactions for the years ended november  and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income
