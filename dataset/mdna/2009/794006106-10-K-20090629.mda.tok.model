table of contents with our fiscal acquisitions of infobasis limited infobasis and genesys software systems  inc genesys  we further expanded our addressable market 
infobasis provides customers with competency based learning and development software and genesys offers a broad range of on demand and licensed human resources management systems and payroll solutions  including benefits and tax filing services 
these acquisitions have also given us the ability to offer our customers a bundled package that includes our hr data and point solution tools for compensation and competency management  our strategic talent management solutions for performance management  compensation and succession planning  and learning and development and our transactional hr solutions for payroll  tax  benefits  hrms and employee self service 
we are working to further leverage the synergies among our different products by developing a single  integrated product suite that will contain all of these elements 
we believe that an integrated product suite will offer a cost effective way to automate performance and develop a strong internal pipeline of leaders beyond what can be achieved through bundling our products 
we were organized as a delaware corporation in as of march   our enterprise subscriber base has grown to more than  companies who spend from  to more than  annually 
we have achieved consecutive quarters of revenue growth since april during the year ended march  we had operating cash outflows of during the fiscal years ended march  and  we achieved positive operating cash flows of million and million  respectively 
during these periods  we have incurred operating losses  including million for  million for and million for as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
strategic initiatives fiscal was a transformation year for us and during the year we made significant progress towards our long term vision 
we started the year as the on demand leader in compensation management and an emerging leader in on demand talent management 
through internal investment and acquisitions  we ended the year as a provider of a full range of hr solutions 
in a single purchase  our customers can now acquire hr data and point solution tools for compensation and competency management  strategic talent management solutions for performance management  compensation and succession planning  and learning and development and transactional hr solutions for payroll  tax  benefits  hrms and employee self service 
we believe this expansion of our offerings will increase our long term success  especially as we continue to integrate the applications we obtained in the genesys acquisition and work to integrate our solutions into a single product suite 
from a market perspective  we continue to believe that the on demand hr categories are high growth markets 
we believe that on demand software and data are superior to legacy software and services offerings 
given the lower up front cost and total cost of ownership  we believe that more companies will switch to on demand hr solutions  and that we are leading the way with the broadest on demand hr offering 
we are committed to an operating philosophy that is focused on generating cash flow from operations without sacrificing future growth 
in line with this philosophy our sales and marketing team is focused on acquiring new customers profitably and cross selling to existing customers  we are continuing to invest in the core content and technology development initiatives that drive market leadership positions across our existing businesses  and our services teams remain staffed at levels that allow us to continue delivering best in class service to our customers 
our pipeline of sales opportunities  both into new customers and existing customers  continues to expand with more products  more bundled sales  and larger transactions and our product line strategy focuses on product excellence to take and command category leadership positions 
we are continuing to invest in extending our own 
table of contents products  and re coding products we acquire  to ensure we remain a provider of integrated best of breed solutions 
we believe that in today s challenging economic environment  these strategic initiatives will help us continue to grow our business  gain market acceptance for our bundled products and achieve positive cash flow 
prior to september  we pursued a strategy of significantly increasing our investment in sales and marketing and expanding our sales and marketing teams 
as a result of the recent financial crisis in the credit markets and difficulties in the financial services sector and continuing geopolitical uncertainties  the direction and relative strength of the us and global economy have become increasingly uncertain 
this uncertainty has caused our current and potential customers to reduce spending on new it and hr solutions such as ours  which in turn slowed our historical growth levels 
this slowdown resulted in less of a return on our increased investment in sales and marketing than we expect would have entered in a more robust economy 
in order to meet this changing economic environment  we have refocused our strategy away from expanding marketing and sales and towards reducing our expenses  leveraging our current infrastructure and providing solutions that integrate compensation management  talent management and hrms payroll into a single purchase of products that are more efficient for our customers 
during fiscal  we reduced our workforce by which is expected to reduce our future annual operating expenses by approximately million 
we expect to continue to seek alternatives to reduce expenses and achieve positive cash flow  while still supporting our customers and products  although we expect that any reductions in expenses in fiscal will be more moderate as compared to fiscal we also believe that our investments over the past year in these sales and marketing initiatives created critical infrastructure  which we believe will serve as a basis for future growth and allow us to continue to attract new customers and provide high level products and support  without significant additional short term investments 
we have made five acquisitions of businesses since our initial public offering in february through these acquisitions we have been able to expand our product offerings and make significant progress towards our long term vision we describe above 
the expansion of our product offerings has expanded our addressable market and significantly contributed to our growth in revenue and our business volumes 
although  we expect to slow the number business acquisitions  future and historical acquisitions remain a significant component to our growth strategy for fiscal as we continue to integrate these acquisitions and execute of our strategy of integrating our solutions into a single product suite 
by pursuing these strategic initiatives  we believe that we can continue to take and extend product and market leadership in the niche categories in which we compete while building a strong competitive position for our on demand total hr suite 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees and  to a lesser extent  through advertising on our website 
for the years ended march   and  subscription revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues and for the years ended march   and  advertising revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
we expect our subscription revenues will continue to account for an increasing percentage of our revenues as we continue to focus on subscription based compensation management  performance management and hrms payroll products 
subscription revenues are comprised primarily of subscription fees from enterprise and small business customers who pay a bundled fee for our on demand software applications and data products and implementation services related to our subscription products  sales of payroll perpetual licenses  maintenance and hosting services including related implementation and consulting services  as well as syndication fees from our website partners and premium membership subscriptions sold primarily to individuals 
subscription revenues are primarily recognized ratably over the contract period as they are earned 
our subscription agreements for our enterprise subscription customer base are typically one to five years in length  and as of march   approximately of our contracts were more than one year in length 
we generally invoice our customers annually in advance of their subscription for both new sales and renewals  with the majority of the payments typically due upon receipt of invoice 
deferred revenue consists primarily of billings or payments received in 
table of contents advance of revenue recognition from our subscription agreements and is recognized over time as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
deferred revenue does not include the unbilled portion of multi year customer contracts  which is held off the balance sheet 
changes in deferred revenue generally indicate the trend for subscription revenues over the following year as the current portion of deferred revenue is expected to be recognized as revenue within months 
to a lesser extent  subscription revenues also include fees for professional services which are not bundled with our subscription products  revenues from sales of job competency models and related implementation services and revenue from the sale of our compensation market study and salary 
com survey products  which are not sold on a subscription basis 
advertising revenues are comprised of revenues that we generate through agreements to display third party advertising on our website for a fixed period of time or fixed number of impressions 
advertising revenues are recognized as the advertising is displayed on the website 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of costs for data acquisition and data development  fees paid to our network provider for the hosting and managing of our servers  related bandwidth costs  compensation costs for the support and implementation of our products  compensation costs related to our consulting and professional services business and amortization of capitalized software costs 
although we took significant expense reducing measures in fiscal  we continue to implement and support our new and existing products and expand our data sets and we expect that over the next few years cost of revenues will continue to increase as a percentage of revenue and on an absolute dollar basis 
over the longer term  we expect our cost of revenues to decrease as a percentage of revenue as our business grows and our new data products gain market acceptance 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our software and data application development personnel 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on improving and enhancing our existing on demand software and data offerings as well as developing new features  functionality and products 
we expect that our addition of hrms payroll solutions to our line of products will require us to focus additional research and development efforts on creating a single integrated product suite that encompasses all of our solutions 
we expect that in the future  research and development expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  including sales commissions  as well as the costs of our marketing programs 
the direct sales commissions for our subscription sales are capitalized at the time a subscription agreement is executed by a customer and we recognize the initial year sales commission expense ratably over one year 
in the case of multi year agreements  upon billing the customer for each additional year  we incur a subsequent sales commission and recognize the expense for such commission over the applicable year 
typically  a majority of the sales commission is recognized in the initial year of the subscription term 
in fiscal  we invested substantially in sales and marketing  which resulted in increased sales and marketing expenses 
we do not expect to make similar expenditures in the near term and  as a result  we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will decrease in the upcoming fiscal year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation expenses for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  administrative and management information systems personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including rent and depreciation expense

as a result of the workforce reduction  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
these charges were comprised of million in stock compensation charges associated with the accelerated vesting of unvested awards  million in severance payments  and million in various other costs 
we expect the reduction in workforce to yield approximately million in pre tax annual cost savings 
in february  we entered into a new office lease for our wholly foreign owned enterprise in montego bay  jamaica 
the lease is for approximately square meters and has an initial term of two years  commencing in november we can extend the lease for an additional year at the end of the initial term 
given our current cash and accounts receivable  we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our business and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in the future in the event that we pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses or technologies or experience operating losses that exceed our expectations 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all 
during the last four fiscal years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in the consolidated balance sheet 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on liquidity 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of 
table of contents facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following table discloses our contractual payment obligations as of march  as of march   we did not have any material purchase obligations  capital leases  or other material long term commitments reflected on our balance sheet 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases revolving credit facility contractual commitments total the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment  complexity and effect on materiality 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments for uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenues from subscription agreements for our on demand software and related services when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fee is probable and the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
our subscription agreements generally contain multiple service elements and deliverables 
these elements include access to our software and often specify initial services including implementation and training 
except under limited circumstances  our subscription agreements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  issued by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  in may  and statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  or sop no 
 we define all elements in our multiple element subscription agreements as a single unit of accounting  and accordingly  recognize all associated revenue over the subscription period  which is typically one 
table of contents to five years in length 
in the event professional services relating to implementation are required  we generally do not recognize revenue until such implementation is complete 
in applying the guidance in eitf and sop  we determined that we do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the subscription to our on demand software after delivery of specified initial services 
we therefore account for our subscription arrangements and our related service fees as a single unit 
additionally  we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including implementation  consulting  training services and postcontract customer support pcs 
on certain software license arrangements  we have established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for postcontract customer support  using the substantive renewal rate method 
for arrangements for which we have established vsoe  we allocate revenue using vsoe for the postcontract customer support pcs and the residual method for the other elements and accounts for other elements as a single unit of accounting 
the revenue related to the postcontract customer support for which we have established vsoe is recognized ratably from the delivery date of the license through the contract period 
if we are not able to establish vsoe on postcontract customer support  and postcontract customer support is the only undelivered element  then all revenue from the arrangement is recognized ratably over the contract period 
however  if vsoe is not established but pcs has been delivered  then all revenue from the arrangement is recognized ratably over the contract period once the last element is delivered 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
as of march   we have a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold and measurement requirements a tax position must meet before being recognized as a benefit in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods and disclosures for uncertain tax positions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of fin on april  did not result in the recognition of a tax liability for any previously unrecognized tax benefits and did not have an effect on our financial position or results of operations as we had a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
software development costs 
we capitalize certain internal software development costs under the provisions of statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be charged to operations as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and the post implementation stages are expensed as incurred 
certain qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized as property  equipment and software 
these costs generally consist of internal labor during configuration  coding  and testing activities 
capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete  management with the relevant authority authorizes and commits to the funding of the software project  and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended 
these costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software  generally three years 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to pay us 
the provision is based on our historical experience and for specific customers that  in our opinion  are likely to default on our receivables from them 
in order to identify these customers  we perform ongoing reviews of all customers that have breached their payment terms  as well as 
table of contents those that have filed for bankruptcy or for whom information has become available indicating a significant risk of non recoverability 
in addition  we have experienced significant growth in the number of our customers  and we have less payment history to rely upon with these customers 
we rely on historical trends of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue and apply these percentages to the accounts receivable associated with new customers and evaluate these customers over time 
to the extent that our future collections differ from our assumptions based on historical experience  the amount of our bad debt and allowance recorded may be different 
stock based compensation 
we follow the provisions of fas r  which requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements over the vesting period and that such expense be measured at the fair value of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards and stock price volatility 
beginning in fiscal year  we have used the black scholes option pricing model to value our option grants and determine the related compensation expense 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had adopted sfas  but in accordance with sfas  we had elected not to apply fair value based accounting for awards under our employee stock incentive plan through march  instead  we measured compensation expense for our stock plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations and provided pro forma disclosures as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas we have historically estimated our expected volatility based on that of our publicly traded peer companies as we determined that we did not have adequate historical data from our traded share price 
until february  we were a private company and therefore lack sufficient company specific historical and implied volatility information 
the company did not grant any new stock options during the fiscal year ended march   however  previously granted stock option awards were modified in connection with our workforce reduction on january  the modification of the awards consisted of acceleration of the respective awards vesting schedule 
for the modified awards issued during the year ended march   the company determined it has adequate historical data from our traded share price  as such expected volatilities utilized in the model are based on the historic volatility of the company s stock price 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is equal to the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life 
the expected term of the options granted was determined based upon review of the period that our share based awards are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual term of the awards  vesting schedules  employee turnover and expectations of employee exercise behavior 
the stock price volatility and expected terms utilized in the calculation of fair values involve management s best estimates at that time  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the vesting period of the option 
sfas r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
therefore  we have estimated expected forfeitures of stock options with the adoption of sfas r 
in developing a forfeiture rate estimate  we have considered our historical experience  our growing employee base and the historical limited liquidity of our common stock 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 

table of contents we recognized stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r in the amount of million  million and million for fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
as of march   we had million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation awards granted under our equity plans 
the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we follow the guidance of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets or sfas in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and certain intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset is greater than its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historically or projected future operating results  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  significant adverse changes in business climate or regulations  significant changes in senior management  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a decline in our credit rating  or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred includes significant judgment from management 
the estimation of the fair values of goodwill and the reporting units to which it pertains requires the use of discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
these estimates will be determined by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
determining the fair value of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgments could yield different results

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with vendors provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results 
a small percentage of our consolidated revenues and operational expenses consist of international revenues and operational expenses which are denominated in foreign currencies 
exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact those revenues and operating costs 
for the fiscal years ended march   the company incurred foreign exchange losses of million 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rate sensitivity 
interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
however  based on the nature and current level of our investments  which are primarily cash and debt obligations  we believe that there is no material risk of exposure
