item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the company we are the world s largest meat protein company and the second largest food production company in the fortune with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry 
we produce  distribute and market chicken  beef  pork  prepared foods and related allied products 
our operations are conducted in four segments chicken  beef  pork and prepared foods 
some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products  the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace  accessibility of international markets  market prices for our products  the cost of live cattle and hogs  raw materials and grain  and operating efficiencies of our facilities 
overview chicken segment fiscal operating results were negatively impacted in the first half of fiscal by high grain costs and net losses on our commodity risk management activities related to grain and energy purchases 
the second half of fiscal benefited as we had worked through the majority of our long grain positions  had more stable grain prices and made several operational improvements 
operating margins in the first half of fiscal were negative  while the second half improved to positive 
beef segment fiscal operating loss was million  which included a million non cash goodwill impairment 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  operating results doubled as compared to fiscal we sustained our operational improvements made in fiscal and continue to have strong performance  which shows in our fiscal operating results 
beef goodwill impairment we perform our annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis 
this analysis requires us to make various judgmental estimates and assumptions about sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount factors 
the recent disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions led to an increase in our discount rate 
the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to in fiscal from in fiscal there were no significant changes in the other key estimates and assumptions 
the increased discount rate resulted in the non cash partial impairment of our beef reporting unit s goodwill 
the impairment has no impact on management s estimates of the beef segment s long term profitability or value 
pork segment while our operating income was down as compared to the record year we had in fiscal  we still had solid operating earnings of million  or  with strong demand for our products and adequate supplies of hogs 
prepared foods segment in fiscal  we had improvements in our sales volumes  which led to operating margins of 
in addition  we made several operational improvements that allow us to run our plants more efficiently 
liquidity in march  we replaced our then existing billion revolving credit facility set to expire in fiscal with a new billion revolving credit facility which expires in march in addition  we issued million of senior notes 
in conjunction with these transactions  we paid down and terminated our accounts receivable securitization agreement 
these transactions  as well as a significant decrease in our working capital needs  helped to strengthen our liquidity position 
at october   we had nearly billion in total cash including restricted cash  as well as million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
acquisitions in october  we completed the acquisition of three vertically integrated poultry companies in southern brazil 
in august  we acquired equity interest in a joint venture with a vertically integrated poultry operation in eastern china 
in march  we completed the sale of the beef processing  cattle feed yard and fertilizer assets of three of our alberta  canada subsidiaries collectively  lakeside to xl foods inc  a canadian owned beef processing business  and an entity affiliated with xl foods 
we received total consideration of million  which included cash received at closing  collateralized notes receivable and xl foods preferred stock 
our accounting cycle resulted in a week year for fiscal and a week year for both fiscal and in millions  except per share data net income loss net income loss per diluted share net loss includes the following items million non cash  non tax deductible charge related to a goodwill impairment in our beef segment  and million charge related to the closing of our ponca city  oklahoma  processed meats plant

net income includes the following item million of tax expense related to a fixed asset tax cost correction  primarily related to a fixed asset system conversion in fiscal outlook segments chicken at the end of fiscal  industry pullet placements were down as a result of weaker demand 
however  we expect demand will improve as we get further into fiscal  and we expect the pricing environment to improve aided by cold storage inventories which are down relative to the levels we have seen over the last several years 
we also currently expect to see grain costs down as compared to fiscal additionally  we will continue to focus on making operational improvements to help maximize our margins 
beef while we expect a reduction in cattle supplies of in fiscal  we do not expect a significant change in the fundamentals of our beef business as it relates to fiscal we expect adequate supplies to operate our plants 
we will manage our spreads by maximizing our revenues through product mix  minimizing our operating costs  while keeping our focus on quality and customer service 
pork we expect to see a gradual decline in hog supplies through the first half of fiscal  which will accelerate into the second half of fiscal  resulting in industry slaughter slightly higher than or roughly less than fiscal 
however  we still believe we will have adequate supplies in the regions in which we operate 
we will manage our spreads by continuing to control our costs and maximizing our revenues 
prepared foods raw material costs will likely increase in fiscal  but we have made some changes in our sales contracts that move us further away from fixed price contracts toward formula pricing  which will better enable us to absorb rising raw material costs 
with the changes we have made with our sales contracts and the operational efficiencies we made during fiscal  we expect strong results in fiscal summary of results continuing operations sales in millions sales change in sales volume change in average sales price sales growth decline vs

liquidity and capital resources our cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and growth opportunities are expected to be met with current cash on hand  cash flows provided by operating activities  or short term borrowings 
based on our current expectations  we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business 
however  we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance through capital market transactions 
the amount  nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances  our then current commitments and obligations  the amount  nature and timing of our capital requirements  any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements  and overall market conditions

in fiscal  we bought back million notes and repaid the remaining million outstanding lakeside term loan 
in fiscal  we used proceeds from sale of the short term investment to repay our outstanding million notes due october  in addition  we used cash from operations to reduce the amount outstanding under the lakeside term loan by million  repay the outstanding million notes due june   and reduce other borrowings 
net proceeds from borrowings include in fiscal  we issued million of notes 
after the original issue discount of million  based on an issue price of of face value  we received net proceeds of million 
we used the net proceeds towards the repayment of our borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and for other general corporate purposes 
in fiscal  dynamic fuels received million in proceeds from the sale of gulf opportunity zone tax exempt bonds made available by the federal government to the regions affected by hurricane katrina and rita in these floating rate bonds are due october  in fiscal  we issued million convertible senior notes due october  net proceeds were used for the net cost of the related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions  toward the repayment of our borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility  and for other general corporate purposes

our current ratio at october   and september   was to and to  respectively 
deterioration of credit and capital markets credit market conditions deteriorated rapidly during our fourth quarter of fiscal and continued into fiscal several major banks and financial institutions failed or were forced to seek assistance through distressed sales or emergency government measures 
while not all inclusive  the following summarizes some of the impacts to our business credit facility cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service and capital expenditures 
we also have a revolving credit facility  with a committed capacity of billion  to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs  letters of credit  and as a source of financing for growth opportunities 
as of october   we had outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit agreement totaling million  none of which were drawn upon  which left million available for borrowing 
our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of banks  with commitments ranging from million to million per bank 
if any of the banks in the syndicate were unable to perform on their commitments to fund the facility  our liquidity could be impaired  which could reduce our ability to fund working capital needs  support letters of credit or finance our growth opportunities 
customers suppliers the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers could also be impaired by current market conditions 
although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or non performance by suppliers  current market conditions increase the probability we could experience losses from customer or supplier defaults 
should current credit and capital market conditions result in a prolonged economic downturn in the united states and abroad  demand for protein products could be reduced  which could result in a reduction of sales  operating income and cash flows 
in addition  we rely on livestock producers throughout the country to supply our live cattle and hogs 
if these producers are adversely impacted by the current economic conditions and go out of business  our livestock supply for processing could be significantly impacted 
additionally  we have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate 
under these programs  we pay an amount for livestock equivalent to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices 
the amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest 
participating suppliers are obligated to repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost  or upon termination of the agreement 
our maximum obligation associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock supplier s net tangible assets 
although we believe the aggregate maximum obligation under the program is unlikely to ever be reached  the potential maximum obligation as of october   is approximately million 
the total receivables under these programs were million and million at october  and september   respectively 
even though these programs are limited to the net tangible assets of the participating livestock suppliers  we also manage a portion of our credit risk associated with these programs by obtaining security interests in livestock suppliers assets 
after analyzing residual credit risks and general market conditions  we have recorded an allowance for these programs estimated uncollectible receivables of million and million at october   and september   respectively 
investments the value of our investments in equity and debt securities  including our marketable debt securities  company owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets  has been impacted by the market volatility over the past year 
these instruments were recorded at fair value as of october  during fiscal  we had a reduction in fair value resulting in the recognition through earnings of million 
we currently oversee two domestic and one foreign subsidiary non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans 
all three pension plans are frozen to new participants and no additional benefits will accrue for participants 
based on our actuarial valuation  we anticipate contributions of million to these plans for fiscal we also have one domestic unfunded defined benefit plan 
based on our actuarial valuation  we anticipate contributions of million to this plan for fiscal financial instruments as part of our commodity risk management activities  we use derivative financial instruments  primarily futures and options  to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to commodity purchases 
similar to the capital markets  the commodities markets have been volatile over the past year 
grain and some energy prices reached an all time high during our fourth quarter of fiscal before falling sharply 
while the reduction in grain and energy prices benefit us long term  we recorded losses related to these financial instruments in fiscal of million 
we have recently implemented policies to reduce our earnings volatility associated with mark to market derivative activities  including more use of normal physical purchases and normal physical sales which are not required to be marked to market 
insurance we rely on insurers as a protection against liability claims  property damage and various other risks 
our primary insurers maintain an am best financial strength rating of a or better 
nevertheless  we continue to monitor this situation as insurers have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the current capital market environment 
capitalization in millions senior notes go zone tax exempt bonds other indebtedness total debt total equity debt to capitalization ratio in fiscal  we issued million of notes 
the notes had an original issue discount of million  based on an issue price of of face value 
we used the net proceeds towards the repayment of our borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and for other general corporate purposes

in addition to the amounts shown above in the table  we have unrecognized tax benefits of million and related interest and penalties of million at october   recorded as liabilities 
during fiscal  tax audit resolutions could potentially reduce these amounts by approximately million  either because tax positions are sustained on audit or because we agree to their disallowance
