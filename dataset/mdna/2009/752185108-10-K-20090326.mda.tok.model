following an initial investment in a portfolio company  the corporation may be requested to make follow on investments in the company 
follow on investments may be made to take advantage of warrants or other preferential rights granted to the corporation or otherwise to increase or maintain the corporation s position in a promising portfolio company 
the corporation may also be called upon to provide an additional investment to a portfolio company in order for that company to fully implement its business plans  to develop a new line of business or to recover from unexpected business problems 
follow on investments in a portfolio company are evaluated individually and may be subject to regulatory restrictions

highlights and outlook the corporation s net asset value increased  or during  closing the year at per share up from at december  at december   the corporation s total investment portfolio was valued at million  which exceeds its cost basis of million  reflecting million in net unrealized appreciation

table of contents the cash balance at december  was million which was approximately million lower than at the end of the corporation was unable to draw the remaining million of outstanding leverage available from the small business administration sba  due to rand sbic s excess cash position  and the leverage expired in september given that the corporation has used up much of its available sba leverage  in order for the corporation to raise substantial amounts of capital in the short term  it will need to rely on rand s ability to sell additional shares of its common stock through public or private offerings 
although rand currently has no specific plans concerning the timing or amount of any common stock offering it might make  it is considering the possibility of making an offering at some time in the next year in order to have more capital available with which to pursue favorable investment opportunities 
see liquidity and capital resources  below 
while the business of some of our portfolio companies is strengthening  in terms of employee growth  increase in revenue  and strengthening net income position  it remains difficult to forecast when future exits will happen  or if the portfolio companies will have sufficient capital to remain viable while their respective markets mature 
critical accounting policies the corporation prepares its financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
for a summary of all significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require the corporation to closely monitor its accounting policies and procedures 
the corporation has identified two critical accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance your ability to assess the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments the most important estimate inherent in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of its investments and the resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the management of the corporation and submitted to the board of directors for approval 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for investments 
the corporation analyzes and values each investment on a quarterly basis  and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  the corporation will record unrealized appreciation if it believes that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  its equity security has also appreciated in value 
these estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
on january   the corporation adopted sfas sfas no 
classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  used in the corporation s valuation at the measurement date 

table of contents level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value 
most of the corporation s investments are classified in level due to their privately held restricted nature 
in the valuation process  the corporation uses financial information received monthly  quarterly  and annually from its portfolio companies  which includes both audited and unaudited financial statements  annual projections and budgets prepared by the portfolio company and other financial and non financial business information supplied by the portfolio companies management 
this information is used to determine financial condition  performance  and valuation of the portfolio investments 
the valuation may be reduced if a company s performance and potential have significantly deteriorated 
if the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome  the valuation may be restored 
another key factor used in valuing equity investments is recent arms length equity transactions with unrelated new investors entered into by the portfolio company that the corporation utilizes to form a basis for its underlying value 
many times the terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the corporation  and the impact of the discrepancy in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net increase in unrealized appreciation 
revenue recognition interest income interest income generally is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt 
in such cases  interest is recognized at the time of receipt 
a reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate 
certain investments of the corporation are structured to provide a deferred interest period when interest is not currently due 
rand sbic s interest accrual is also regulated by the sba s accounting standards and financial reporting requirements for small business investment companies 
under these rules interest income cannot be recognized if collection is doubtful  and a reserve must be established 
the collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company s ability to continue as a going concern or the loan is in default more than days 
management also utilizes other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the corporation adopted the enhanced disclosure provisions of sfas during management does not believe that any other recently issued  but not yet effective  accounting standards  if currently adopted  would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements

therefore  the corporation invests in a mixture of debenture and equity instruments  which will provide a current return on a portion of the investment portfolio 
the equity features contained in our investment portfolio are structured to realize capital appreciation over the long term and may not generate current income in the form of dividends or interest

this requires an allocation of a portion of the investment cost to the warrant and reduces the debt instrument by an equal amount in the form of a note discount or oid 
the note is then reported net of the discount and the discount is accreted into income over the life of the debenture instrument 
table of contents these aforementioned decreases in the current year portfolio interest income are offset by several revenue items that increased portfolio income

the unamortized fees are carried on the balance sheet under deferred revenue 
in addition  other income includes fees charged by the corporation to its portfolio companies for attendance at the portfolio companies board meetings

liquidity and capital resources the corporation s principal objective is to achieve capital appreciation 
therefore  a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential for capital appreciation and certain of the corporation s portfolio investments may be structured to provide little or no current yield in the form of dividends or interest payments 
as of december   the corporation s total liquidity  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  was  net cash used in operating activities has averaged approximately  over the last three years and management anticipates cash will continue to be utilized at similar levels

therefore  the debt and equity markets in the united states have been affected by this crisis 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate  the corporation may suffer losses on its investment portfolio  which could impact cash receipts over the next couple of years 
the unfavorable change in credit market conditions also has created opportunities for capital providers  like the corporation  because small business are selling for lower prices  and they are generally willing to pay higher interest rates and to accept more contractual terms that are more favorable to us in their investment agreements 
accordingly  for firms that continue to have access to capital  management believes that the current environment could provide investment opportunities on more favorable terms than have been available in prior periods 
because the corporation has used its available sba leverage  in the short term  if the corporation requires significant additional capital to take advantage of current investment opportunities  it will need to rely primarily on its ability to make public or private offerings of rand s common stock 
although the corporation currently has no specific plans as to the timing or amount of any common stock offering it might make  it is considering the possibility of making such an offering during the next year in order to raise additional capital to pursue favorable investment opportunities
