critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider the following critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make the most significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
net revenue we derive a significant portion of our revenue from medicare  various state medicaid programs and managed care health plans 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
for medicare and medicaid  provisions for contractual adjustments are made to reduce patient charges to the estimated cash receipts based upon each program s principles of payment reimbursement ie  either prospectively determined or retrospectively determined costs 
final settlements under these programs are subject to administrative review and audit and  accordingly  we periodically provide reserves for the adjustments that may ultimately result therefrom 
estimates for contractual allowances under managed care health plans are primarily based on the payment terms of contractual arrangements  such as predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or discounted fee for service rates 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to ensure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
in the ordinary course of business  we provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for their care 
accounts characterized as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net revenue 
prior to january   our policy and practice was to forego collection of a patient s entire account balance upon determining that the patient qualified under a hospital s local charity care and or indigent policy 
commencing january   we implemented a uniform policy whereby patient account balances are characterized as charity and indigent care only if the patient meets certain percentages of the federal poverty level guidelines 
local hospital personnel and our collection agencies pursue payments on accounts receivable from patients who do not meet such criteria 
we monitor the levels of charity and indigent care provided by our hospitals and the procedures employed to identify and account for those patients 

table of contents provision for doubtful accounts our hospitals provide services to patients with health care coverage  as well as to those without health care coverage 
those patients with health care coverage are often responsible for a portion of their bill referred to as the co payment or deductible 
this portion is determined by the patient s specific health care or insurance plan 
patients without health care coverage are evaluated at the time of service  or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based on federal and state poverty guidelines  qualification for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as our policies for indigent and charity care 
after payment  if any  is received from a third party  statements are sent to patients indicating the outstanding balances on their accounts 
if an account is still outstanding after a period of time  it is referred to a primary collection agency for assistance in collecting the amount due 
the primary collection agency begins the process of debt collection by contacting the patient via mail and phone 
the accounts that are sent to these agencies are often difficult to collect and require more focused  dedicated attention than might be available in a hospital s business office 
we believe that the primary collection agencies have been very successful in collecting the accounts that we send to them 
a secondary collection agency is utilized when accounts are returned from the primary collection agency as uncollectible 
these accounts are written off as uncollectible shortly after they are returned from the primary collection agency 
in certain circumstances  we may sell a portfolio of outstanding accounts receivable to an unrelated third party 
an account is typically sent to the primary collection agency automatically via electronic transfer of data at the end of the statement cycle although  if deemed necessary or appropriate  the account can be sent to the primary collection agency at any time 
accounts that are identified as self pay accounts with balances less than are automatically written off on the th day of each month 
all accounts that have been placed with a primary collection agency that are less than are also written off 
we closely monitor our cash collection trends and the aging of our accounts receivable 
based on our observations  we periodically adjust our accounting policies and estimates 
as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  we modified our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy for self pay patients during each of the years ended december  and after implementing a new revenue discounting policy in february  discounted self pay accounts receivable were initially reserved at 
however  as a result of i a subsequent cash collection analysis that evaluated the adequacy of such self pay reserve policy modification and ii continued deterioration in our self pay accounts receivable  we concluded that it was necessary to reserve a greater portion of self pay accounts receivable 
accordingly  effective june   we revised our policy for self pay patients to increase our reserves for those accounts that are aged less than days from the date that the services were rendered 
we believe that this policy change regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts for self pay accounts receivable appropriately addresses our risk of collection pertaining to the related accounts receivable 
over the past several years  we have not experienced similar adverse trends with respect to our other payors such as medicare  medicaid and managed care health plans 
our recent accounting policy modifications for self pay patients were based on  among other things  our self pay patient cash collection rates and significant increases in uninsured and underinsured patient volume that have been experienced by us and the hospital industry as a whole 
although we believe that our existing policy is appropriate and responsive to the current health care environment and the overall economic climate  we will continue to monitor these circumstances and related industry trends 
changes in payor mix  general economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could have a material adverse effect on our accounts receivable collections  cash flows and results of operations and could result in additional accounting policy modifications in the future 
of the accounts receivable identified as due from third party payors at the time of billing  a small percentage may convert to self pay upon denials from third party payors 
those accounts are closely monitored on a routine basis for potential denial and are reclassified as appropriate 
third party payor and self pay balances  as a percent of total gross billed accounts receivable  are summarized in the tables on the following page 

table of contents december  days days days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals december  days days days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals accounts receivable are reserved at increasing percentages as they age 
all accounts are reserved when they age days from the date of discharge 
in addition to days sales outstanding  which is discussed below under liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures  we utilize other factors to analyze the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
in that regard  we compare subsequent cash collections to net accounts receivable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also review the provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percent of gross accounts receivable 
these and other factors are reviewed monthly and are closely monitored for developing trends in our accounts receivable portfolio 
impairments of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the determination of possible impairment of assets to be held and used is predicated on our estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
long lived assets to be disposed of  including discontinued operations  are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
during the year ended december   we recognized a long lived asset impairment charge in continuing operations of approximately million related to the termination of a capital project 
during the year ended december   we recognized a long lived asset impairment charge in continuing operations of million pertaining to a then pending sale of a hospital that we ultimately retained 
there were no long lived asset impairment charges that were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations during the year ended december  goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever circumstances indicate that a possible impairment might exist 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on  among other things  market conditions and operational performance 
when performing the impairment test  we initially compare the estimated fair values of each reporting unit s net assets  including allocated corporate net assets  to the corresponding carrying amounts on our consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units have historically been determined using a market approach methodology based on net revenue multiples 
during  we also considered a valuation methodology using discounted cash flows and a market approach valuation methodology based on comparable transactions 
if the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets is less than the balance sheet carrying amount  we determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  compare such fair value to the corresponding carrying amount and  if necessary  record a goodwill impairment charge 
there were no goodwill impairment charges in continuing operations during the years ended december   and 
table of contents we base our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but are ultimately unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
additionally  we make certain judgments and assumptions when allocating corporate assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of our reporting units 
changes in the estimates used to conduct goodwill impairment tests  including revenue and profitability projections and market values  could indicate that our goodwill is impaired in future periods and result in a write off of some or all of our goodwill at that time 
reporting units are one level below the operating segment level see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 
however  after consideration of sfas no 
s aggregation rules  we determined that our goodwill impairment testing should be performed at a divisional operating level 
goodwill is discretely allocated to our reporting units ie  each hospital s goodwill is included as a component of the aggregate reporting unit goodwill being evaluated during the impairment analysis 
as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we recognized long lived asset and goodwill impairment charges of million and million in discontinued operations during the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no such charges during the year ended december  income taxes we make estimates to record the provision for income taxes  including conclusions regarding deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  as well as valuation allowances that might be required to offset deferred tax assets 
we estimate valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
when establishing valuation allowances  we consider all relevant information  including ongoing tax planning strategies 
we believe that  other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  future taxable income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets and  therefore  we have not recorded any significant valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
we operate in multiple states with differing tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of our tax filings 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through the period ended december  and resulted in no material audit adjustments 
our federal income tax returns for the tax years ended december  and are currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
we make estimates to record tax reserves that we believe adequately provide for audit adjustments  if any 
during june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
among other things  fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity s financial statements 
fin requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if  as of the balance sheet reporting date  it is more likely than not ie  more than a likelihood that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits 
when making this assessment  management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information 
we adopted fin with an effective date of january  retrospective application of fin was prohibited 
in accordance with the transitional provisions of fin  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings by approximately million on january  professional liability risks commencing october   we began using our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  which is domiciled in the cayman islands  to self insure a significant portion of our professional liability risks 
since its inception  our captive insurance subsidiary has provided claims made coverage to all of our hospitals and a limited number of our employed physicians 
to mitigate its exposure to large claims  our captive insurance subsidiary purchases claims made reinsurance policies for professional liability risks above certain self retention levels 
prior to march   substantially all of our employed physicians were covered under claims made policies with unrelated third party insurance companies 
when a physician terminated employment with us  tail insurance was customarily purchased for the portion of employed service that was previously covered under a claims made policy 
effective march   we began providing occurrence basis insurance policies to most of our employed physicians through a wholly owned risk retention group subsidiary that is domiciled in south carolina 

table of contents our reserves for self insured professional liability claims and related expenses are determined using actuarially based techniques and methodologies 
the data used to develop such reserves is based on asserted and unasserted claim information that has been accumulated by our incident reporting system  historical loss payment patterns and industry trends 
we discounted these long term liabilities to their estimated present values using discount rates of and at december  and  respectively 
we select a discount rate that represents the risk free interest rate correlating to the period when the claims are projected to be paid 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our professional liability reserve requirements by approximately million 
the discounted reserves are periodically reviewed and adjustments thereto are recorded as more information about claim trends becomes known to us 
although the ultimate settlement of these liabilities may vary from our estimates  we believe that the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are adequate and reasonable 
however  if actual losses and loss expenses exceed our projections of claim activity  our reserves could be materially adversely affected 
other self insured programs we provide income continuance to and reimburse certain health care costs of our disabled employees collectively  workers compensation and we provide health and welfare benefits to our employees  their spouses and certain beneficiaries 
such employee benefit programs are primarily self insured 
we record estimated liabilities for both reported and incurred but not reported workers compensation and health and welfare claims based on historical loss experience and other information provided by our third party administrators 
the long term liabilities for our workers compensation program are determined using actuarially based techniques and methodologies and are discounted to their estimated present values 
we select a discount rate that represents the risk free interest rate correlating to the period when such benefits are projected to be paid 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our workers compensation liabilities by approximately million 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that the liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements for these self insured programs are adequate and reasonable 
if the actual costs of these programs exceed our estimates  the liabilities could be materially adversely affected 
legal and other loss contingencies we regularly review the status of our legal matters and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a reserve 
significant judgment is required when determining probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
predicting the final outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating financial exposure involves substantial uncertainties and  therefore  actual costs may vary materially from our estimates 
when making determinations of likely outcomes of legal matters and the related financial exposure  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the nature of the claim including unasserted claims  the availability of insurance  our experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction where the matter is disputed  input from legal counsel  the likelihood of resolution through alternative dispute resolution or other means and the current status of the matter 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and we may revise and adjust our estimates at that time 
adjustments to reserves reflect the status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel and other relevant information 
changes in our estimates of the financial exposure for legal matters and other loss contingencies could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our material legal matters and loss contingencies 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements during september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which  among other things  established a framework for measuring fair value and required supplemental disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes resulting from the application of this new accounting pronouncement primarily relate to the definition of fair value and the methods used to measure fair value 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within the year of adoption 
however  the fasb subsequently deferred sfas no 
for one year insofar as it relates to certain non financial assets and liabilities 

table of contents we adopted sfas no 
on january   except for the provisions relating to non financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
the adoption of sfas no 
for our financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
non financial assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of sfas no 
include i those items measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing  ii tangible and intangible long lived assets measured at fair value for impairment testing  and iii those items initially measured at fair value in a business combination 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
on january  as it relates to our non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed on a non recurring basis 
business combinations and noncontrolling interests during december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  sfas no 
r and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
these accounting pronouncements are required to be adopted simultaneously and are effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   as well as interim periods within the year of adoption 
early adoption of these new accounting pronouncements was prohibited 
among other things  sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize i all and only assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of acquired businesses  ii contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values subsequent changes in fair value are generally reflected in earnings  and iii acquisition related transaction costs as expense when incurred 
additionally  sfas no 
r establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
disclosure of the information necessary to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effects of a business combination must also be provided 
among other things  sfas no 
requires entities to report i noncontrolling minority interests as equity in their consolidated financial statements  ii earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense  and iii attribution of losses to noncontrolling interests  even if those losses exceed the noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary 
sfas no 
also provides guidance for deconsolidation and noncontrolling interest acquisition disposition transactions that differs significantly from past accounting practice 
we adopted sfas no 
r and sfas no 
on january  the adoption of these accounting standards did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  however  the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included with our quarterly report on form q for the three months ending march  will be modified to conform to the requirements set forth in sfas no 
convertible debt instruments on may   the fasb issued staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  which  among other things  requires issuers of certain convertible debt instruments to separately account for the liability and equity components thereof and reflect interest expense at the entity s market rate of borrowing for non convertible debt instruments 
apb also requires retrospective restatement of all periods presented with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on periods prior to those presented being recognized as of the beginning of the first period presented 
apb s effective date is the first reporting period beginning after december   including interim periods within the year of adoption 
early adoption of apb was prohibited 
we adopted this new accounting standard on january   however  we continue to evaluate the transition date election for the earliest periods presented 
for the year ending december   we estimate that increased interest expense related to apb will adversely impact our diluted earnings per share by approximately 
additionally  our gains on the early extinguishment of debt will be significantly reduced during as a result of the provisions of apb see note b to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding repurchases of certain of our convertible debt securities subsequent to december  
the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included with our quarterly report on form q for the three months ending march  will restate prior periods for the effects of apb 
table of contents international financial reporting standards ifrs ifrs is a set of standards and related interpretations that have been adopted by the international accounting standards board to provide a comprehensive framework for accounting and financial reporting 
the securities and exchange commission the sec recently proposed a long term transition plan that would ultimately require domestic registrants to convert from us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to ifrs 
the sec s primary objective is for domestic registrants to provide financial statements using a single set of high quality  globally accepted accounting and financial reporting standards  which would align the financial statements of domestic registrants with those already provided by public companies in many other countries 
enhanced financial statement comparability could i facilitate access by domestic registrants to overseas capital markets  investments  acquisitions  joint ventures and other strategic transactions  ii reduce a registrant s cost of capital  and iii reduce systems integration costs 
based on the sec s proposed transition plan  we will not be required to adopt ifrs earlier than the filing of our annual report on form k for the year ending december   however  we will be required to retrospectively restate all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements of that form k with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recognized as of january  due to the complex analyses necessary to compare gaap to ifrs  we have not yet determined the impact of the sec s recently proposed ifrs transition plan on our consolidated financial statements if such plan is adopted in its current form 
results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in item on december   we operated hospitals with a total of  licensed beds in non urban communities in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  kentucky  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  washington and west virginia 
during september  we made certain changes and additions to our senior executive management team 
effective september   gary d 
newsome was appointed to our board of directors and named president and chief executive officer  succeeding burke w 
whitman 
mr 
whitman resigned as an officer  director and employee of our company on september  additionally  kelly e 
curry was appointed as our executive vice president and chief administrative officer effective september  mr 
curry had previously served as our executive vice president and chief operating officer since july  unless specifically indicated otherwise  the following discussion excludes our discontinued operations  which are identified at note to the consolidated financial statements in item other than i long lived asset and goodwill impairment charges of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  ii gains of million and million from the dispositions of businesses and assets during the years ended december  and  respectively  and iii a charge of million for the estimated cost of partially subsidizing certain third party physician practice losses during the year ended december   such discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations during the years presented herein 
during the year ended december   which we refer to as the calendar year  we experienced net revenue growth over the year ended december   which we refer to as the calendar year  of approximately 
such growth primarily resulted from increases in emergency room visits and reimbursement rates and favorable case mix trends 
income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased approximately million and  respectively  during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year 
these increases were due to i a gain of approximately million on the sale of a minority equity interest in our seven general acute care hospitals in north carolina and south carolina  ii a net gain of million on sales dispositions of certain of our health care business units and other assets  and iii a net gain of million on repurchases of certain of our convertible debt securities 
excluding such gains  our income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased approximately million and  respectively  when compared to the calendar year 
the 
table of contents primary factors causing this year over year decrease in profitability were i increased interest costs  ii higher costs for salaries and benefits  iii an increase in depreciation and amortization expense  iv additional minority interests in the earnings of consolidated entities  and v a calendar year other than temporary impairment charge for available for sale securities of million 
partially offsetting these items was a reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts during the calendar year as a result of lower uninsured and underinsured patient volume 
in light of the downturn in the domestic economy  turbulence in the worldwide credit markets and uncertainties about economic conditions in and beyond  we recently implemented several company wide cost containment measures 
the initiatives that we undertook were designed to position our company to remain profitable and strategically flexible while continually providing the highest level of patient care 
among other things  the cost containment measures that we have implemented to date include staff reductions  postponements of merit pay increases  new hire limitations and modifications to certain employee benefit plans 
there can be no assurances that our actions will adequately address a severe or prolonged domestic recession and or other economic headwinds that we may face 
at our hospitals that were in operation during the entirety of the calendar year and the calendar year  which we refer to as same hospitals  emergency room visits increased approximately  however  corresponding same hospital admissions and surgical volume declined by and  respectively 
these declines were partially attributable to lower uninsured patient volume during the calendar year  the current downturn in the national economy and certain operational disruptions experienced during the transition of our north carolina and south carolina hospitals to a multi hospital joint venture arrangement 
we have implemented corrective action plans at certain hospitals to address unfavorable operating trends  including  among other things  hiring new management teams  modifying physician employment agreements  renegotiating payor contracts and initiating patient  physician and employee satisfaction surveys 
in this regard  our prime objective is to stabilize operations in the areas of patient volume  operating margins  uninsured underinsured patient levels and the provision for doubtful accounts 
secondarily  we seek opportunities for market development in the communities that our hospitals serve 
furthermore  we continue to invest significant resources in physician recruitment and retention  emergency room operations and capital projects at our hospitals 
we believe that our strategic initiatives will enhance patient  physician and employee satisfaction  improve clinical outcomes and ultimately yield increased surgical volume  emergency room visits and admissions 
we have also taken the steps that we believe are necessary to achieve industry leadership in clinical quality 
our vision is that over the next two to three years we will be the highest rated health care provider of any hospital system in the country  as measured by medicare 
with new clinical affairs leaders to support this critical quality initiative  we are now measuring the appropriate performance objectives  increasing accountability for achieving those objectives and recognizing the leaders whose quality indicators and clinical outcomes demonstrate improvement 
outpatient services continue to play an important role in the delivery of health care in our markets  with approximately half of our net revenue during the calendar year and the calendar year generated on an outpatient basis 
recognizing the importance of these services  we have improved our health care facilities to meet the outpatient needs of the communities that they serve 
we have also invested substantial capital in our hospitals and clinics during the past several years  resulting in improvements and enhancements to our diagnostic imaging and ambulatory surgical services 
notwithstanding this continuous operational focus  our same hospital adjusted admissions  which adjusts admissions for outpatient volume  decreased approximately during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year 
we believe that the factors that caused declines in our surgical volume and hospital admissions also contributed to our adjusted admissions decline 
economic conditions and changes in commercial health insurance benefit plans over the past several years have contributed to an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients seeking health care in the united states 
although this general industry trend has affected us  our same hospital self pay admissions as a percent of total admissions declined from approximately during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
there can be no assurances that this favorable self pay admissions trend will continue 
we regularly evaluate our self pay policies and programs and consider changes or modifications as circumstances warrant

table of contents net revenue during the calendar year was approximately  million as compared to  million during the calendar year 
this change represented an increase of million or 
same hospitals provided approximately million  or  of the growth in net revenue as a result of increases in emergency room visits and reimbursement rates and favorable case mix trends 
the remaining million increase was primarily attributable to physicians regional medical center collier boulevard  our de novo general acute care hospital that opened on february  net revenue per adjusted admission at our same hospitals increased approximately during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year 
the factors contributing to such change included increased patient acuity and the favorable effects of renegotiated agreements with certain commercial health insurance providers 
our provision for doubtful accounts during the calendar year declined basis points to of net revenue as compared to of net revenue during the calendar year 
as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  we modified our provision for doubtful accounts policy for self pay accounts receivable during the calendar year  resulting in the recognition of incremental expense of approximately million 
excluding the impact of such change in estimate  we experienced an increase of approximately basis points in the calendar year provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net revenue 
such increase was primarily due to a reduction in the calendar year provision for doubtful accounts of million from the recovery of certain accounts receivable that were previously written off such recovery did not recur during the calendar year in a similar amount 
our consistently applied accounting policy is that accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net revenue and  accordingly  such amounts have no impact on our provision for doubtful accounts 
however  as a measure of our fiscal performance  we routinely aggregate amounts pertaining to our i provision for doubtful accounts  ii uninsured self pay patient discounts and iii foregone unrecognized revenue for charity and indigent care and then we divide the resulting total by the sum of our i net revenue  ii uninsured self pay patient discounts and iii foregone unrecognized revenue for charity and indigent care 
we believe that this fiscal measure  which we refer to as our uncompensated patient care percentage  is important because it provides us with key information regarding the aggregate level of patient care for which we do not receive remuneration 
our uncompensated patient care percentage was determined to be during the calendar year 
as a result of the allowance for doubtful accounts policy modifications discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  the uncompensated patient care percentage for the calendar year is more readily comparable to the six months ended december   which was 
the drop in our uncompensated patient care percentage during the calendar year reflects  among other things  declining uninsured and underinsured patient volume  partially offset by the impact of the abovementioned calendar year accounts receivable recovery that did not recur during the calendar year in a similar amount 
salaries and benefits as a percent of net revenue increased to during the calendar year from during the calendar year 
same hospital salaries and benefits increased from of net revenue during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
these increases were primarily due to higher employed physician costs  routine salary and wage increases and growth in employee health benefit costs 
additionally  nursing personnel costs increased during the calendar year as a result of implementing certain aspects of our clinical quality initiatives 
depreciation and amortization as a percent of net revenue increased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
this increase primarily resulted from calendar year capital expenditures for renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and our de novo hospital construction 
additionally  the intangible assets from our physician and physician group guarantees generated approximately million of incremental amortization expense during the calendar year 
included in gains on sales of assets during the calendar year were i a gain of approximately million on the sale of a minority equity interest and ii a net gain of million on the sales dispositions of three home health agencies  two nursing homes  a health care billing operation and other assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding these transactions and other related matters 

table of contents interest and other income was approximately million and million during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
as more fully discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge for available for sale securities of million during the calendar year 
there was no such charge during the calendar year 
interest expense increased from approximately million during the calendar year to million during the calendar year 
such increase was primarily due to i our billion seven year term loan being outstanding for the entire calendar year but only ten months of the calendar year and ii incremental interest expense from our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes that we sold on may  the calendar year was favorably impacted by reduced interest cost on our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes  substantially all of which were repurchased during the calendar year 
see liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our long term debt arrangements 
during the calendar year  we repurchased certain of the notes and the notes  yielding a net gain of approximately million 
see liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures below and note b to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our convertible debt securities

such accounting policy modifications contributed approximately basis points and basis points to the calendar year and the calendar year percentages  respectively 
excluding the impact of such accounting policy modifications  we experienced an increase of basis points in the calendar year provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net revenue

salaries and benefits as a percent of net revenue increased to during the calendar year from during the calendar year

no such amount was recognized during the calendar year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our insurance claim activity 
interest expense increased from approximately million during the calendar year to million during the calendar year

calendar year cash flows compared to the calendar year cash flows operating activities our cash flows from continuing operating activities decreased approximately million  or  during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year 
the decrease primarily related to i lower pre tax income from continuing operations during the calendar year compared to the calendar year principally due to a significant increase in interest expense from new indebtedness incurred in connection with the recapitalization of our balance sheet on march   ii growth in our accounts receivable during the calendar year  and iii unfavorable year over year changes in the timing of payments for income taxes  accrued expenses and other liabilities

days sales outstanding days sales outstanding  or dso  is calculated by dividing quarterly net revenue by the number of days in the quarter 
the result is divided into the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter to obtain our dso 
we believe that this statistic is an important measure of collections on our accounts receivable  as well as our liquidity 
our dso was days at december   which compares favorably to days at september  and days at december  
table of contents income taxes other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  we believe that it is more likely than not that carrybacks  reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income will allow us to realize the deferred tax assets that are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
effect of legislative and regulatory action on liquidity the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs are subject to change as a result of legislative and regulatory actions 
although we believe that changes will continue to limit reimbursement increases under those programs  we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our future revenue or liquidity 
nevertheless  within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  numerous areas are subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion that could affect payments made to us 
in the future  federal and or state governments might i reduce the funds available under those programs in order to close budget gaps or reduce deficit spending or ii require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
additionally  any future restructuring of the financing and delivery of health care services in the united states and or the continued prevalence of managed care health plans could have an adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
capital resources sales of assets and related activities in addition to our current initiatives to increase patient volume and operating profit  our plans to enhance cash flow during and beyond may also include sales of i hospitals and other health care business units that no longer meet our long term strategic objectives  ii certain hospital assets  and iii the residual assets of our discontinued operations 
additionally  we are currently considering joint venture opportunities at several of our hospitals to supplement our cash flow 
these potential transactions are collectively referred to herein as our strategic transactions 
as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we completed certain strategic transactions during the calendar year 
there can be no assurances that we will successfully initiate and complete any additional strategic transactions on satisfactory terms  if at all  or that any future strategic transactions will not cause us to recognize a loss in our consolidated financial statements 
credit facilities senior secured credit facilities 
on march   we completed a recapitalization of our balance sheet the recapitalization wherein we entered into agreements for billion in new variable rate senior secured credit facilities the credit facilities 
the credit facilities were initially used to fund a special cash dividend of approximately billion and repay all amounts outstanding under our predecessor revolving credit agreement ie  million 
the credit facilities consist of a seven year billion term loan the term loan and a million six year revolving credit facility the revolving credit agreement 
the recapitalization and the credit facilities are discussed in further detail at note to the consolidated financial statements in item the term loan requires i quarterly principal payments to amortize approximately of the loan s face value during each year of the loan s term and ii a balloon payment for the remaining outstanding loan balance at the termination of the agreement 
we are also required to repay principal under the term loan in an amount that can be as much as of our annual excess cash flow  as such term is defined in the loan agreement 
the annual excess cash flow generated during the year ended december  that we repaid during the calendar year was approximately million 
we also prepaid million of principal under the term loan during the calendar year 
our mandatory principal payments under the credit facilities for the year ending december   including the annual excess cash flow payment  will be approximately million 
during the revolving credit agreement s six year term  we are obligated to pay commitment fees based on the amounts available for borrowing 
additionally  the revolving credit agreement has a million standby letter of credit limit 
amounts outstanding under the credit facilities may be repaid at our option at any time  in whole or in part  without penalty 

table of contents we can elect whether interest on the credit facilities  which is generally payable quarterly in arrears  is calculated using libor or prime as its base rate 
the effective interest rate includes a spread above our selected base rate and is subject to modification in certain circumstances 
additionally  we may elect differing base interest rates for the term loan and the revolving credit agreement 
during  as required by the agreements underlying the credit facilities  we entered into a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap contract that provides for us to pay a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount of such contract for the seven year term of the term loan 
notwithstanding this contractual arrangement  we remain ultimately responsible for all amounts due and payable under the term loan 
therefore  we are exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by one or more of the counterparties to the interest rate swap contract 
see note s to the consolidated financial statements in item regarding the estimated fair values of our interest rate swap contract 
at december   million of the term loan was not covered by the interest rate swap contract and  accordingly  such amount was subject to the credit facilities variable interest rate provisions ie  an effective interest rate of approximately on both december  and february  
although there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement on february   standby letters of credit in favor of third parties of approximately million reduced the amount available for borrowing thereunder to million on such date 
our effective interest rate on the variable rate revolving credit agreement was approximately on february  we intend to fund the term loan s quarterly interest payments  required annual principal payments and mandatory annual excess cash flow payments with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  cash proceeds from our strategic transactions and or borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
demand promissory note 
we maintain a million unsecured demand promissory note in favor of a bank for use as a working capital line of credit in conjunction with our cash management program 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the demand promissory note  we may borrow and repay  on a revolving basis  up to the principal face amount of the note 
all principal and accrued interest will be immediately due and payable upon the bank s written demand 
absent such a demand  interest is payable monthly and determined using the libor market index rate  as that term is defined in the demand promissory note  plus 
the demand promissory note s effective interest rate on february  was approximately  however  there were no amounts outstanding thereunder on such date 
convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes as more fully discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  on may  we completed a private placement of million of notes  which are unsecured obligations that are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
after transaction related costs  the sale of the notes resulted in our receipt of net proceeds of approximately million  which we used to repurchase certain of our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes in the open market 
the notes mature on may  and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on may and november during december and early  we used cash on hand to repurchase million of principal face amount notes in the open market at approximately of their principal face value  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
should market conditions continue to be advantageous to us  we intend to repurchase additional notes in the open market during any such note repurchases and the interest payments on the remaining note outstanding principal balance of million will be funded with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and or borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
debt covenants the credit facilities and the indentures governing the notes  the notes and our senior notes due contain covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in those debt agreements 
specifically  the table below summarizes what we believe are the key financial covenants under the credit facilities and our corresponding actual fiscal performance as of and for the year ended december  requirement actual minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio to to maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio to to 
table of contents although there can be no assurances  we believe that we will continue to comply with all of our debt covenants 
should we fail to comply with one or more of our debt covenants in the future and are unable to remedy the matter  an event of default may result 
in that circumstance  we would seek a waiver from our lenders or renegotiate the related debt agreement  however  such renegotiations could subject us to higher interest and financing costs on our debt obligations 
dividends as part of the recapitalization  our board of directors declared a special cash dividend  payable on march   of per share of common stock  or approximately billion in the aggregate 
in light of the special cash dividend  we indefinitely suspended all future dividend payments 
additionally  the credit facilities restrict our ability to pay cash dividends 
standby letters of credit on february   we maintained approximately million of standby letters of credit in favor of third parties with various expiration dates through january  should any or all of these letters of credit be drawn upon  we intend to satisfy such obligations with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and  if necessary  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures we believe that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment will range from to of our net revenue during the year ending december  although our long term business strategy may call for us to acquire hospitals that meet our acquisition criteria  we do not currently anticipate any material acquisitions through december  unless a hospital that we believe is strategic to our business plan becomes available at a reasonable price 
historically  acquisitions of hospitals accounted for a significant portion of our capital expenditures in any given fiscal year and or quarter 
we generally fund acquisitions  replacement hospital construction and other recurring capital expenditures with available cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  amounts available under revolving credit agreements and proceeds from long term debt issuances  or a combination thereof 
a number of hospital renovation and expansion projects were underway on december  at our monroe  georgia location  we began site preparation work for a replacement hospital during the calendar year 
we estimate that the cost of this replacement hospital  which we are contractually obligated to build  will range from million to million over the multi year construction period 
we do not believe that any of our hospital renovation and expansion projects are individually significant or that they represent  in the aggregate  a material commitment of our resources 
hospital divestitures and other as more fully discussed at note to our consolidated financial statements in item  we intend to divest i gulf coast medical center  formerly a general acute care hospital in biloxi  mississippi that we closed on january  and ii the woman s center at dallas regional medical center  formerly a specialty women s hospital in mesquite  texas that we closed on june  however  the timing of such divestitures has not yet been determined 
we intend to use the proceeds from these divestitures and other strategic transactions that we may consummate for general corporate purposes and debt reduction 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements except as set forth in the table on the following page  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we had approximately million recorded as a liability for our interest rate swap contract and million recorded as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties 
we excluded these amounts from the table below due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be paid  if any  as well as the timing of such payments 

table of contents as of december   contractual obligations for each of the next five years ending december and thereafter including principal and interest and other commitments are summarized in the table below 
interest rates at december  were used in the table to estimate interest payments on variable rate debt 
payments due by year ending december  thereafter contractual obligations in thousands long term debt a capital leases operating leases b physician commitments c total contractual obligations commitment expiration by year ending december  other commitments not recorded thereafter on our consolidated balance sheet in thousands letters of credit d physician commitments c other e total commitments a subsequent to december   we repurchased million of principal face amount notes in the open market at approximately of their principal face amount 
therefore  we included the amount we paid for those notes under the year ending december  we also assumed that we would repurchase the remaining notes on august  because the noteholders can unilaterally exercise their contractual rights to require us to repurchase some or all of their notes on such date 
b amounts relate to obligations under operating leases for real property  real property master leases and equipment 
the real property master leases are leases for buildings near our hospitals for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income to the owners of the property 
we sublease space in these buildings to unrelated third parties 
future operating lease obligations are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
c see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding physician and physician group guarantees and commitments 
d amount relates to outstanding letters of credit that principally serve as security for our workers compensation self insurance program and utility companies 
e other includes our replacement hospital construction in monroe  georgia and purchase commitments for supplies 
impact of seasonality and inflation seasonality we typically experience higher patient volume and net revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which in turn increases the number of patients we treat during those months 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive and subject to wage and related employee benefit expense increases  especially during periods of inflation and when there exists a shortage of skilled labor 
an ongoing skilled nursing staff shortage throughout the health care industry has caused nursing salaries to increase 
we have addressed our nursing staff needs by increasing wages  improving hospital working conditions and fostering relationships with local nursing schools 
we do not believe that the inflationary trend in nursing salaries or the nursing shortage will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
suppliers  utility companies and other vendors pass on rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we believe that we have been able to partially offset increases in our operating costs by increasing prices  achieving quantity discounts for purchases through our group purchasing agreement and efficiently utilizing our resources 
although we have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs  we cannot predict our ability to recover or offset future cost increases 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pursuant to the requirements of the agreements underlying the credit facilities  we entered into a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap contract  which provides for us to pay a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount of the interest rate swap contract for the seven year term of the term loan 
because million of the term loan was not covered by our interest rate swap contract on december   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
the interest rates on substantially all of our other long term debt at december  were fixed and  accordingly  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on us but increases in interest rates would correspondingly increase interest expense associated with any future borrowings 
as of december   the fair value and carrying amount of our fixed rate debt  including capital lease obligations  were approximately  million and  million  respectively 
additionally  at such date  both the fair value and carrying amount of our variable rate debt was approximately million
