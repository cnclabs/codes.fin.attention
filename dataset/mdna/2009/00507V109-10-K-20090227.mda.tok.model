integration and reorganization following the business combination on july   we have restructured the vivendi games businesses to capture cost synergies and to streamline the combined activision blizzard organization 
for the first six months of  we expect to continue to incur restructuring expenses mainly relating to severance payments of remaining interim employees who are currently assisting us to exit our non core operations and under utilized facilities 
we anticipate substantially exiting or winding down our non core operations and substantially completing our organizational restructuring activities as a result of the business combination by june for the six months ending june   we anticipate incurring between million and million of additional before tax restructuring charges  and after tax cash restructuring charges 
table of contents between million and million relating to the business combination 
overall  including charges incurred through december   we expect to incur before tax restructuring charges between million and million by june   with an after tax cash impact between million and million 
the after tax charges are expected to consist primarily of employee related severance cash costs approximately million  facility exit cash costs approximately million  and cash contract terminations costs approximately million 
separately  through december   these restructuring charges were partially offset by cash proceeds of approximately million from asset disposals and after tax cash benefits related to the streamlining of the vivendi games title portfolio 
for the next six months  we anticipate between million to million of further cash proceeds to partially offset future restructuring cash charges 
we do not expect these anticipated restructuring expenses to materially effect future earnings and cash flow of activision blizzard 
console online games activision has published games with online functionality that constitutes a more than inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product  and in which our performance obligations extend beyond the sale of the game 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for these online features  as we do not separately charge for this component of these titles 
as a result  we recognize all of the revenue from the sale of these titles ratably over an estimated service period 
in addition  we defer the costs of sales of these titles to match revenue 
mmorpg online games blizzard published the first expansion pack world of warcarft the burning crusade  in january and the second expansion pack  world of warcraft wrath of the lich king in november we expect these expansions will extend blizzard s subscription revenues by retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 
impact of deferred revenues and related cost of sales for the year ended december   the net impact of deferred revenues and related cost of sales decreased consolidated net revenues and total cost of sales by million and million  respectively 
we anticipate  for the year ending december   the net impact of deferred revenues and related cost of sales will decrease consolidated net revenues and total cost of sales by approximately million and million  respectively 
as our major releases are planned in the december quarter of  we expect that a majority of the revenues and related costs of sales will be deferred in the december quarter of  and recognized in however  the actual amount of revenues and cost of sales deferred will vary significantly depending upon the timing of the release of these titles and the sales volume of such products 
other revenues activision is continuing the development of online capabilities for its games 
activision plans to continue to exploit other revenue sources  including downloadable content and in game advertising for its console games 
economic conditions we continue to monitor the recent adverse changes in economic conditions which may have unfavorable impacts on our businesses  such as deteriorating consumer demand  pricing pressure on our products  credit quality of our receivables  and foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting 
table of contents results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers  and once any performance obligations have been completed 
certain products are sold to customers with a street date the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers 
for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date 
revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection 
some of our software products provide limited online features at no additional cost to the consumer 
generally  we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable 
accordingly  we recognize revenue related to products containing these limited online features upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customer 
in instances where online features or additional functionality is considered more than an inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product  we take this into account when applying our revenue recognition policy 
this evaluation is performed for each software product together with any online transactions  such as electronic downloads of titles with product add ons when it is released 
in instances where the online service is considered more than an inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product  we account for the sale as a bundled sale  or multiple element arrangement  in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price 
vendor specific objective evidence for the fair value of the online service does not exist as we do not separately offer or charge for the online service 
therefore  when the online service is determined to be more than an inconsequential deliverable  we recognize the revenue from sales of such software products ratably over the estimated online service period  beginning the month after shipment of the software product 
costs of sales excluding intangible asset amortization classified as costs of sales related to such products are also deferred and recognized with the related revenues  including manufacturing costs  software royalties and amortization and intellectual property licenses 
we consider the world of warcraft boxed product including expansion packs and other ancillary revenues as a single deliverable with the total arrangement consideration combined and recognized ratably as revenue over the estimated product life beginning upon activation of the software and delivery of the services 
revenues attributed to the sale of world of warcraft boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as product sales and revenues attributable to subscription and other ancillary services are classified as subscription  licensing and other revenues 
determining whether the online service for a particular game constitutes more than an inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires management s judgment 
determining the estimated service period over which to recognize the related revenue and costs of sales is also subjective and involves management s judgment 
allowances for returns  price protection  doubtful accounts  and inventory obsolescence 
we may permit product returns from  or grant price protection to  our customers under certain conditions 
in general  price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and  when granted and applicable  allows customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and or future invoices 
the conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection include  among other things  compliance with applicable trading and payment terms  and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell through reports to us 
we may also consider other factors  including the facilitation of slow moving inventory and other market factors 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenue 
we estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenue utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer 
the following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and 
table of contents price protection for a particular title historical performance of titles in similar genres  historical performance of the hardware platform  historical performance of the franchise  console hardware life cycle  sales force and retail customer feedback  industry pricing  weeks of on hand retail channel inventory  absolute quantity of on hand retail channel inventory  our warehouse on hand inventory levels  the title s recent sell through history if available  marketing trade programs  and competing titles 
the relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon  among other items  genre  platform  seasonality  and sales strategy 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period 
based upon historical experience  we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons including  among others  a lack of consumer acceptance of a title  the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor  or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if factors or market conditions change or if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for returns and price protection 
for example  a change in our december  allowance for returns and price protection would impact net revenues by approximately million 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customers payment terms and their economic condition  as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance 
any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management s estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products 
significant changes in demand for our products would impact management s estimates in establishing our inventory provision 
software development costs and intellectual property licenses 
software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements  as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products 
we account for software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  sfas no 

software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable 
technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation  or the completed and tested product design and working model 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established 
for products where proven technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
prior to a product s release  we expense  as part of cost of sales software royalties and amortization  capitalized costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable 
capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation 
amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense 
commencing upon product release  capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product  generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less 
intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks  copyrights  software  technology  music  or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products 
depending upon the agreement with the rights 
table of contents holder  we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in multiple products over multiple years  or alternatively  for a single product 
prior to the related product s release  we expense  as part of cost of sales intellectual property licenses  capitalized intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable 
capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation 
commencing upon the related product s release  capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales intellectual property licenses based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized 
as intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years  the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis 
for products that have been released in prior periods  the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance 
for products that are scheduled to be released in future periods  recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used 
criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology  orders for the product prior to its release  and  for any sequel product  estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based 
further  as many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years  we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors  such as the success of other products and or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property  whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property  and the rights holder s continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs 
in evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs  the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred 
if revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis  the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter  which could result in an impairment charge 
additionally  as noted above  as many of our intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years  we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors such as the success of other products and or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property  whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property and the rights holder s continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors 
income taxes 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
and other complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements 
without an independent market or another representative transaction  determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value 
these include the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value  the income approach  which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount  and the cost approach  which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset 
for many of our fair value estimates  including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets  we use the income approach 
using the income approach requires the use of financial models  which require us to make various estimates including  but not limited to the potential future cash flows for the asset  liability or equity instrument being measured  the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows  the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows  and the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium 
making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective  and  if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached 
for example  a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 
while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions  the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments business combinations 
we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill  which is an asset that is not amortized 
often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset  the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in process technology 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements 
assessment of impairment of assets 
management evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the 
table of contents impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists 
we considered certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable including  but are not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time  and changes in our business strategy 
in determining if an impairment exists  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
if an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the decision to dispose of certain assets of the non core operating segment as part of our restructuring plan following the business combination was considered to be an indicator of impairment under sfas no 
we performed an impairment test on the long lived assets of the non core operating segment and determined that an acquired trade name was impaired 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recorded as part of restructuring costs 
other than this event  during  we did not perform any other impairment tests of our long lived assets as there were no significant and adverse underlying changes to our expected operating results or other indicators of impairment 
other than the million impairment of the acquired trade name  we determined that there was no other impairment of long lived assets for the years ended december   and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles sfas no 
requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit 
our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which both discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
sfas no 
requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a fair value based test 
the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
to determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions 
these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment 
our estimates for market growth  our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors

partially offset by segment operating losses from activision blizzard s non core exit operations  which includes write off of capitalized software development costs totaling million for the year ended december   mainly as a result of the rationalization of our title portfolio  and the higher cost of sales related to the manufacturing and distribution costs of the guitar hero world tour band bundle products 
blizzard s operating income for the year ended december  increased when compared to the year ended december  mainly attributable to the successful release in multiple markets of world of warcraft the burning crusade which had higher operating margins than the typical pc or console release  coupled with the implementation of new cost controls in the areas of sales and

with our liquid investment portfolio and expected cash flows provided by operating activities  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet daily operations in the foreseeable future 
we also believe that we have sufficient working capital approximately billion at december   as well as availability under our credit facilities  to finance our operational requirements for at least the next twelve months  including purchases of inventory and equipment  the funding of the development  production  marketing and sale of new products  to finance the acquisition of intellectual property rights for future products from third parties  the restructuring activities  and to fund the stock repurchase program we announced on november  on november   we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to billion of our common stock 
under this program  we may repurchase our common stock from time to time on the open market or in private transactions  including structured or accelerated transactions 
we will determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued by the company at any time 
we purchased million shares for million in the fourth quarter of  leaving approximately million available for purchases under the program at december  cash flows from operating activities the primary drivers of cash flows from operating activities have typically included the collection of customer receivables generated by the sale of our products and our subscription revenues  offset by 
table of contents payments to vendors for the manufacture  distribution and marketing of our products  third party developers and intellectual property holders and to our employees 
a significant operating use of our cash relates to our continued investment in software development and intellectual property licenses 
we expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures relating to our investment in software development and intellectual property licenses 
our future cash commitments relating to these investments are detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from investing activities the primary drivers of cash flows used in investing activities have typically included capital expenditures  acquisitions of privately held interactive software development companies and publishing companies and the net effect of purchases and sales maturities of investments 
the goal of our investments is to minimize risk and maintain liquidity while maximizing returns  funding anticipated working capital needs  and providing for prudent investment diversification 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by investing activities were primarily the result of the reverse acquisition of activision  inc  partially offset by cash paid for capital expenditures  and the acquisitions of freestyle games  ltd 
and budcat creations  llc 
due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of liquidation of our auction rate securities ars  which are comprised of debt obligations secured by higher education student loans  all our investments in such securities were classified as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheets at december  liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every to days 
on an industry wide basis  many auctions have failed  and there is  as yet  no meaningful secondary market for these instruments 
each of the auction rate securities in our investment portfolio at december  has experienced a failed auction and there is no assurance that future auctions for these securities will succeed 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction  the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to earn interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every to days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
in august  certain affiliates of citigroup  inc citi and ubs through which we own our auction rate securities  announced agreements in principle with various state regulatory agencies and the sec  to address their clients liquidity issues arising from the auction failures 
on august   citi announced that it would use its best efforts to provide liquidity solutions to its institutional investor client who invested in auction rate securities by the end of on november   we accepted an offer from ubs  providing us with rights related to our ars held through ubs the rights 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars held through ubs at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june  through july  conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
if auctions continue to fail  we expect to sell our ars under the rights 
however  if the rights are not exercised before july  they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
so long as we hold our ars  they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process fails 

table of contents ubs s obligations under the rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
the fair value of auction rate securities through ubs and citi totaled million and million  respectively  at december  based on our other available cash and expected operating cash flows and financing  we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
cash flows from financing activities the primary drivers of cash flows provided by financing activities have historically related to transactions involving our common stock  including the issuance of our common stock to employees and the public and the purchase of treasury shares 
we have not utilized debt financing as a significant source of cash flows 
however  if needed  we may access and utilize the credit facilities that are described in credit facilities in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital requirements for the year ending december   we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately million 
capital expenditures will be primarily for computer hardware and software purchases and various corporate projects 
credit facilities we have revolving credit facilities with our centresoft subsidiary located in the uk the uk facility and our nbg subsidiary located in germany the german facility 
the uk facility provides centresoft with the ability to borrow up to million great british pound sterling gbp million  including issuing letters of credit  on a revolving basis at december  the german facility provides for revolving loans up to million euro eur million at december  no borrowings were outstanding against the uk facility or the german facility at december  at december   we maintained a million irrevocable standby letter of credit required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases 
the letter of credit was undrawn at december  at december   our publishing subsidiary located in the uk maintained a eur million million irrevocable standby letter of credit 
the standby letter of credit is required by one of our inventory manufacturers to qualify for payment terms on our inventory purchases 
the standby letter of credit does not require a compensating balance  is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and expires in february no borrowings were outstanding at december  on april   activision  inc entered a senior unsecured credit agreement with vivendi as lender 
at december   the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million 
no borrowings were outstanding at december  commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for non cancelable operating lease agreements for our offices  for the development of products  and for the rights to intellectual property ip 
under these agreements  we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor  developer or intellectual property holder  as the case may be  based upon 
table of contents contractual arrangements 
the payments to third party developers are generally conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of contractually specified development milestones 
further  these payments to third party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related game 
additionally  in connection with certain intellectual property rights acquisitions and development agreements  we commit to spend specified amounts for marketing support for the related game s which is to be developed or in which the intellectual property will be utilized 
assuming all contractual provisions are met  the total future minimum commitments for these and other contractual arrangements in place at december  are scheduled to be paid as follows amounts in millions contractual obligations facility and equipment leases developer and ip marketing total for the year ending december  thereafter total we have omitted fin liabilities from this table due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of potential issue resolution 
specifically  either a the underlying positions have not been fully enough developed under audit to quantify at this time or  b the years relating to the issues for certain jurisdictions are not currently under audit 
at december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  activision blizzard had no relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operation  liquidity  capital expenditure  or capital resources

eitf addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under this conclusion  an entity is required to defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices 
our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and market prices 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates  market prices  and the timing of transactions 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities and money market funds that invest in such securities 
because short term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then current market rates  interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash  cash equivalents  or short term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities 
conversely  the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments included money market funds and mortgage backed securities of  million and million  respectively 
we have million in auction rate securities at fair value  which are classified as long term investments  at december  most of our investment portfolio is invested in short term or variable rate securities 
accordingly  we believe that a sharp change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our short term investment portfolio 

table of contents currency exchange rate risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
currency volatility is monitored frequently throughout the year 
to mitigate our risk from foreign currency fluctuations we enter into currency forward contracts with vivendi  generally with maturities of twelve months or less 

we expect to continue to use economic hedge programs in the future and may use  in addition to currency forward contracts  derivative financial instruments such as currency options to reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk 
we do not hold or purchase any foreign currency contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the following procedures are designed to prohibit speculative transactions vivendi is the counterparty for foreign currency transactions within activision blizzard  unless specific regulatory  operational  or other considerations require otherwise  and all foreign currency hedging transactions are backed  in amount and by maturity  by an identified economic underlying item 
in addition  activision blizzard may hedge foreign currency exposure resulting from foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities  consisting primarily of intercompany receivables and payables  and earnings 
at december  and december   the net notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was million and million  respectively 
a pre tax net unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  and a pre tax net unrealized loss of million for the year ended december  resulted from the forward foreign exchange contracts with vivendi and were recognized in the consolidated statement of operations
