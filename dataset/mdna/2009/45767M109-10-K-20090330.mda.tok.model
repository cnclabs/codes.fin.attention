factors that could cause actual results to differ include  but are not limited to  the company s reliance on a small number of major clients  risks associated with the terms and pricing of our contracts  reliance on the telecommunications and direct marketing industries and the effect on the company of the downturns  consolidation and changes in those industries in recent years  risks associated with the fluctuations in volumes from our clients  risks associated with upgrading  customizing  migrating or supporting existing technology  risks associated with competition  and other factors discussed in more detail in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
overview innotrac  founded in and headquartered in atlanta  georgia  is a full service fulfillment and logistics provider serving enterprise clients and world class brands 
the company employs sophisticated order processing and warehouse management technology and operates eight fulfillment centers and two call centers in seven cities spanning all time zones across the continental united states 
we intend to consolidate our reno  nevada call center into our pueblo  colorado call center facility and close our romeoville  illinois fulfillment facility during we will still have fulfillment  customer support and information technology support operations in our reno facility 
these two decisions resulted from the opportunity to improve our facility utilization in the rest of our service infrastructure following the loss of two customers who had heavy seasonal activity 
prior to  the company was primarily focused on the telecommunications industry  with over of its revenues being derived through this vertical 
today  the company is primarily focused on five diverse lines of business  or industry verticals 
this is a result of a significant effort made by the company to diversify both its industry and client base over the past several years 
we expect revenue from telecommunications and modems to be less than after key economic factors during we were focused on improving our operating efficiencies following the growth in revenue achieved in while continuing to add customers which we believe will have a long term relationship with the company 
total revenue increased million to million from million for the year ended december  and respectively 
of that revenue increase  million or resulted from new customers and million or from revenues generated from customers existing at december  our gross margin on revenues increased by to from for the years ended december  and respectively 
the company recorded a net profit of million during the year ended december  compared to a  net profit for the year ended december  the million improvement in net operating results was mainly due to increased volumes and improved pricing from existing clients and the addition of new clients  including the benefit of providing a full year of services to two direct marketing clients that were added in the fourth quarter of  combined with the ability to manage our business growth while increasing administrative overhead expense at a lesser rate 
 of non recurring expenses resulting directly from the previously announced plan of merger with gsi commerce  which was terminated in january  were included in operating expenses during the year ended december  the downturn in the overall economy in the later part of is expected to continue into we believe our mix of multiple customer industries provides some protection from the impact of that downturn 
however  we are closely monitoring the economic trends and business experience of our customers to allow us the earliest opportunity to adjust the variable labor and other non fixed costs of our operations as needed to partially offset any continued or more significant downturn 
as discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k our results can be negatively affected depending on the severity or concentration by industry of the economic downturn we are experiencing 
business mix the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues generated by the company s various business lines during and business line vertical ecommerce direct to consumer direct marketing modems bb telecommunications products ecommerce direct to consumer and direct marketing

com  a division of target corporation  ann taylor retail  inc  the north face  smith hawken  ltd  microsoft  inc  product partners and thane international 
our revenues are sensitive to the number of orders and customer service calls received 
our client contracts generally do not guarantee volumes 
the percentage of our revenues attributable to our ecommerce  direct to consumer and direct marketing clients increased during as compared to primarily due to increased volumes from these clients and the continued decline in our telecommunications and modems business which is described under the telecommunications and modems business section immediately below 
we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues attributable to our ecommerce and direct to consumer clients will continue to increase during as we continue to see growth in our customers from this group of clients to be higher than our other client categories 
telecommunications and modems 
the company has historically been a major provider of fulfillment and customer support services to the telecommunications industry 
the consolidation in that industry over the last several years has resulted in a heavy concentration of volume in a few companies and accordingly concentration of the service providers to the telecommunication industry 
as previously reported in our quarterly and annual reports  we were notified that at t intended to transition a portion of its fulfillment business in house 
the transition is currently forecasted to be completed at the end of the second quarter of after that transition is complete  we project that our telecommunications and modems customers may represent less than of our annual revenues

income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended and was 
at december   a valuation allowance was recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets as losses in recent years created uncertainty about the realization of tax benefits in future years 
the existence of a net operating loss carryforward at december  means that income taxes associated with any potential taxable earnings for the year ended december  will be offset by a corresponding decrease of this valuation allowance  resulting in an expected effective tax rate of for the year ended december  as well 
liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility with wachovia bank  na the credit facility 
additionally  from september  through its repayment on september   the company had a million second lien loan outstanding to a credit management company 
the million second lien loan outstanding was entered into when we determined that completion of capital expenditure projects in late and forecasted working capital requirements to support our seasonal volume increase during the fourth quarter of required additional short term funding 
the seasonal working capital needs were significant as a result of our growth in annual revenue to million in compared to million in the million second lien loan was repaid on september  from a combination of funds generated by operating income and additional borrowing under the credit facility 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  and additionally  during  the company increased its borrowings under its credit facility to million at december  compared to million at december  the primary use of borrowings under the credit facility is to fund recurring working capital needs resulting from our normal monthly billing and expenditure cycles  capital expenditures and our seasonal fourth quarter working capital needs 
additionally  as noted above  we repaid a million second lien loan on september  with a combination of advances on the credit facility and accumulated operating cash flow 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities in the year ended december  compared to generating million of cash from operating activities for the year ended december  the company anticipates positive cash flows from operations in the credit facility was scheduled to mature on march   but was extended for days  and was renewed on march  with a maturity date of june  the credit facility had a maximum borrowing limit of million at december  and million at december  the credit facility  as renewed on march  now has a maximum borrowing limit of million 
the credit facility is used to fund the company s capital expenditures  operational working capital and seasonal working capital needs 
the maximum borrowing limit of the credit facility was temporarily increased in october through its renewal on march  by million to fund projected seasonal working capital needs during the holiday season 
we currently project that the million maximum borrowing limit defined under the credit facility as renewed on march  will be sufficient to support seasonal working capital needs 
although total advances under the credit facility cannot exceed the maximum borrowing limit of million at december   the credit facility limits borrowings at any time to a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory  which totaled million at december  as provided for in the second waiver agreement dated april   the bank had been granted a security interest in million of the personal securities of our chairman and chief executive officer  scott dorfman  which after application of a factor against current market value of the securities  resulted in up to million of additional collateral to support the maximum borrowing limit of the credit facility 
this security interest in mr 
dorfman s personal securities was removed from the terms of the credit facility when it was renewed on march  additionally  the terms of the credit facility provide that the amount borrowed and outstanding at any time combined with certain reserves for rental payments  letters of credit outstanding and general reserves be subtracted from the facility limit or the value of the total collateral to arrive at an amount of unused availability to borrow under the line of credit 
the total collateral under the credit facility at december  amounted to million 
the amount borrowed and outstanding and the total value of reserves and letters of credit outstanding at december  amounted to million 
as a result  the company had million of borrowing availability under the revolving credit line at december  the company has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the lender as collateral under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains a restrictive fixed charge coverage ratio 
the provisions of the credit facility require that the company maintain a lockbox arrangement with the lender  and allows the lender to declare any outstanding borrowing amounts to be immediately due and payable as a result of noncompliance with any of the covenants 
accordingly  in the event of noncompliance  these amounts could be accelerated 
the fixed charge coverage ratio required the company to maintain a minimum twelve month trailing fixed charge coverage ratio of to from december through march  to for the months of april and may  to from june through september and to from october through the maturity of the facility in march the company was in compliance with all terms of the credit facility at december  the credit facility as renewed on march   also includes a restrictive twelve month trailing fixed coverage ratio covenant 
the material terms of the renewed credit facility are described in note  subsequent events 
in accordance with the sixth amendment to the credit facility signed on october   interest on borrowings under the credit facility is payable monthly at rates equal to the prime rate plus or at the company s option  libor plus 
the credit facility also provided for higher interest rates if the fixed charge ratio fell below to  however that event did not occur during while the million second lien loan was outstanding  interest was accrued on a monthly basis equal to the greater of a libor or b plus for a rate of of the principal balance plus accrued interest payable and outstanding under the second lien loan 
for the year ended december   we paid interest expense of  on the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of and  of interest expense at a constant rate of on the second lien loan for the period january  through its payoff on september  our weighted average interest rate in  including amounts borrowed under both the credit facility and the second lien loan  was 
during the year ended december  the company incurred interest expense related to the credit facility of approximately  resulting in a weighted average interest rate of and  of interest at a constant rate of on the second lien loan from its inception on september  through december  at december   the rate of interest being charged on the credit facility was 
the company also incurred unused revolving credit facility fees of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and respectively

pursuant to the credit agreement  the term of the credit facility has been extended through june  the credit facility has a maximum borrowing limit of million including the issuance of letters of credit up to million in face value  but limits borrowings to a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit agreement continues the bank s security interest in all of the company s assets  but releases the bank s previously granted security interest in certain personal assets of scott dorfman  the company s chairman  president and ceo  which were treated as additional collateral under the credit agreement 
interest on borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement is payable monthly at specified rates ranging from either the base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus between and  or  at the company s option  the libor rate as defined in the credit agreement plus between and  in each case with the applicable margin depending on the company s average excess availability as defined in the credit agreement 
the company will pay a specified fee on undrawn amounts under the credit facility 
after an event of default  all loans will bear interest at the otherwise applicable rate plus per annum

for additional information  including information regarding the interest related to the revolving line of credit  see note critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and demand the most significant use of subjective estimates and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note to our financial statements 
the policies that we believe are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below reserve for uncollectible accounts 
the company makes estimates each reporting period associated with its reserve for uncollectible accounts 
these estimates are based on the aging of the receivables and known specific facts and circumstances 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
goodwill represents the cost of an acquired enterprise in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   which changed the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment may exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
innotrac s goodwill carrying amount as of december  and was million 
this asset relates to the goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of universal distribution services uds in december and the acquisition of ifulfillment  inc in july in accordance with sfas no 
the company performs a valuation review of the company s goodwill each year 
the company recognizes only one reporting unit in its valuation analysis 
the results of that valuation  as performed as of january   supported that the fair value of the reporting unit at january  exceeds the net book value of the net assets  including goodwill  and thus no impairment currently exists 
the company will perform this impairment test annually as of january or sooner if circumstances dictate 
the valuation analysis includes the use of discounted cash flow methodology and assessment of the fair value of the company s assets 
our discounted cash flow calculation is based on a five year projection with terminal value applied to the cash flow of the fifth year 
we believe the five year discounted cash flow methodology utilizing a terminal value is the most meaningful valuation method because projection beyond five years is very subjective 
we use a discount rate of based on our weighted average cost of capital 
our cash flow projections include a consistent growth factor of in the rd  th and th years of the forecast and to the terminal value 
we believe this growth factor is representative of the opportunity provided by our strategy of servicing multiple business verticals and the level of customer penetration available to our nationwide infrastructure 
we could record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in market conditions  expected future operating results or governmental regulations that prevent us from achieving the forecasted results included in the valuation analysis 
the following table shows the net carrying value of the goodwill as of december  and illustrates the hypothetical impairment charge related to changes to our discounted cash flows ie  fair value from any combination of adjustments to key assumptions included in our impairment test performed at january  percent hypothetical reduction in fair value of reporting unit and related impairment charge in millions net carrying value of goodwill accounting for income taxes 
innotrac utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if the company considers it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
innotrac s gross deferred tax asset as of december  is million 
this deferred tax asset was generated primarily by net operating loss carryforwards created primarily by the special charge of million recorded in and the net losses generated in   and innotrac has a net operating loss carryforward of million at december  that expires between and innotrac s ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  collection of existing outstanding accounts receivable  competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond management s control 
these factors  combined with losses in recent years prior to  create uncertainty about the ultimate realization of the gross deferred tax asset in future years 
although the company expects to generate taxable earnings in  the net losses incurred in and prior years result in an inability to recognize the value of any deferred tax asset resulting from the prior years losses 
therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million and million has been recorded as of december  and  respectively against net deferred tax assets 
income taxes associated with future earnings will be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance in that future year 
for the year ended december   the deferred income tax expense of million was offset by a corresponding decrease of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
when and if the company can return to consistent profitability and management determines that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  the valuation allowance may be reduced or eliminated 
accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier application encouraged 
there was no impact on the company s financial statements upon adoption on january  relative to sfas no 
 the fasb issued fasb staff positions fsp and fsp amends sfas no 
to exclude sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions 
fsp delays the effective date of the application of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
we are currently evaluating the effect that applying sfas no 
may have on our periodic goodwill impairment tests 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this standard permits an entity to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas no 
also revises provisions of sfas no 
that apply to available for sale and trading securities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  there was no impact on the company s financial statements upon adoption on january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r which revised sfas no 
business combinations 
this revised standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and changes the requirements for measuring the value of acquired assets  the date of the measurement of the acquired assets  the use of fair value accounting and the rules for capitalization of costs of acquisition 
since sfas no 
r will apply to acquisitions occurring in the future  the company does not expect there to be any impact on the reported financial statements of the company when it is adopted 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements which amended accounting research bulletin no 
this standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and applies to reporting requirements for minority interest ownership 
the company does not expect the effect  if any  of adopting sfas no 
on its financial statements will be material
