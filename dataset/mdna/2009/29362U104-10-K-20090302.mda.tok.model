you should read the following discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the factors and uncertainties that may affect future results section of this item the company s actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
overview this overview is not a complete discussion of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  it is intended merely to facilitate an understanding of the most salient aspects of its financial condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the discussion that follows 
the detailed discussion and analysis that follows must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand the company s financial condition and results of operations 
entegris  inc is a leading provider of products and services that purify  protect and transport the critical materials used in key technology driven industries 
entegris derives most of its revenue from the sale of products and services to the semiconductor and data storage industries 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers  and hard disk manufacturers  which are served through direct sales efforts  as well as sales and distribution relationships  in the united states  asia  europe and the middle east 
the company offers a diverse product portfolio which includes more than  standard and customized products that we believe provide the most comprehensive offering of materials integrity management products and services to the microelectronics industry 
certain of these products are unit driven and consumable products that rely on the level of semiconductor manufacturing activity to drive growth  while others rely on expansion of manufacturing capacity to drive growth 
the company s unit driven and consumable product class includes wafer shippers  disk shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products  membrane based liquid filters and housings  metal based gas filters and resin based gas purifiers  as well as pva roller brushes for use in post cmp cleaning applications 
the company s capital expense driven products include its process carriers that protect the integrity of in process wafers  components  systems and subsystems that use electro mechanical  pressure differential and related technologies to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes 
with its august acquisition of poco graphite  inc poco described below  the company added process critical  graphite based consumables and finished products used in a variety of markets to its portfolio of products 
key operating factors key factors  which management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of entegris  inc  include level of sales since a large portion of the company s product costs except for raw materials  purchased components and direct labor are largely fixed in the short to medium term  an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly 
also  increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affect certain costs such as incentive compensation and commissions  which are highly variable in nature 
the company s sales are subject to effects of industry cyclicality  technological change and substantial competition  including pricing pressures 
variable margin on sales the company s variable margin on sales is determined by selling prices and the costs of manufacturing and raw materials 
this is also affected by a number of factors  which include the company s sales mix  purchase prices of raw material especially resin and purchased components  competition  both domestic and international  direct labor costs  and the efficiency of the company s production operations  among others 
fixed cost structure increases or decreases in sales have a large impact on profitability 
there are a number of large fixed or semi fixed cost components  which include salaries  indirect labor and benefits  facility costs  lease expense  and depreciation and amortization 
it is not possible to vary these costs easily in the short term as volumes fluctuate 
thus changes in sales volumes can affect the usage and productivity of these cost components and can have a large effect on the company s results of operations 
overall summary of financial results for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net sales were million  down million  or  from net sales of million reported for the year ended december  
the sales decline was mitigated by the inclusion of sales of million from poco  which was acquired in august  sales of million related to the full year inclusion of sales from the specialty coatings business acquired in august  and a favorable foreign currency translation effect of million 
excluding those mitigating factors  sales fell in when compared to mainly reflecting the lower factory utilization associated with the year over year sales decrease and the million incremental charge associated with the fair market value write up of inventory acquired in the acquisition of poco  the company reported considerably lower gross profits and a reduced gross margin 
the company s gross margin in was versus in the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million in  the key element of the year over year reduction being the absence of incentive and profit sharing compensation 
the company reported a loss from continuing operations of million for compared to income of million in the loss was substantially attributable to goodwill impairment charges of million million  net of tax 
the goodwill impairment charges  described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  have no impact on the company s liquidity  cash flows from operating activities  or debt covenants 
as noted above  the company acquired poco on august  for cash consideration of million 
based in decatur  texas  poco is a leading provider of process critical  graphite based consumables and finished products used in a variety of markets 
the acquisition was funded with a combination of existing cash balances and funds available from the company s domestic credit facility 
during  the company s operating activities provided cash flow of million 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared with million at december  the decrease in cash mainly reflects the acquisition of poco in the third quarter  partially offset by the cash provided by operating activities and an increase in long term debt 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  warranty and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  business combinations and shared based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
net sales the company s net sales consist of revenue from sales of products net of trade discounts and allowances 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment  primarily fob shipping point  when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured based upon historical collection results and regular credit evaluations 
in most transactions  the company has no obligations to its customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in the event that significant post shipment obligations or uncertainties exist such as customer acceptance  revenue recognition is deferred as appropriate until such obligations are fulfilled or the uncertainties are resolved 
accounts receivable related valuation accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management considers the age of receivable balances and historical bad debts write off experience when determining its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
an allowance for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical and current trends in product returns 
at december  and  the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
each quarter  the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  and sales levels by product 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or a full allowance is recorded 
in addition  allowances are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company s inventories include materials and products subject to technological obsolescence  which are sold in highly competitive industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current conditions  additional inventory write downs or allowances may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company s annual impairment test is performed as of august factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review  and potentially an impairment charge  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  resulting in the company s market capitalization being below its net book value 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company tested for impairment of its goodwill in connection with its annual impairment test of goodwill as of august   and due to events and changes in circumstances through the end of  the company had an additional triggering event that indicated impairments had occurred 
based on the results of the company s assessment of goodwill for impairment  it was determined that the carrying value of the company s net assets exceeded its estimated fair value 
therefore  the company performed a second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value its goodwill 
the company performed the assessment of impairment of its goodwill twice during the year  once during the third quarter  when the company wrote off million of goodwill  and the second time at the end of the year  when the company wrote off the remaining goodwill of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of its property and equipment assets  particularly its molding equipment  and its intangible assets  are present 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset group in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its respective fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the asset groups determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset group is less than the assets carrying value 
the fair value of the assets then becomes the assets new carrying value  which is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the assets 
in connection with the triggering events discussed above  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year the company reviewed its long lived assets and determined that none of its long lived assets were impaired for its asset groups 
the determination was based on reviewing estimated undiscounted cash flows for the company s asset groups  which were greater than their carrying values 
as required under us generally accepted accounting principles  the sfas no 
impairment analysis occurred before the sfas no 
goodwill impairment assessment 
the evaluation of the recoverability of long lived assets requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the primary asset of the group  and long range forecasts of revenue  reflecting management s assessment of general economic and industry conditions  operating income  depreciation and amortization and working capital requirements 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  particularly in the current economic environment and plan for a recovery  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group s carrying value is recoverable  or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired 
due to the decline in the company s market capitalization and the uncertain economic environment within the semiconductor industry  the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events in future periods to determine whether additional asset impairment testing is warranted 
it is not unlikely that in the future the company may no longer be able to conclude that there is no impairment of its long lived assets  nor can the company provide assurance that material impairment charges of long lived assets will not occur in future periods 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
management considered the positive and negative evidence for the potential utilization of its deferred tax assets based upon an application of the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and related accounting pronouncements 
management concluded that it is not more likely than not that the company will realize certain deferred tax assets and provided an allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets management concluded will not be utilized 
as a result  the company recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million  which is included in income tax expense for in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
warranty claims accrual the company records a liability for estimated warranty claims 
the amount of the accrual is based on historical claims data by product group and other factors 
estimated claims could be materially different from actual results for a variety of reasons  including a change in product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
at december  and  the company s accrual for estimated future warranty costs was million and million  respectively 
business acquisitions the company accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact net income 
accordingly  for significant acquisitions  the company typically obtains assistance from independent valuation specialists 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  the company normally utilizes the income method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
for example  different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact net income 
share based compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
under sfas r  the company must estimate the value of employee stock option and restricted stock awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is valued based on the company s stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate and dividend yield assumptions  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures 
because share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been recorded net of estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if the above factors change  and the company uses different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the share based compensation expense recorded under sfas r may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
certain restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards involve stock to be issued upon the achievement of performance conditions performance shares under the company s stock incentive plans 
such performance shares become available subject to time based vesting conditions if  and to the extent that  financial performance criteria for the applicable fiscal year or multi year period are achieved 
accordingly  the number of performance shares earned will vary based on the level of achievement of financial performance objectives for the applicable period 
until such time that the company s performance can ultimately be determined  each quarter the company estimates the number of performance shares more likely than not to be earned based on an evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance objectives 
such estimates are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods when the underlying factors change the company s evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance objectives 
accordingly  share based compensation expense associated with performance shares recorded under sfas r may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the years ended december  and the company s historical financial data was derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
dollars in thousands of net sales of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  research and development expenses amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill restructuring charges operating loss profit interest expense income  net other expense income  net loss income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliates income tax expense equity in net loss earnings of affiliates net loss income from continuing operations net sales for the year ended december   net sales were million  down million  or  from sales for the year ended december  
the sales decline was mitigated by the inclusion of sales of million from poco  which was acquired in august  sales of million related to the full year inclusion of sales from the specialty coatings business acquired in august  and a favorable foreign currency translation effect of million 
excluding those mitigating factors  sales fell in compared to the currency effect reflected the strengthening of most international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably the japanese yen and the euro 
on a geographic basis  total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in demand drivers for the company s business primarily consist of semiconductor fab utilization and production unit driven as well as capital spending for new or upgraded semiconductor fabrication facilities capital driven 
the company analyzes sales of its products by these two key drivers 
both unit driven and capital driven sales in decreased as compared with sales of unit driven products represented of sales and sales of capital driven products represented of total sales in this compares to a unit driven to capital driven ratio of for  indicating a decrease in demand of capital driven sales within the industry over the past twelve months 
sales of unit driven products fell in excluding sales of poco  sales of unit driven products fell in unit driven products have average lives of less than months or need to be replaced based on usage levels 
these products include liquid filters used in the photolithography  cmp and wet etch and clean processes  and in wafer shippers used to ship raw wafers  particularly at wafer sizes of mm and below  as well as in chip trays and data storage components used to ship mm and mm disk drives 
sales of shippers declined  partially offset by the increase in sales of mm wafer shippers of 
in addition  sales of filtration products declined by 
year over year sales of capital driven products decreased in capital driven products include wafer process carriers  gas microcontamination control systems used in the deployment of advanced photolithography processes  fluid handling systems  including dispense pumps used in the photolithography process  and integrated liquid flow controllers used in various processes around the fab 
sales of control systems declined by due to lower sales of dispense pumps  which fell by 
sales of wafer transport products fell by  such as mm foup products which declined by 
sales of filtration products also fell by primarily due to decreased sales of gas filtration products 
gross profit gross profit for decreased by million  to million  a decrease of from million for the gross margin rate for was versus for the gross profit decline was primarily due to lower utilization of the company s production facilities compared to the prior period  as well as the fair market value write up of inventory discussed below 
production volumes were considerably lower in despite significant increases in the price of oil and other commodities during much of  price increases for the company s raw materials and purchased components were relatively modest on a year over year basis 
charges to cost of sales associated with obsolescence and excess inventory quantities were million lower in compared to gross margin in included a million incremental charge associated with the fair market value write up of inventory acquired in the acquisition of poco 
this incremental charge had a negative impact on the overall gross margin for the inventory write up was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation and is charged to cost of sales over inventory turns of the acquired inventory 
the company expects to record additional incremental charges of million associated with the fair market value write up of poco inventory  most of which will be recorded in the first quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million for decreased million  or  compared to million in sg a expenses  as a percent of net sales  increased to from a year earlier 
the year over year decrease in sg a costs includes reductions in commissions and incentive compensation totaling million  share based compensation expense and pension expense of million  and royalty expense of million 
in addition  costs of million were incurred by the company in in connection with the integration and realignment activities associated with the mykrolis merger 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in sg a costs reflecting the effect of foreign currency translation 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses rose by million  or  to million in compared to million in er d expenses as a percent of net sales were compared to a year ago 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million for the increase mainly reflects the additional amortization expenses related to the intangibles of poco that were acquired in august and the full year amortization of the intangibles of the specialty coatings business acquired in august impairment of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performed the assessment of impairment of its goodwill twice during the year  once in connection with its annual impairment test of goodwill as of august  and due to events and changes in circumstances through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had a second trigger event that indicated impairments had occurred 
in addition  the company tested for impairment its long lived assets principally property  plant and equipment and intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted impairment triggering events included a significant decrease in the company s market capitalization throughout  to a level significantly below the recorded value of its consolidated net assets  and a significant decline in the current and forecasted business level 
as a result of the impairment assessments  the company recorded impairment charges of goodwill of million in as of december   the company had no remaining goodwill 
restructuring charges in  the company initiated a global business restructuring of its sales and marketing function  manufacturing operations  and realignment of the global supply chain and other ancillary operational functions 
related to these cost reduction initiatives  the company announced on november  that it will close the larger of its two manufacturing facilities in chaska  minnesota and will transfer production to its other existing facilities 
associated with these changes  the company recorded million in restructuring charges in  consisting mainly of employee severance costs 
interest expense income  net net interest expense was million in compared to interest income of million in the decrease reflects lower average invested balances compared to a year ago and an increase in the company s short term borrowings and long term debt in other expense income other expense was million in compared to other income of million in other expense in includes impairment losses on equity investments of million and foreign currency transaction losses of million 
other income in includes foreign currency transaction gains of million and a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the company s interest in a privately held equity investment accounted for using the cost method 
proceeds from the sale totaled million 
income tax expense the company recorded income tax expense of million in  compared to income tax expense of million in the effective tax rate was in compared with a rate in the effective tax rate for is principally attributable to two factors 
the company recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in most of the company s goodwill impairment charge is not deductible for income tax purposes 
accordingly  the company recognized a tax benefit of only million in connection with the impairment charge 
also during  the company recorded a million valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets consisting primarily of net operating loss carryovers  general business carryovers and foreign tax credit carryforwards  million of which related to discontinued operations 
the company carried no valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  as a result of the recent general economic and industry downturn  and its impact on the company s future outlook  management has reviewed its deferred tax assets and concluded that the uncertainties related to the realization of its assets  have become unfavorable 
management considered the positive and negative evidence for the potential utilization of its deferred tax assets based upon an application of the principles of sfas no 
and related accounting pronouncements 
management concluded that it is not more likely than not that the company will realize certain deferred tax assets and thus provided an allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets management concluded will not be utilized 
the company s tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate for a number of reasons 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s japanese subsidiary declared a dividend of billon yen approximately us million and also loaned billion yen approximately us million to the company 
the resulting recharacterization of million of the japanese subsidiary s accumulated undistributed earnings resulted in a fourth quarter tax benefit of million  net of state income tax expense 
the company also benefited from the tax holiday in malaysia in in the amount of million 
discontinued operations the company s businesses classified as discontinued operations recorded a net loss of million in the company completed the sale of its cleaning equipment business  classified as a discontinued operation  for proceeds of million in april the company s discontinued operations recorded a net loss of million for these results included an operating loss of million  a pre tax impairment charge of million recorded in connection with the write down of long lived assets to fair value less cost to sell  and a tax benefit of million related to a reduction in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance  resulting from the utilization of a capital loss carryforward to offset a portion of the capital gain on the sale of an equity investment 
net loss income the company recorded a net loss of million  or per share  in  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the company s loss from continuing operations for was million  or per share  compared to income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the years ended december  and the company s historical financial data was derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
dollars in thousands of net sales of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  research and development expenses amortization of intangible assets operating profit interest income  net other income  net income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliates income tax expense equity in net earnings of affiliates net income from continuing operations net sales for the year ended december   net sales were million  down million  or  from sales for the year ended december  
net sales for included favorable foreign currency translation effects of million 
this reflected the strengthening of certain international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably the euro 
on a geographic basis  total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in sales from products of the high purity semiconductor coatings business acquired in the third quarter totaled million in demand drivers for the company s business primarily consist of semiconductor fab utilization and production unit driven as well as capital spending for new or upgraded semiconductor fabrication facilities capital driven 
the company analyzes sales of its products by these two key drivers 
both unit driven and capital driven sales in decreased as compared with sales of unit driven products represented of sales and sales of capital driven products represented of total sales in this compares to a unit driven to capital driven ratio of for sales of unit driven products fell in as semiconductor fab utilization rates were relatively flat 
unit driven products have average lives of less than months or need to be replaced based on usage levels 
these products include liquid filters used in the photolithography  cmp and wet etch and clean processes  and in wafer shippers used to ship raw wafers  particularly at wafer sizes of mm and below  as well as in chip trays and data storage components used to ship mm and mm disk drives 
sales of wafer shippers declined  while sales of disk shippers fell  primarily due to lower sales of mm shippers 
year over year sales of capital driven products decreased in capital driven products include wafer process carriers  gas microcontamination control systems used in the deployment of advanced photolithography processes  fluid handling systems  including dispense pumps used in the photolithography process  and integrated liquid flow controllers used in various processes around the fab 
sales of liquid systems also declined in the latter half of  reflecting the general slowing in the industry 
wafer transport products  such as mm foup products  also fell  particularly at some north american customers 
sales of gas microcontamination control products fell after reaching peak levels in gross profit gross profit for decreased by million  to million  a decrease of from million for the gross margin rate for was versus for the gross profit decline was primarily due to the lower utilization of the company s production facilities compared to the prior period 
production volumes were considerably lower in as the company sold inventory on hand to satisfy customer demand  particularly in the first half of the year 
prices for raw materials were relatively stable on a year over year basis 
gross margin for also was affected by million in transition costs such as travel  sampling and customer qualification costs related to the transfer of four product lines from us facilities to the company s facility in kulim  malaysia 
costs of million associated with the consolidation or closure of manufacturing facilities in the us and singapore also reduced gross profit in gross margin in included a million cost of sales charge associated with the fair market value write up of inventory acquired in the purchase of the assets of the high purity semiconductor coatings business acquired in the third quarter of the inventory write up was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation and is charged to cost of sales over inventory turns of the acquired inventory 
gross profit in was reduced by costs of million incurred in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in the us  germany and japan 
offsetting these charges to gross profit was a gain of million on the sale of a facility recognized during the second quarter of gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of was lower than the strong levels achieved earlier in the year due to manufacturing inefficiencies experienced at a north american plant in the third quarter and expenses incurred in the fourth quarter in connection with a comprehensive worldwide review of the company s manufacturing operations to identify and resolve manufacturing inefficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million for decreased million  or  compared to million in sg a expenses  as a percent of net sales  increased to from a year earlier 
the year over year decrease in sg a costs reflects the lower sg a expenses incurred by the company in connection with the integration activities associated with the mykrolis merger and other realignment activities  as well as the benefit of the consolidation of various sales  marketing and other corporate functions during costs of million were incurred by the company in in connection with the integration and realignment activities associated with the mykrolis merger  compared to million in the costs included in this category generally relate to expenses incurred to integrate mykrolis operations and systems into the company s pre existing operations and systems 
these costs include  but are not limited to  the integration of information systems  employee benefits and compensation  accounting finance  tax  treasury  risk management  compliance  administrative services  sales and marketing and other functions and include severance and retention costs 
the year over year decrease in sg a expenses also includes a decline in incremental share based compensation expense of million  offset by an increase in professional fees of million 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses rose by million  or  to million in compared to million in er d expenses as a percent of net sales were compared to in the increase reflected higher product sampling costs as the company continued to focus on the support of current product lines and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million in the increase mainly reflects the additional amortization expenses related to the intangibles of the specialty coatings business acquired in august interest income  net net interest income was million in compared to million in the decrease reflects lower average invested balances compared to the prior year  primarily related to the company s use of cash to finance the repurchase of its common shares during the second quarter of other income other income in includes a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the company s interest in a privately held equity investment accounted for using the cost method 
proceeds from the sale totaled million 
income tax expense the company recorded income tax expense of million in  compared to income tax expense of million in the effective tax rate was in compared with a rate a year earlier 
the company s tax rate was lower than statutory rates for a number of reasons 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s japanese subsidiary declared a dividend of billon yen approximately us million and also loaned billion yen approximately us million to the company 
the resulting recharacterization of million of the japanese subsidiary s accumulated undistributed earnings resulted in a fourth quarter tax benefit of million  net of state income tax expense 
the company also benefited from a tax holiday in malaysia whereby  as a result of employment commitments  research and development expenditures and capital investments made by the company  income from certain manufacturing activities in malaysia was exempt from tax with tax benefits in in the amount of million 
in  the company s benefit from the tax holiday was million 
the effective tax rate was also lower due to a corporate income tax refund of million resulting from new legislation in germany and a million favorable adjustment recorded to recognize the reconciliation of the company s federal tax return and tax accounts 
partially offsetting these reductions was an increase to the company s tax contingency reserves 
discontinued operations the company s businesses classified as discontinued operations recorded losses of million  net of taxes  in these results included an operating loss of million  a pre tax impairment charge of million recorded in connection with the write down of long lived assets to fair value less cost to sell  and a tax benefit of million related to a reduction in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance  resulting from the utilization of a capital loss carryforward to offset a portion of the capital gain on the sale of an equity investment 
the company s discontinued operations recorded income of million net of taxes for the after tax earnings of discontinued operations in included a tax benefit of million associated with a decrease in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance described above 
the change in the valuation allowance resulted from the settlement of negotiations regarding the terms of sale of a discontinued operation which established the characterization of certain gains and losses

a global credit market crisis has created a very difficult business environment 
these conditions have generally worsened since october the company s operating performance  as well as its liquidity position  has been and continues to be negatively affected by these economic conditions  many of which are beyond its control 
the company does not believe it is likely that these adverse economic conditions  and their effect on the semiconductor industry  will improve significantly in the near term 
however  the effect of current global economic environment on the semiconductor industry requires that the company maintain its near term liquidity support 
the amended credit facility requires that the company meet various financial covenants 
if the company s future financial performance fails to meet these financial covenants  then its lenders may take control of the company s cash receipts from the collection of its receivables as well as certain other assets 
in this event  the company s ability to conduct business could be severely impeded as there can be no assurance that funds adequate in amounts and timing will be available to meet the company s liquidity requirements 
the company plans to manage its business during this time through a series of operating measures designed to reduce expenditures and to generate incremental cash flow through asset management initiatives 
if the economic environment does not improve in  the company s planned and initiated actions may not be sufficient and could lead to possibly failing the financial debt covenants required under the amended credit facility 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and funds available under its amended domestic credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital and investment requirements for the next months 
if available liquidity is not sufficient to meet the company s operating and debt service obligations as they come due  management s plans include reducing expenditures as necessary  or pursuing alternative arrangements through additional equity or debt financing  in order to meet the company s cash requirements through however  there can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms 
the following table summarizes the maturities of the company s significant financial obligations as of december  maturity by fiscal year in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations related to off balance sheet arrangements operating leases foreign currency contracts total contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet long term debt pension obligations total as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company amended its existing domestic credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement has a maturity date of november the company adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
as of january  the company had million and million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits at december  and  respectively 
the timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend on a number of factors 
accordingly  the company cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the amount and period of potential cash settlements  if any  with taxing authorities 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks entegris principal financial market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s interest bearing cash equivalents and certain long term debt are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
most of the company s long term debt at december  carries floating rates of interest 
the company s cash equivalents are instruments with maturities of three months or less 
a basis point change in interest rates would potentially increase or decrease annual net income by approximately million annually 
the cash flows and earnings of the company s foreign based operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company occasionally uses derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its foreign based operations 
at december   the company was party to forward contracts to deliver euros with notional values of approximately million 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would potentially result in exchange gains or losses that could increase or decrease net income by approximately million 
on february   the company entered into a month japanese yen based cross currency interest rate swap  with aggregate notional principal amounts of billion japanese yen and million that matured on november  this swap effectively hedged a portion of the company s net investment in its japanese subsidiary 
during the term of this transaction  the company remitted to  and received from  its counterparty interest payments based on rates that were reset quarterly equal to three month japanese libor and three month us libor rates  respectively 
the company designated this hedging instrument as a hedge of a portion of the net investment in its japanese subsidiary  and used the spot rate method of accounting to value changes of the hedging instrument attributable to currency rate fluctuations 
accordingly  a million adjustment in the fair market value of the hedging instrument related to changes in the spot rate was recorded as a charge to foreign currency translation within accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity in to offset changes in a portion of the yen denominated net investment in the company s japanese subsidiary and will remain there until the net investment is disposed 
the company recorded million in net interest income in in connection with the cross currency interest rate swap 
impact of inflation the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the cost of materials  including polymers and stainless steel  was generally flat in compared to due to increased production capacity of suppliers  despite higher oil prices 
entegris expects the cost of these materials to increase slightly in higher oil prices contributed to higher freight costs in despite the fall in oil prices in recent months  freight costs remain above the levels experienced before last year s increase in oil prices 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits rose in  but slightly lower total costs can be reasonably anticipated for due to the company s actions to align spending with expected sales volumes 
the company s products are sold under contractual arrangements with its large customers and at current market prices to other customers 
consequently  the company can adjust its selling prices  to the extent allowed by competition and contractual arrangements  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
however  many of these cost increases may not be recoverable
