critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this report  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company as follows revenue from system contracting projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and  therefore  take into account the costs  estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed 
revenue recognized is that percentage of the total contract price that cost expended to date bears to anticipated final total cost  based on current estimates of costs to complete 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  and depreciation costs 
selling  general  and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
claims for additional contract costs are recognized upon a signed change order from the customer or in accordance with paragraphs and of aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop revenue from product sales is recognized when the goods are delivered and title has passed 
product sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods  net of the value added tax vat 
all of the company s products that are sold in the prc are subject to a chinese value added tax at a rate of percent of the gross sales price 
this vat may be offset by vat paid by the company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing their finished product 
revenue from the rendering of maintenance services is recognized when such services are provided 
provision is made for foreseeable losses as soon as they are anticipated by management 
where contract costs incurred to date plus recognized profits less recognized losses exceed progress billings  the surplus is treated as an amount due from contract consumers 
where progress billings exceed contract costs incurred to date plus recognized profits less recognized losses  the surplus is treated as an amount due to contract customers 
foreign currency translation the reporting currency of the company is the us dollar 
the company uses their local currency  renminbi rmb  as their functional currency

historically  the company has not engaged in any currency trading or hedging  although there is no assurance that the company will not enter into such activities in the future

depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets with a percent residual value 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the combined financial statements and accompanying notes

actual results could differ from these estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
our cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes and consist primarily of bank deposits 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we currently do not have any long term debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash invested in demand deposits 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio in order to reduce interest rate risk 
interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk and our future interest income may change  depending on market interest rate movement 
foreign currency risk our business is operated in the prc  and its value is effectively denominated in renminbi 
the fluctuation of foreign exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi could affect the value of our common stock 
our revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in renminbi  and so our exposure to foreign exchange risks should generally be limited 
we do not have material monetary assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars  although to the extent that we do in the future  the fluctuation of foreign exchange rate would affect the value of these monetary assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars 
generally  appreciation of renminbi against us dollars will devaluate the assets and liabilities denominated in us dollar  while devaluation of renminbi again us dollars will appreciate the assets and liabilities denominated in us dollar 
in china  very limited hedging transactions are available to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all
