item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rofin sinar technologies inc is a leader in the design  development  engineering  manufacture  and marketing of laser based products  primarily used for cutting  welding  and marking a wide range of materials 
lasers are a non contact technology for material processing  which have several advantages compared to conventional manufacturing tools that are desirable in industrial applications 
the company s lasers all deliver a high quality beam at guaranteed power outputs and feature compact design  high processing speed  flexibility  low operating and maintenance costs  and easy integration into the customer s production process 
as a technological leader in co  solid state lasers  and diode lasers  the company is able to meet a broad range of its customers material processing requirements 
based on the revised industry data of the optoelectronics report for laser products used for macro cutting and welding applications and marking and micro fine cutting  fine welding  perforating and structuring applications combined  the company had a worldwide market share based on sales volume in of approximately 
due to the severe global economic downturn  there are no reliable industry forecasts available for to calculate market share 
the company has sold more than  laser sources since and currently has over  active customers including multinational companies with multiple facilities purchasing from the company 
during fiscal   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues related to sales of laser products for macro applications  approximately   and  respectively  related to sales of components  and approximately   and  respectively  related to sales of laser products for marking and micro applications 
through its global manufacturing  distribution and service network  the company provides a comprehensive range of laser sources and laser based system solutions to the following principal target markets the machine tool  automotive  the semiconductor  electronics and photovoltaic industries 
the company sells directly to end users and to original equipment manufacturers oems principally in the machine tool industry that integrate rofin s laser sources with other system components

during fiscal   and    and  respectively  of the company s sales were in north america    and  respectively  were in europe and   and  respectively  were in asia 
see note  geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the fiscal year ended september   was strongly influenced by the severe economic downturn in the global economy 
fiscal year sales were negatively impacted by postponed shipments and order cancellations in various industries 
with very few exceptions  we experienced diminished demand across all industries 
the company took action to reduce its worldwide cost structure to address the declined global business without sacrificing its goal of broadening its customer base 
these actions included labor cost reductions in both hours and headcount  and elimination of non critical services provided by third parties 
due to the effect of lower fixed cost absorption and additional costs related to headcount reductions  we reported a significant reduction in net income  compared to fiscal year outlook management is cautiously optimistic that the bottom of macroeconomic downturn has been reached 
although visibility is still limited  we are seeing the first signs of a slight market recovery  demonstrated by increasing service business volume and higher order activity 
in addition  in some geographic regions we are experiencing a more positive customer sentiment due to the stimulus packages 
this  combined with our focus on broadening our product portfolio for dedicated applications in emerging industries  should help to continue to build sequential revenue growth in the coming quarters

as of september   million was outstanding under the short term lines of credit 
additionally  million was used for bank guarantees under these lines of credit 
million was outstanding from the long term loan 
additionally the company maintained credit lines specific to bank guarantees for million  of which million was used 
therefore  million was unused and available under rofin s lines of credit 
the company is subject to financial covenants under some of these facilities and lines of credit  which could restrict the company from drawing money under them 
at september   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million during fiscal year approximately million in cash and cash equivalents were provided by operating activities  primarily as the result of the decrease in accounts receivable and inventories

currency exchange rate fluctuations although the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in us dollars  approximately of its net sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro  swedish krona  swiss francs  british pound  singapore dollar  taiwanese dollar  korean won  japanese yen  canadian dollar  and chinese rmb 
net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses 
exchange differences upon translation from each operation s functional currency to us dollars are accumulated as a separate component of equity 
the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity had the effect of increasing total equity by million at september   as compared to million at september  the fluctuation of the euro and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods 
the company defines the term constant currency to mean that financial data for a period are translated into us dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate financial data for the previously reported period 
changes in sales  gross profit and income from operations include the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s management reviews and analyzes business results on a constant currency basis and believes these results better represent the company s underlying business trends without distortion due to currency fluctuations 
the company believes that this constant currency financial information is a useful measure for investors because it reflects actual changes in operations 
the following chart compares our net sales  gross profit  and income from operations for each of fiscal years   and to the equivalent financial results calculated on a constant currency basis 
because this constant currency financial information does not conform to generally accepted accounting principles  it is presented under the caption non gaap constant currency fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year gaap actual non gaap constant currency gaap actual non gaap constant currency gaap actual non gaap constant currency in millions net sales gross profit income from operations between fiscal year and  the average exchange rate for the euro weakened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this weakening was to decrease net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of sales were denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
this weakening of the euro had the effect of decreasing operating expense by million  thereby increasing income from operations only by million 
between fiscal year and  the average exchange rate for the euro strengthened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this strengthening was to increase net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of fiscal year sales were denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for uncollectible customer accounts receivable based on historical experience 
additionally  an allowance is made based on an assessment of specific customers financial condition and liquidity 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
no individual customer represents more than of total accounts receivable 
any increase in allowance will impact operating income during a given period 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  after provisions for excess and obsolete inventory salable at prices below cost 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on current assessments about historical experience and future product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
the company evaluates the adequacy of these provisions quarterly 
although the company strives to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory excess or obsolescence  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional provisions may be needed 
any changes in provisions will impact operating income during a given period 
warranty reserves the company provides reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties when revenue is recognized 
the company relies upon historical experience  expectation of future conditions  and its service data to estimate its warranty reserve 
the company continuously monitors these data to ensure that the reserve is sufficient 
warranty costs have historically been within our expectations 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims such costs may include material  labor  and travel costs  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
increases in reserves will impact operating income during the period 
pension obligations the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
assumptions are made about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  total turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  the company provides the actuarial consultants with subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop their calculations of these amounts 
the company generally reviews these assumptions at the beginning of each fiscal year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that the company uses may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension benefits expense the company has recorded or may record 
the discount rate enables the company to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the company has little latitude in selecting this rate and it must represent the market rate of high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
share based payment stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite vesting period 
we make judgments about the fair value of the awards  including the expected term of the award  volatility of the underlying stock and estimated forfeitures  which impact the amount of compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
such amounts may change as a result of additional grants  forfeitures  modifications in assumptions and other factors 
the income tax effects of share based payments are recognized in the financial statements for those awards which will normally result in tax deductions under existing tax law 
under current us federal tax laws  we receive a compensation expense deduction related to stock options only when those options are exercised and vested shares are received 
accordingly  the financial statement recognition of compensation cost for stock options creates a deductible temporary difference which results in a deferred tax asset and a corresponding deferred tax benefit in the income statement for all us based employees 
stock compensation expense related to non us employees is treated as a permanent difference for income tax purposes
