item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview this document contains various forward looking statements and information that are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to vary materially from those contained in such forward  looking statements 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated  expected or projected 
certain of these as well as other risks and uncertainties are described in more detail in this annual report on form k 
the company develops  markets and supports service management software solutions  which are licensed to companies that sell and service equipment  or sell and deliver professional services 
the company s principal product offerings  astea alliance and fieldcentrix enterprise suites  integrate and automate sales and service business processes and thereby increase competitive advantages  top line revenue growth and profitability through better management of information  people  assets and cash flows 
astea alliance offers substantially broader and far superior capabilities over the company s predecessor product  dispatch  which was designed for only field service and customer support management applications 
the company s products and services are primarily used in industries such as information technology  medical devices and diagnostic systems  industrial controls and instrumentation  retail systems  office automation  imaging systems  facilities management and telecommunications 
an eclectic group of other industries  all with equipment sales and service requirements  are also represented in astea s customer base 
the company maintains offices in the united states  united kingdom  australia  israel and the netherlands 
the company generates revenues from two sources software license fees for its software products  and services and maintenance revenues from professional services  which includes consulting  implementation  training and maintenance related to those products 
software license fees accounted for of the company s total revenues in  which was mostly comprised of sales of astea alliance 
software license fee revenues also include some fees from the sublicensing of third party software  primarily knowledge management  mapping and analytical software licenses 
typically  customers pay a license fee for the software based on the number of licensed users 
depending on the contract terms and conditions  software license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
if significant vendor obligations exist at the time of delivery or if the product is subject to uncertain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until no significant obligations remain or acceptance has occurred 
the remaining component of the company s revenues consists principally of fees derived from professional services associated with the implementation and deployment of the company s software products and maintenance fees for ongoing customer support  primarily external customer technical support services and product enhancements 
professional services including training are charged on an hourly or daily basis and billed on a regular basis pursuant to customer work orders 
training services may also be charged on a per attendee basis with a minimum daily charge 
out of pocket expenses incurred by company personnel performing professional services are typically reimbursed by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are performed 
maintenance fees are typically paid to the company under written agreements entered into at the time of the initial software license 
maintenance revenue  which is generally invoiced annually  is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its summary of accounting policies  note  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below  however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition astea s revenue is principally recognized from two sources i licensing arrangements and ii services and maintenance 
the company markets its products primarily through its direct sales force and resellers 
license agreements do not provide for a right of return  and historically  product returns have not been significant 
the company recognizes revenue on its software products in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from license sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
we utilize written contracts as a means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products support and services are sold to our customers 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs after a license key has been delivered electronically to the customer 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms in excess of one year is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
if collectability is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
our typical end user license agreements do not contain acceptance clauses 
however  if acceptance criteria are required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance has occurred 
if these criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
there may be cases  however  in which there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item s but no such evidence for the delivered item s 
in those cases  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item s equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered item s 
we apply the revenue recognition policies discussed below to each separate unit of accounting 
astea allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the elements respective fair value  determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
specifically  astea determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the price  at the date of sale  if sold separately  which is generally a fixed percentage of the software license selling price 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which the company charges for those services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
if an undelivered element for which evidence of fair value does not exist  all revenue in an arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered or fair value can be determined 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of the revenue recognized upon delivery can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of undelivered elements 
the residual value  after allocation of the fee to the undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  is then allocated to the perpetual software license for the software products being sold 
when appropriate  the company may allocate a portion of its software revenue to post contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non standard rates when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement 
amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products which  in the company s opinion  approximate fair value 
software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the company s standard prices 
the company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer 
revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally twelve months on a straight line basis 
consulting and training service revenue is generally unbundled and recognized at the time the service is performed 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that the contract has been executed  delivery of the software has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
we believe that our accounting estimates used in applying our revenue recognition are critical because the determination that it is probable that the customer will pay for the products and services purchased is inherently judgmental  the allocation of proceeds to certain elements in multiple element arrangements is complex  the determination of whether a service is essential to the functionality of the software is complex  establishing company specific fair values of elements in multiple element arrangements requires adjustments from time to time to reflect recent prices charged when each element is sold separately  and the determination of the stage of completion for certain consulting arrangements is complex 
changes in the aforementioned items could have a material effect on the type and timing of revenue recognized 
if we were to change our pricing approach in the future  this could affect our revenue recognition estimates  in particular  if bundled pricing precludes establishment of vsoe 
in june  the fasb reached a consensus on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  eitf 
eitf indicates that the income statement presentation on either a gross basis or a net basis of the taxes within the scope of the issue is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf did not change our policy of presenting taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
deferred revenue deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from post contract support  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered or license revenue which has been deferred until all revenue requirements have been met or as services are performed 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts regarding accounts receivable the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the company 
actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on the company s revenue recognition policy  but due to contractual restraints  the company does not have the right to invoice the customer 
we believe that our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts is critical because of the significance of our accounts receivable balance relative to total assets 
if the general economy deteriorated  or factors affecting the profitability or liquidity of the industry changed significantly  then this could affect the accuracy of our allowance for doubtful account capitalized software and research and development costs the company accounts for its internal software development costs are in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the company capitalizes software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the product s availability for general release 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to product development expense 
product development expense includes payroll  employee benefits  other headcount related costs associated with product development and any related costs to third parties under sub contracting or net of any collaborative arrangements 
software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis over the greater of the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products beginning with the initial release to customers 
the company s estimated life for its capitalized software products is two years based on current sales trends and the rate of product release 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances had occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of the capitalized software development costs should be revised or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on the estimated future revenues of each product 
we believe that our estimate of our capitalized software costs and the period for their amortization is critical because of the significance of our balance of capitalized software costs relative to our total assets 
potential impairment is determined by comparing the balance of unamortized capitalized software costs to the sales revenue projected for a capitalized software project 
if efforts to sell that software project are terminated  or if the projected sales revenue from that software project drops below a level that is less than the unamortized balance  then an impairment would be recognized 
goodwill part of the purchase price for the fieldcentrix assets  acquired september   included the acquisition of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of september it is also tested between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exists  using a fair value based approach 
the valuation of goodwill uses two commonly accepted valuation methods  the market and income approaches 
the market approach analyzed the market valuations of similar companies based on recent market conditions 
the income approach analyzed the company s expectation for future results based on current and expected economic conditions 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  the company determines the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques  including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis an income approach 
the comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are generally the members of our peer group 
the impairment test must be performed more frequently if there are triggering events  as for example when the company s market capitalization significantly declines for a sustained period  which could cause the company to do interim impairment testing that might result in an impairment to goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of revenue  operating income  depreciation and amortization  and capital expenditures 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual financial results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge 
acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
share based compensation option plans beginning on january   the company began accounting for stock options under the provision of sfas r  share based payment  which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation 
the fair value of stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes closed form option valuation model 
this model requires the input of assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award 
we elected the modified prospective method for adoption of sfas r 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock option awards under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated condensed financial statements were estimated using a black scholes closed form option valuation model to determine the estimated value and by attributing such fair value over the requisite service period on a straight line basis for those awards that actually vested 
the adoption of sfas r has impacted our consolidated statement of operations through the recognition of share based compensation expenses in cost of services and maintenance  development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
future periods are expected to reflect similar costs 
prior to the adoption of sfas r no stock based compensation cost had been recorded 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence which includes  among other things  our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have a stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  against which we provided a valuation allowance 
our net deferred tax assets were generated primarily by operating losses 
accordingly  it is more likely than not  that we will not realize these assets through future operations 
on january   we implemented the provisions of fas interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
estimated interest is recorded as a component of interest expense and penalties are recorded as a component of general and administrative expense 
such amounts were not material for  and the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position 
in  the israel taxing authority ita notified the company that it intends to re examine a transaction that it had previously approved 
the company is vigorously defending itself in court and based on information to date  does not expect this issue to result in any additional tax to the company

in accordance with relevant accounting pronouncements  the company recorded the preferred stock on the company s consolidated balance sheet within stockholders equity 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 increasing rate preferred stock  the preferred stock is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount of net proceeds received less an imputed dividend cost 
the imputed dividend cost of  was the result of the preferred stock having a dividend rate during the first two years after its issuance that is lower than the rate that becomes fixed after the initial two year period 
the imputed dividend cost of  will be amortized over the first two years from the date of issuance and is based upon the present value of the dividend discount using a yield 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  determination of useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the intent of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset determined under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r 
fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the implementation of fsp to have a material impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

fas is effective sixty days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not expect the implementation of fas to have a material impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
revised  business combinations fas r which replaces fas no  business combinations 
fas r retains the underlying concepts of fas in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but fas r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
changes prescribed by fas r include  but are not limited to  requirements to expense transaction costs and costs to restructure acquired entities  record earn outs and other forms of contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date  record of the net assets acquired even if less than a controlling interest is acquired  and to recognize any excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase consideration as a gain to the acquirer 
fas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
fas r amends fas such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of fas r would also apply the provisions of fas r 
early adoption is not allowed 
once effective  this standard will be applied to all future business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements fas 
fas amends accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
fas also clarifies that all of those transactions resulting in a change in ownership of a subsidiary are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary 
fas requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent s owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary 
fas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
fas shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements 
the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
at this time  the company does not have any non controlling interests in any subsidiaries 
if such an interest is obtained in the future  the company will apply the rules of the standard as appropriate 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 

sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to understand more easily the effect on earnings of a company s choice to use fair value 
it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  there has been no material impact to our reporting as a result of adopting the standard 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas effective november  under this standard  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the company has investments that are valued in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the company has the ability to access 
level valuations based inputs on other than quoted prices included within level  for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
on december  the fair value for the company s investments was determined based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  selected financial data and the percentages of the company s total revenues represented by each line item presented for the periods presented years ended december  revenues software license fees services and maintenance total revenues costs and expenses cost of software license fees cost of services and maintenance product development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses net loss income comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  software license revenues decreased in  compared to services and maintenance fees for amounted to  an decrease from software license fee revenues decreased  or to  in from  in astea alliance license revenues decreased to   in from  in  a decrease of 
the overall decrease is attributable to a significant decline in license sales in all regions of the world in which the company operates which resulted from the economic slowdown affecting the entire world at this time 
the timing of the sales cycle has also been extended contributing to the decline in license revenue 
the company also sold  of fieldcentrix licenses compared to  in the company did not have any license revenue in from its existing dispatch customers compared to  in total services and maintenance revenues decreased  or to  in from  in part of the decrease is attributable to the recognition in of  of astea alliance service and maintenance revenues related to a uk contract in which revenue was deferred from and in addition   of service and maintenance revenue was also recognized in for services performed in and but deferred due to the sales including certain undelivered analytical modules 
there was also a decrease in service and maintenance revenue of  from the company s fieldcentrix customer base 
the decrease in fieldcentrix service and maintenance revenue resulted from a decrease in both headcount and the decrease in fieldcentrix license sales which impacted both implementation and pilot projects 
dispatch service and maintenance revenues decreased to  in from  in due to the decreasing demand for dispatch professional services and the lack of any related product development by the company  the decrease in service and maintenance revenue is expected to continue beyond in no customers represented or more of total revenues 
in  two customers represented and of total revenues 
costs of revenues 
costs of software license fee revenues increased to  in from  in the increase results from increased amortization of capitalized software development costs 
amortization of capitalized software increased to  in from  in the principal reasons for the increase were due to the release of fieldcentrix version at the end of the third quarter of which began amortization in the last quarter of and a full year of amortization from the release of astea alliance version once the new versions were released  the company started to amortize the development costs that had previously been capitalized 
the gross margin percentage on software license sales is in and in the decline in the margin results from the overall decrease in license revenue in and the increase in cost of software license fees 
costs of services and maintenance revenues increased to  in from  in the increase in cost of services and maintenance is primarily attributed to increases in salary expense in the us partially offsetting the salary increase was a decline in share based compensation expense for employees which declined from  in to  in the service and maintenance gross margin percentage decreased to in from in the decreased margin is primarily attributable to a decrease in new projects resulting from lower license sales in product development 
product development expense decreased  or  to  in from  in development costs decreased due to a decreased in headcount in from the same period in additionally   in share based compensation expense for employees was recorded at december  compared to  expense for year ending december  product development as a percentage of total revenue increased to in compared to in this increase in costs relative to expenses is due to the overall decrease in revenues in compared to gross development expense before the capitalization of software costs and was  in  a increase from  in capitalized software totaled  in compared to  in the increase in capitalized software of over last year reflects the intense effort put forth by the company to expand and improve its products 
in  the company released version of its fieldcentrix offering 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or  to  in from  in the decrease is primarily the result of headcount changes during and lower commissions paid due to lower sales in additionally   in share based compensation expense for employees was expensed in compared to  recorded at december  the company continues to focus on improving its market presence through intensified marketing efforts to increase awareness of the company s products 
this occurs through the use of webinars focused in the vertical industries in which the company operates  attendance at selected trade shows  and increased investment in lead generation for its sales force 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in principally resulting from the decrease in revenue in compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries  benefits and related costs for the company s finance  administrative and executive management personnel  legal costs  accounting costs  bad debt expense and various costs associated with the company s status as a public company 
the company s general and administrative expenses were  in and  in expenses in declined  a decrease 
this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in headcount 
partially offsetting the cost decreases was an increase of  in share based compensation expense for employees in compared to as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses amounted to in compared to in the increase in expenses previously described relative to revenues primarily results from the decrease in revenues 
interest income 
net interest income decreased  to  in from  in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in interest rates in compared to as well as reduced funds invested 
income tax expense 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on the company s current year and historical operating losses  the company determined maintaining a full valuation allowance was appropriate 
the company made a provision of  in both and also  for income taxes which resulted from a difference between an indefinite lived asset  goodwill  which is amortized for tax  but not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
international operations 
total revenues from the company s international operations decreased  or to  in from  in part of the decrease in revenue from international operations was attributable to the recognition in of  in license  service and maintenance revenues which had been deferred from a transaction that occurred with a uk customer in and continued through excluding the revenue recognized in from the uk customer that had been deferred from previous years  total revenue from international operations was  which would reflect a decrease in international revenues in over the same period in the decrease in revenues results from a significant decrease in both license revenue and professional services in europe as well as a decline in license revenue in the asia pacific region 
overall  international operations generated a net loss of  for compared to net profit of  in international operating costs increased by  due to higher cost of services and maintenance resulting from increased professional service work in our pacific location 
the decrease in international net income of  is the direct result of the decrease in service and maintenance revenues and the recognition of deferred revenues from through for which all related costs had been recognized in prior years 
net income loss 
the company generated a net loss of  for the year ended december  compared to net income of  in the decrease of  is primarily the result of a decrease in revenues which approximates the change in earnings 
the decrease in revenues is due to the failure to close license deals due to the slowing economy in as well as the recognition of  of revenue in deferred from and related to certain undelivered modules and specified upgrade that were delivered in liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   an increase of  over the year ended december  in which  of cash was generated by operations 
the increase was primarily attributable in a decrease in accounts receivable in which generated  of cash compared to  an increase in depreciation and amortization of  a reduction in recognized deferred revenues of  compared to and a reduction in prepaid expenses of  compared to the significant reduction in deferred revenues occurred due to the deferral of license  professional services and maintenance revenues at december  resulting from undelivered elements  all of which were delivered in and accordingly recognized in partially offsetting these increases in cash flow from operations are increased uses of cash consisting of a swing in net loss of  which resulted from a loss of  in compared to income of  in and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  investing activities the company used  of cash for investing activities in compared to using  in the increase in cash used for investing activities of  results from an increase in property and equipment purchases of  and an increase in capitalized software development costs of  in the increase in cash outflows in were partially offset by the reduction of acquisition costs payments related to the earn out provision on the purchase of fieldcentrix
