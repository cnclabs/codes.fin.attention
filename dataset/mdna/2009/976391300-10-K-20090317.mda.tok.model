overview we are a real estate investment trust engaged in the business of owning real property and real estate related assets 
our business objective is to maximize long term shareholder value through a total return value approach to real estate investing 
we seek to achieve this objective by acquiring investments with both recurring cash flow in order to sustain our dividend  along with investments that we believe to have appreciation potential 
we operate in three strategic business segments i operating properties  ii loan assets and loan securities  and iii reit equity and debt securities 
we acquire assets through direct ownership as well as through strategic alliances and ventures  and have entered into two significant venture arrangements 
our venture with marc realty  a chicago area real estate company  is our primary vehicle for investments in the chicago metropolitan area 
in addition  since its formation in march  we have acquired substantially all of our loan assets and loan securities through concord and lex win concord  a owned joint venture with lexington 
as of december   we held interests in approximately million rentable square feet of office  retail  multi tenant and mixed use space through our wholly owned operating properties and our ventures with marc realty and sealy 
as of december  our properties were approximately leased 
our primary sources of revenue are rental income and tenant recoveries from leases of our operating properties  interest income from our loan assets and loan securities  and interest and dividend income from our investments in reit securities 
the comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by several items including i the timing of our property acquisition and leasing activities ii the purchases and sales of assets and investments  and iii results of our ventures 
the weakness in the economy since late and the subsequent disruption of the capital and credit markets throughout has affected profitability and limited the availability of financing and the ability to raise equity capital 
during we focused our attention primarily on maximizing our liquidity and reducing our exposure to short term debt  particularly at concord 
with respect to our debt exposure  each of our investment platforms and investments is essentially a stand alone business  such that any potential problems or liabilities which might occur are limited to that specific platform or investment 
consequently  our exposure is in each case limited to our equity in that particular investment and not to us as a whole 
inclusive of extension rights  we have no secured debt maturities in  with  of scheduled principal paydowns in the remaining balance of approximately  is scheduled to be paid down or mature in or later 
at december  we held  in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and  in equity and debt reit securities  including  attributable to lexington common and preferred shares 
in addition  we had the ability to draw up to  on our credit facility with keybank 
the weakening economy and capital and credit market deterioration has had its most immediate impact on concord 
the market in which these loan securities trade has effectively evaporated 
in addition  the need for liquidity by those entities that trade loan securities has caused the current values of loan securities to have significantly decreased 
as a result of these decreases  substantial other than temporary impairments amounting to  for have been recorded by concord 
additionally  with the lack of available financing in the market  the likelihood of loan defaults has increased  with three loans held by concord currently being in default 
accordingly  concord has taken loan loss reserves of  for to the extent that the current weakness in the economy and or the capital and credit market deterioration continues  it is possible that additional other than temporary impairments and loan loss reserves will be required to be recognized by concord 
concord s activities are discussed below under the section titled concord and lex win concord 
at december  we determined that  as the result of current market conditions  including the changes in interest rate spreads and lack of financing available  the fair value of our equity investment in concord was below the carrying value 
accordingly  we assessed whether this decline in value was other than temporary 
in making this determination  we considered the length of time and extent to which the decline has occurred  the lack of indication by the credit markets as to when there will be a recovery  the expectation that concord will not pay distributions to us in the near future and the cash position of concord 
we determined the fair value of concord utilizing a leveraged cash flow methodology whereby cash flows were projected through  the expected term of the cdo those cash flows were then modified based on changes to varying assumptions and cash flow scenarios were calculated 
each cash flow scenario was discounted at various market rates of return and a probability was assigned to each scenario 
based on the foregoing  all of which requires significant judgment  we concluded that the decline in value is other than temporary  and we have recognized an impairment loss of  which has reduced our carrying value of this investment to  capital and credit market deterioration as the capital and credit market deterioration has worsened  we have performed additional assessments to determine our exposure to bankruptcies  limited availability of financing and equity offerings  the decline in stock prices in general and reits in particular and declining values for our loan assets and loan securities 
we have further reviewed our risk associated with counterparties to our hedging instruments and credit facilities 
we believe our greatest risk to operating results and liquidity is the recent unprecedented volatility in capital and credit markets  which may create additional risks in the upcoming years 
a continued weakness in the economy could further impair our ability to raise future capital through equity and debt offerings  thereby requiring us to obtain additional capital through other means 
further  the declining availability of financing has had  and will likely continue to have  an impact on our ability to finance additional acquisitions and  ultimately  the value of real estate generally 
the inability of borrowers to obtain replacement financing could lead to more loan defaults and or negotiated extensions to existing loans beyond their current expirations 
in addition  tenant defaults at our operating properties and the properties underlying our portfolios could negatively impact our operating property and real estate loan asset and loan security business segments 
we have historically used the public equity markets and secured financing as our primary source of capital 
we expect to continue to fund our investments through one or a combination of cash reserves  borrowings under our credit facility  property loans  or the issuance of debt or equity 
in addition  as our investments mature in value to the point where we may be unlikely to achieve better than market returns  we may exit the investment and redeploy the capital to what we believe to be higher yielding opportunities 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments and other general business needs 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in the short term 
we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility and issuance of equity and debt securities  as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required for our investment activities 
as a reit  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income 
as a result of this dividend requirement  we  like other reits  are unable to reinvest all of our operating cash flow and are dependent on raising capital through equity and debt issuances or forming ventures with institutional or high net worth investors to obtain funds with which to expand our business 
our primary sources of funds include the use of cash and cash equivalents  rents and reimbursements received from our operating properties  payments received under our loan assets and loan securities  the issuance of equity and debt securities  interest and dividends received from investments in reit securities  cash distributions from joint ventures  borrowings under our credit facilities  and asset specific borrowings 
cash flows our level of liquidity based upon cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately  during the year ended december  the trust s cash flow activities are summarized as follows in thousands net cash flow provided by operating activities net cash flow provided by investing activities net cash flow used in financing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  was comprised of a net increase due to adjustments for non cash items of  and a net increase due to changes in other operating assets and liabilities of  which were partially offset by a net loss of  see our discussion of our results of operations below for additional details on our operations 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities of  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of the following  of proceeds received from repayment of our fannie mae and freddie mac whole pool mortgage backed securities available for sale   of proceeds from the sale of real estate securities primarily from the sale of million shares of lexington stock in march   of proceeds from our preferred equity investments in the marc realty portfolio   of return of capital distributions from our equity investments  and  of collections of loans receivable 
these contributions to investing cash flows were offset primarily by  to purchase real estate securities   to issue new loans receivable   for investment in our concord venture and  for investment a sealy venture for the acquisition of a six building office complex in atlanta  georgia  and  for investment in our preferred equity investment in the marc realty portfolio 
financing activities cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of the following  for repayment of borrowings under repurchase agreements relating to our fannie mae and freddie mac whole pool mortgage backed securities   for repayment of borrowings on our revolving line of credit   for dividend payments on our common shares   for the redemption of  preferred shares and  as a deposit for the redemption of an additional  preferred shares   for mortgage loan repayments  and  to increase restricted cash held in escrow 
these decreases to financing cash flows were offset primarily by  of proceeds from our revolving line of credit   of proceeds from the issuance of common shares through a rights offering   of note payable proceeds for the acquisition of available for sale securities  and  of proceeds from our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
significant financial transactions during and early include on january  we acquired  of our preferred shares with a liquidation value of  for  in cash  representing a discount to their liquidation value  on december  we made a  unsecured working capital loan to lex win concord  which was repaid in january  on december  we sold a  square foot shopping center asset located in biloxi  mississippi for net proceeds of  pursuant to our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  during we issued  common shares resulting in gross proceeds of on october and november  we acquired a total of  of our preferred shares for approximately  in cash  representing a discount from their liquidation value of on october  we acquired million shares of lexington common shares for  and obtained seller non recourse financing equal to of the purchase price  which financing has a term of three years  bears interest at a rate of month libor plus basis points and requires margin calls only at such time as the loan amount equals or exceeds of the value of the shares  in september our board of trustees approved a stock repurchase plan pursuant to which we may acquire up to  of our common shares 
through december  we have acquired  of our common shares for  in cash  in august lex win acquisition sold all of its shares of piedmont office realty trust for an aggregate price of  the trust received a distribution of its pro rata share of  in connection with the sale  on august  we acquired  through a venture with sealy  a six building office flex campus containing approximately  square feet in northwest atlanta  georgia 
the purchase price for the property was  inclusive of assumed debt 
the venture assumed an existing  first mortgage loan encumbering the property which matures in november our initial percentage ownership in the venture is  on august  we and lexington restructured our investment in concord  admitting inland as a member in concord with a redeemable preferred membership interest 
inland contributed  to concord and agreed to contribute up to an additional  inland s contributions are to be used primarily for additional investments by concord  and if inland agrees  to satisfy any future margin calls or prepayments on concord s credit facilities 
in connection with its investment in concord  inland is entitled to receive a priority return of on its contributed and unreturned capital 
inland has made additional contributions of  through december   used primarily to repay maturing debt agreements at concord  through december  we and lexington have contributed  to concord   of which was contributed by the trust during for the year ended december  we received a distribution of  from concord  on july  we made a  mezzanine loan on a newly acquired property in the marc realty portfolio

dividends since december we have paid regular dividends to our shareholders 
in paying dividends we have always sought to have our dividends track cash flow from operations  both recurring and nonrecurring 
as a result  while we intend to continue paying dividends each quarter  future dividend declarations will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on the actual cash flow of the trust  its financial condition  capital requirements  the distribution requirements for reits under the code and such other factors as our board of trustees deem relevant 
subject to the foregoing  we expect to continue distributing our current cash flow after reserving normal and customary amounts thereby allowing us to maintain our capital 
toward that end  the board of trustees elected to reduce our dividend to per share for the first quarter of  which represents a reduction from per share for the first quarter of this represents our existing budgeted recurring cash flow generated by assets currently owned and excludes any potential cash flow from our investment in concord  as well as potential future cash flow generated from the investment of the substantial cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we expect to continue applying these standards with respect to our dividends on a quarterly basis which could cause the dividends to increase or decrease depending on cash flow 
we paid regular quarterly dividends of per common share and per series b preferred share for all four quarters of we declared a special dividend of per common share in december  which was paid in january contractual obligations the following table summarizes our payment obligations under contractual obligations  including all fixed and variable rate debt obligations  except as otherwise noted  as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years mortgage loans payable principal and interest revolving line of credit principal and interest note payable repurchase agreements ground lease obligations advisors fee balance includes a mortgage loan payable with an outstanding principal balance at december  of  on which we have two one year options to extend 
note payable to citibank made in connection with the trust s acquisition of million shares of lexington common stock for the underlying lease agreements require the tenant to pay the ground rent expense 
base management fee based upon the terms of the advisory agreement  as amended in  with no effect given to equity issuances after december  or to incentive fee compensation to fur advisors 
no amounts have been included for subsequent renewal periods of the advisory agreement 
we carry comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance i fire  ii flood  iii extended coverage  iv acts of terrorism  as defined in the terrorism risk insurance act of  and v rental loss insurance with respect to our operating properties where coverage is not provided by our net lease tenants 
under the terms of our net leases  the tenant is obligated to maintain adequate insurance coverage 
our debt instruments  consisting of mortgage loans secured by our operating properties which are generally non recourse to us contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance 
although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage under these agreements  we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
further  if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain at reasonable costs  it could adversely affect our ability to finance and or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio

the disruption in the capital and credit markets increased margin calls on concord s repurchase agreements 
furthermore  the ability to issue cdos and the availability of new financing has effectively been eliminated  making the execution of concord s strategy unfeasible at this time 
consequently  concord will focus on the recovery of its member s equity by maximizing the value of its existing assets and toward that end  has worked to increase its liquidity and reduce exposure to maturing debt 
lex win concord began experiencing declines in the fair value of its loan securities in the fourth quarter of consistent with liquidity concerns impacting the commercial bond and real estate markets and the overall economy 
as a result of a significant decline in the fair value of three cdo bonds and management s concern regarding the ultimate collectability of amounts due for such securities  the company recorded other than temporary impairment charges of approximately  during the fourth quarter of during lex win concord observed an increased uncertainty in the commercial bond and real estate markets as well as a lack of liquidity impacting the overall financial markets 
as a result  lex win concord saw an accelerating decline throughout the year in the fair value of its available for sale securities 
management assesses the prospects of the loans and collateral underlying the securities credit versus market issues as well as its intent and ability to hold the securities until a forecasted recovery of fair value or maturity  and other factors 
based upon these considerations  management determined such impairment of its available for sale securities to be other than temporary and recorded an impairment loss for available for sale securities of  for the year ended december  lex win concord evaluates its portfolio of available for sale debt securities for other than temporary impairment in accordance with eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets eitf  fasb statement no

determining whether a security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment 
management considers both quantitative and qualitative factors  including those described in sfas and sec staff accounting bulletin topic m  other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities sab topic m 
among other things  this evaluation includes consideration of the length of time and extent to which the fair value of a security has been less than its cost basis  lex win concord s intent and ability to hold the securities until a forecasted recovery in value and the financial prospects of the loans and collateral underlying the securities 
if  based on these and other considerations  management determines that impairment is other than temporary in nature  lex win concord recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the investment s cost basis and its fair value 
lex win concord recognizes income on its portfolio of loan securities in accordance with eitf subject to various requirements  discounts attributable to previously recognized other than temporary impairment charges are recognized in interest income on the effective interest method based upon the excess of all estimated prospective cash flows over the investment balance in the loan security at the measurement date 
lex win concord will accrete certain impairment discounts over the remaining life of the securities using the effective interest method 
during the year ended december   lex win concord recognized accretion of previous other than temporary impairment discounts totaling  lex win concord did not recognize in earnings any material amounts relating to the accretion of other than temporary impairment charges for the years ended december  and the period march  inception through december  in december lex win concord adopted fasb staff position eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no

lex win concord has adopted and applied fsp as of december  which did not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
additionally  the decline in values of loan assets and securities resulted in significant margin calls under lex win concord s repurchase facilities

these amounts were repaid in january  and the increase in other liabilities is primarily due to a change in the value of financial derivative instruments 
the value of the interest swaps utilized by concord was  at december  compared to  at december  the increase in the liabilities was the result of declining interest rates 
keybank credit facility on march  concord entered into a  secured revolving credit facility with keybank 
the credit facility enables concord to finance existing unlevered assets as well as new assets acquired by concord 
the initial maximum borrowings under the loan are  borrowings under the facility bear interest at spreads over libor ranging from to  depending on the underlying loan asset or loan security for which such borrowing is made

on february   concord received from keybank a waiver of the covenant violation 
in addition  the covenant will be waived until june  repurchase facilities concord has financed certain of its loan assets and loan securities through credit facilities in the form of repurchase agreements 
in the repurchase agreements entered into by concord to date the lender  referred to as the repurchase counterparty  purchases the loan asset or loan security from or on behalf of concord 
concord then repurchases the loan asset or loan security in cash on a specific repurchase date or  at the election of concord  an earlier date 
while the loan asset is held by the repurchase counterparty  the repurchase counterparty retains a portion of each interest payment made on such loan asset or loan security equal to the price differential which is effectively the interest rate on the purchase price paid the repurchase counterparty to concord for the loan asset or loan security  with the balance of such payments being paid to concord 
pursuant to the terms of the repurchase agreements  if the market value of the loan assets or loan securities pledged or sold by concord decline  which decline is determined  in most cases  by the repurchase counterparty  concord may be required to provide additional collateral or pay down a portion of the funds advanced 
during  concord was required to pay down an aggregate of  against  of outstanding repurchase obligations 
concord satisfied these amounts with cash flow  borrowing under its keybank credit facility and capital contributions from inland 
all of concord s repurchase facilities are recourse to concord and require concord to maintain certain loan to asset value ratios  a minimum net worth and minimum liquidity 
in addition  all of the repurchase facilities require that concord pay down borrowings under these facilities as principal payments on the loan assets and loan securities pledged to these facilities are received

critical accounting policies and estimates impairment we routinely evaluate the carrying value of our operating properties  loan assets  loan securities and investments 
we evaluate the need for an impairment loss on a real estate asset when indicators of impairment are present and the projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are not sufficient to recover the asset s carrying amount 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
the projection of cash flows used in the impairment evaluation involves significant judgment by management 
in december we recorded a  impairment on our andover  massachusetts property as a result of indications from our existing tenant that it will not renew its lease  due to expire in december there were no property impairments recorded for the years ended december  and we also invest in mezzanine loans 
in connection with these mezzanine loans  we may also acquire an ownership interest in the borrower that allows us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flow from operations as well as proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management determines whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  preferred equity  venture or as real estate 
this requires management judgment in evaluating the substance of the investment 
the loan classification impacts the timing and amount of income recognized from the investment 
we currently classify all of our mezzanine loans  where we also acquire an ownership interest in the borrower and receive a preferred return as preferred equity investments 
during  an other than temporary impairment was recorded on our mezzanine investment on our lansing  michigan property 
additionally  we recorded an other than temporary impairment on our mezzanine investments on a three building suburban office complex in schaumburg  illinois 
determining whether a mezzanine investment is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment 
this evaluation includes consideration of the length of time and extent to which the fair value of an investment has been less than its cost basis  our intent and ability to hold the mezzanine investments until a forecasted recovery in value and the collateral underlying the mezzanine investments 
as a result of this other than temporary impairment  we recognized a loss from preferred equity investments of  there were no other than temporary impairments recorded on our preferred equity investments for the years ended december  and in addition  our loan assets are periodically evaluated for possible impairment in order to determine whether it is necessary to establish a loan loss reserve 
in some instances  if a borrower is experiencing difficulties making loan payments  we may assist the borrower to address the problems  which could include extending the loan term  making additional advances  or reducing required payments 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the trust will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms of the loan 
impairment is then measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the trust will establish a reserve for loan losses and record a corresponding charge to earnings 
significant judgments are required in determining impairment 
the trust does not record interest income on impaired loans 
any cash receipts on impaired loans are recorded as a recovery reducing the reserve for loan losses 
during the trust recorded a  provision for loss on loans receivable related to four of its loans 
the trust recorded a provision for loss on loans receivable of  and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we invest in reit securities which are classified as available for sale securities 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security is established 
the determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment 
factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the issuer s earnings performance  credit rating  asset quality  business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates  length of time that the fair value has been below our cost  our expected future cash flows from the security and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
judgments associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions  which could differ from our assessment 
during and  we determined that certain securities had sustained other than temporary impairments and  as a result  we recognized impairment losses of  and  respectively 
there were no impairment losses recorded for the year ended december  our equity and venture investments are reviewed for impairment  periodically  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of our equity investments is dependent on a number of factors including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
in december we recorded an impairment loss of  related to our investment in lex win concord 
finally  estimates are used when accounting for the allowance for contingent liabilities and other commitments 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
all of the estimates and evaluations are susceptible to change and actual results could differ from the estimates and evaluations 
variable interest entities the trust has evaluated its loans and investments to determine whether they are variable interests in a variable interest entity vie 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r requires a vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that incurs a majority of the vie s anticipated losses and or a majority of its expected returns 
in december the company adopted fasb staff position fas and fin r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities fsp fas and finr 
among other things  fsp fas and finr require enhanced disclosures with respect to variable interest entities to provide financial statement users with an understanding of the significant judgments and assumptions made by the company in its determination of whether it must consolidate variable interest entities 
at december  we have identified six convertible mezzanine loans related to the marc realty portfolio to be variable interests in a vie 
we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the underlying borrowing entities of these six mezzanine loans as we do not anticipate absorbing a majority of the expected losses due to our preferred return position 
these loans  with a carrying value of  net of other than temporary impairment losses of  are accounted for as preferred equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
recently issued accounting standards see item financial statements note item a quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow management to mitigate the potential negative effects of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flow and earnings 
our liabilities include both fixed and variable rate debt 
as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  we seek to limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations through match financing on our loan assets and loan securities as well as through hedging transactions 
in this regard  we entered into the following agreements an interest rate swap with a  notional amount that effectively converted the interest rate on that portion of principal of our note payable to keybank from a floating rate equal to libor plus to a fixed rate of 
we made a  prepayment on keybank s floating rate debt during the second quarter of as a result  we settled a portion of the existing interest rate swap with a notional amount of  for  resulting in an unrealized gain which will be amortized to income over the remaining life of the swap 
the outstanding balance at december  on this loan is approximately  the fair value of our debt  based on discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt  exceeded its carrying value by  at december  and was less than its carrying value by  at december  the following table shows what the annual effect a change in the libor rate would have on interest expense based upon the unhedged balances in variable rate debt at december  in thousands change in libor change in consolidated interest expense pro rata share of change in interest expense of debt on non consolidated entities minority partners share increase decrease in net income represents our pro rata share of a change in interest expense in our equity investment concord 
the one month libor rate at december  was 
we believe that due to our significant investment in a non consolidated entity concord  the presentation of our pro rata share of a change in interest expense from this entity is important to fully understand our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the potential negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings  including hedging strategies  depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
in addition  as of december  our pro rata share of lex win concord s variable rate mortgage loan assets and loan securities with a face value aggregating  partially mitigate our exposure to change in interest rates 
market value risk our hedge transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the three counterparties of these arrangements are credit suisse international  keybank national association and bear stearns capital management 
we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that we will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related assets incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies
