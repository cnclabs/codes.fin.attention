item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary overall  our operating results declined in compared with the previous year as sales and gross margins were below levels while selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of engineering and product development initiatives 
consequently  we reported a net loss for  versus net income for as a result of our additional investment in engineering and new product development  however  we have launched our new kng line of p digital products  introducing the first three models  each in three different frequency bands 
two of these bands open to us markets that we have not been able to address previously 
we anticipate introducing additional new products in this line in and beyond 
sales decreased as procurement activity from our principal customers  particularly those in federal government agencies declined from the previous year 
we believe this trend is consistent with overall federal lmr procurements as indicated in publicly available reports 
sales to business and commercial customers decreased as well 
total sales for were approximately million compared with million last year 
sales of p digital products totaled approximately million for compared with million last year 
lower gross margins in versus were a reflection of a less favorable mix of product sales and lower manufacturing volumes 
although we reduced selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses in compared with  we increased engineering and product development expenses related to our new kng line of p products 
the increase in these expenses more than offset reductions in selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses  which resulted in higher combined selling  general and administrative expenses in versus we reported a pre tax loss of million in compared with pre tax income of million in a tax benefit of million was realized for  compared with tax expense of million for we realized a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  for  compared with net income of million  or per basic share and per fully diluted share  for as of december   we had million in cash and million of working capital  and long term debt of million 
results of operations as an aid to understanding our operating results  the following table shows items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percent of sales percent of sales for years ended december sales cost of products gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses net interest income other income expense loss income before income tax expense income loss taxes benefit expense net loss income fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net sales in our primary markets of government and public safety and commercial  business and industrial declined in compared with the prior year 
net sales for totaled million compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
sales of p digital products in were million  or of total sales  compared with million or of sales for purchases by our largest legacy customers suffered throughout as these federal agencies struggled with funding and contract issues which impacted both our total sales and p digital sales 
additionally  the initial products in our new kng line of p digital radios were introduced later in the year which limited our effectiveness in penetrating and realizing sales to agencies or other organizations that have not previously been customers 
in our new kng line  we have now completed and introduced p digital products operating in vhf  uhf  and mhz 
we have never before had p digital uhf or mhz products in our portfolio 
we believe these products will expand our addressable market and enhance our future prospects for sales growth 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for was compared with in changes in our cost of products are primarily related to the mix of products sold and manufacturing volumes 
in  sales of higher margin products declined from the previous year 
also  due to lower total sales  our manufacturing volumes decreased 
accordingly  we did not fully utilize and absorb our base of manufacturing expenses 
the combination of these factors increased overall product costs and decreased gross margins 
in response to these conditions  during we took steps to adjust operations and reduce related expenses 
we continue to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
furthermore  we regularly evaluate contract manufacturing alternatives to improve quality  responsiveness  and cost 
we anticipate that the current contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future 
we believe as sales grow  particularly those of p digital products  we should realize improved production efficiencies  and gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a consist of sales  marketing  commissions  engineering  product development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters expenses and non cash share based employee compensation expenses 
for  sg a expenses totaled approximately million or of sales compared with approximately million or or sales 
engineering and product development expenses in increased by approximately million  or of sales  to million compared with million in this increase was entirely driven by the application of additional variable engineering resources to speed the completion and introduction of products of our new line of p digital radios 
during and the first quarter of  we completed and introduced new p digital radios operating in the vhf  uhf  and mhz frequencies 
the models operating in uhf and mhz frequencies are particularly important because such products have never before been part of our product line  and therefore we have not previously been able to address opportunities in these portions of the market 
we believe these products expand our addressable market and should be a source of sales growth in the future 
we anticipate developing more products in the line in and beyond 
comple ting these products and bringing them to market will continue to require investment 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by approximately  or of sales  to million compared with million for the previous year 
this decline was primarily due to reduced commissions from lower sales 
also  responding to lower sales  we reduced sales and marketing payroll and related expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  or of sales  to million compared with million for the previous year 
this was primarily attributed to reductions in professional fees and headquarters expenses 
operating income we reported an operating loss of approximately million for  compared with operating income of million last year 
during  total sales decreased and the mix of product sales was less favorable  with the decline in sales of higher margin p digital products  compared with last year 
these factors combined to adversely impact operating income 
interest income  net for  we earned approximately  in net interest income compared to  for the prior year 
we earn interest income on our cash balances and incur interest expense on borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
the decline in net interest income is derived from our lower cash position  which resulted primarily from our operating loss in as well as the payment in the fourth quarter of a cash dividend of per share of common stock 
also  interest rates declined in compared with the previous year 
we had million outstanding under the revolving line of credit as of december  the interest rate on such revolving line of credit is variable based on the prime rate plus basis points 
income taxes income tax benefit for totaled approximately million compared with tax expense of million for the prior year 
the benefit and expense for each year is largely non cash as a result of our deferred tax asset related primarily to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   our deferred tax asset totaled approximately million 
this asset is primarily composed of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
these nols are available for federal and state purposes  and expire starting in in order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset  we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years prior to the expiration of our nols 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset 
the recognition of the net deferred tax asset and related tax benefit is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  our estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  our current and anticipated customers  contracts and product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and and certain tax planning strategies 
we have evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
from our evaluation we have concluded that based on the weight of available evidence we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets recorded at december  we cannot presently estimate what  if any  changes to the valuation of our deferred tax asset may be deemed appropriate in the future 
if we incur future losses  it may be necessary to record an additional valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset recorded as of december  fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net net sales for decreased by approximately million to approximately million from approximately million for  with sales declining in both of our markets 
the decline was attributed primarily to the government and public safety market  which comprised approximately of total sales for the year 
sales of p digital products decreased to million  or of total sales  compared with million  or of total sales  for the prior year 
our customers in this market were impacted by budget and funding constraints  as the federal government operated without an approved budget throughout the year 
these circumstances resulted in reduced procurement activity from our largest existing customer agencies 
we successfully penetrated new federal and state agencies during the year 
the funding environment  however  limited their impact on product sales 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for increased to from last year 
the cost of products includes non cash share based employee compensation expense totaling approximately  of sales and  of sales for and  respectively 
changes in our cost of products are primarily related to product mix and manufacturing volume 
during  particularly during the first and fourth quarters  sales of p digital products and higher margin analog products were lower and comprised a smaller portion of reduced total sales compared to the previous year 
also  with reduced total sales  manufacturing volumes decreased  and therefore we did not fully utilize and absorb our base of manufacturing and support expenses 
these factors combined to increase product costs as a percentage of sales and decrease gross margins 
we continue to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
we also regularly consider manufacturing alternatives to improve quality  speed and to reduce our product costs 
we anticipate that the current contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of marketing  sales  commissions  engineering  development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters  and non cash share based employee compensation expenses

engineering and product development expenses in decreased by approximately  compared to last year 
this decrease was primarily non cash share based employee compensation expense recorded the prior year 
the cost necessary to execute our p new product development plans will continue 
our development program is intended to enhance our position by designing additional p digital products with competitive advantages 
marketing and selling expenses decreased by approximately  for compared to last year 
this decrease was primarily the result of sales commission expenses  which declined directly as a result of lower sales revenues 
this was partially offset by the addition of direct sales staff and related sales and marketing expenses  all of which are designed to raise and enhance our profile  penetrate new customers and drive sales growth  particularly from government and public safety opportunities for p digital products 
general and administrative expenses for increased by approximately  compared to last year 
increases in costs associated primarily with the implementation of a new enterprise wide computer system  property insurance  public company and other headquarters related expenses were partially offset by decreases in non cash share based employee compensation expenses 
operating income operating income for decreased approximately million compared to last year 
during  total sales decreased and the mix of product sales was less favorable  with the decline in sales of higher margin p digital products  compared to last year 
these factors combined to adversely impact operating income 
interest income  net for  we earned approximately  in net interest income compared to  for the prior year 
we earn interest income on our cash balances and would incur interest expense on borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
the increase in net interest income is derived from our improved cash position throughout the year compared to last year 
also  we had no borrowings outstanding at any time during under our revolving lines of credit 
income taxes income tax expense for totaled approximately million compared to million for the prior year

liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for the previous year 
cash used in operating activities for was largely the result of capitalized software and a net loss for the year  as well as an increase in inventory 
during  we incurred approximately million for software development associated with our new kng line of p digital products 
there was no comparable investment during the previous year 
we recorded a net loss for totaling approximately million compared to net income of approximately million in net inventories for increased approximately million primarily due to slower than anticipated sales 
for the prior year  net inventories increased approximately million 
for  deferred tax assets increased approximately million as a result of the pretax loss and associated tax benefit 
for the same period last year deferred tax assets decreased by approximately million 
trade receivables at the end of decreased approximately million compared to a decrease of approximately million last year  reflecting lower sales in trade payables as of december  increased approximately million  while remaining flat during the previous year  which reflects greater utilization of payment terms with our suppliers 
depreciation and amortization totaled approximately million for  which is largely unchanged from the previous year 
cash used in investing activities was primarily to fund the acquisition of assets pertaining to the development of our new digital products and manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for were approximately  compared to approximately  for the same period last year 
we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded through our existing cash balance  our revolving line of credit and operating cash flow 
in october  we established a secured revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank svb  while simultaneously terminating a similar credit facility with rbc centura bank 
the svb facility provides borrowing availability of up to million and is governed by a loan and security agreement entered into between us and svb 
the facility is available on a revolving basis during the period that commenced on october  and ending on october  under the terms and conditions of the loan and security agreement for the facility  advances are generally subject to customary borrowing conditions  including the accuracy of representations and warranties  compliance with financial maintenance and restrictive covenants and the absence of events of default 
for additional information about the terms and conditions of the loan and security agreement  reference is made to note debt of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
advances under the facility will bear interest at a variable rate equal to the prime rate  in effect from time to time  plus basis points  subject to a reduction of basis points anytime our quarterly net income is greater than million 
under the terms and conditions of the loan and security agreement for the facility  advances may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty 
under the terms and conditions of the loan and security agreement for the facility  our obligations are secured by substantially all of our assets  principally accounts receivable and inventory 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the loan and security agreement as of the date of this report 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the facility and approximately  of additional borrowing availability 
our cash balance at december  was approximately million 
we believe these funds combined with anticipated cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our secured revolving credit facility with svb are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
however  although we do not anticipate needing additional capital in the near term  the current financial crisis and adverse economic conditions may limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital  if needed  on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  we face a number of other risks related to the financial crisis that may impact our business  liquidity and financial condition 
for a description of these risks  see item a

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for the fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted sfas for financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company will adopt sfas for the non financial items in in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
united states generally accepted accounting principles has required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure re quirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of asset and liabilities 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of our choice to use fair value on our earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which it has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet

critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected for disclosure our revenue recognition process and our more subjective accounting estimation processes 
these processes affect our reported revenues and current assets and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of relm 
the processes for determining the allowance for collection of trade receivables  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  software development and income taxes  involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on relm s operations and financial position 
revenue sales revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonably assured 
the earnings process is generally complete when the product is shipped by the company or delivered to the customer  depending upon whether the title to the goods  as well as the risks and benefits of ownership are transferred to the customer at point of shipment or point of delivery 
however  sales to the united states government are recognized when the products are delivered 
we periodically review our revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and staff accounting bulletin no 
allowance for collection losses the allowance for collection losses was approximately  on gross trade receivables of approximately million as of december  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of december  because the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of december  cannot be known with certainty as of this report s date  we rely on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have typically been infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being less than of sales 
we maintain a general allowance up to approximately of the gross trade receivables balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but turn out to have such an inability 
currently  our general allowance on trade receivables is approximately of gross receivables 
as revenues and total receivables increase  the allowance balance may also increase 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify those accounts that are more likely than not to have collection problems 
we may reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
excess and obsolete inventory the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory was approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december  the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
because the amount of inventory that we will actually recoup through sales cannot be known with certainty at any particular time  we rely on past sales experience  future sales forecasts  and our strategic business plans 
generally  in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify inventory as having been used or unused during the past year and establish a reserve based upon several factors including but not limited to business forecasts  inventory quantities and historic usage profile 
we also review actual recovery experience on the sale of excess or obsolete inventory in order to assure that the analysis and reserve are reasonab le 
supplemental to the aforementioned analysis  specific inventory items are reviewed individually by management 
based on the review  considering business levels  future prospects  new products and technology changes  the valuation of specific inventory items may be adjusted to reflect an accurate valuation  in the business judgment of management 
management also performs a determination of net realizable value for all finished goods with a selling price below cost 
for all such items  the inventory is valued at not more than the selling price 
software development we account for the costs of software within our products in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  under which certain software costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products 
we determine technological feasibility to be established upon the internal release of a detailed program design as specified by sfas upon the general release of the product to customers  development costs for that product are amortized over periods not exceeding five years  based on the estimated economic life of the product 
net capitalized software costs totaled million as of december  income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for income taxes  as modified by fin deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that impairment of tax assets are more likely than not 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future
