horizon lines overview we believe that we are the nation s leading jones act container shipping and integrated logistics company  accounting for approximately of total us marine container shipments from the continental us to alaska  puerto rico and hawaii  constituting the three non contiguous jones act markets  and to guam and micronesia 
we own or lease vessels  of which are fully qualified 
table of contents jones act vessels  and approximately  cargo containers 
we also provide comprehensive shipping and sophisticated logistics services in our markets 
we have access to terminal facilities in each of our ports  operating our terminals in alaska  hawaii  and puerto rico and contracting for terminal services in our five ports in the continental us and in the ports in guam  hong kong  yantian and taiwan 
we ship a wide spectrum of consumer and industrial items used everyday in our markets  ranging from foodstuffs refrigerated and non refrigerated to household goods and auto parts to building materials and various materials used in manufacturing 
many of these cargos are consumer goods vital to the populations in our markets  thereby providing us with a relatively stable base of demand for our shipping and logistics services 
we have many long standing customer relationships with large consumer and industrial products companies  such as costco wholesale corporation  johnson johnson  lowe s companies  inc  safeway  inc  toyota motor corporation and wal mart stores  inc we also serve several agencies of the us government  including the department of defense and the us postal service 
our customer base is broad and diversified  with our top ten customers accounting for approximately of revenue and our largest customer accounting for approximately of revenue 
the jones act during  over of our revenues were generated from our shipping and logistics services in markets where the marine trade is subject to the coastwise laws of the united states  also known as the jones act  or other us maritime cabotage laws 
the jones act is a long standing cornerstone of us maritime policy 
under the jones act  all vessels transporting cargo between covered us ports must  subject to limited exceptions  be built in the us  registered under the us flag  manned by predominantly us crews  and owned and operated by us organized companies that are controlled and owned by us citizens 
us flagged vessels are generally required to be maintained at higher standards than foreign flagged vessels and are supervised by  as well as subject to rigorous inspections by  or on behalf of the us coast guard  which requires appropriate certifications and background checks of the crew members 
our trade routes between alaska  hawaii and puerto rico and the continental us represent the three non contiguous jones act markets 
vessels operating on these trade routes are required to be fully qualified jones act vessels 
other us maritime laws require vessels operating on the trade routes between guam  a us territory  and us ports to be us flagged and predominantly us crewed  but not us built 
cabotage laws  which reserve the right to ship cargo between domestic ports to domestic vessels  are not unique to the united states  similar laws are common around the world and exist in over countries 
in general  all interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the us falls under the jones act  which is a cabotage law 
we believe the jones act enjoys broad support from president obama and both major political parties in both houses of congress 
we believe that the ongoing war on terrorism has further solidified political support for the jones act  as a vital and dedicated us merchant marine is a cornerstone for a strong homeland defense  as well as a critical source of trained us mariners for wartime support 
market overview and competition the jones act distinguishes the us domestic shipping market from international shipping markets 
given the limited number of existing jones act qualified vessels  the high capital investment and long delivery lead times associated with building a new containership in the us  the substantial investment required in infrastructure and the need to develop a broad base of customer relationships  the markets in which we operate have been less vulnerable to overcapacity and volatility than international shipping markets 

table of contents although the us container shipping industry is affected by general economic conditions  the industry does not tend to be as cyclical as other sectors within the shipping industry 
specifically  most of the cargos shipped via container vessels consist of a wide range of consumer and industrial items as well as military and postal loads 
since many of these types of cargos are consumer goods vital to the populations in our markets  they provide us with a stable base of demand for our shipping and logistics services 
the jones act markets are not as fragmented as international shipping markets 
we are one of only two major container shipping operators currently serving the alaska market  each accounting for approximately of total container loads traveling from the continental us to alaska 
horizon lines and tote serve the alaska market 
we are also only one of two container shipping companies currently serving the hawaii and guam markets with an approximate share of total domestic marine container shipments from the continental us to these markets 
this percentage reflects and shares of total domestic marine container shipments from the continental us to hawaii and guam markets  respectively 
horizon lines and matson navigation co matson serve the hawaii and guam market 
in puerto rico  we are the largest provider of marine container shipping  accounting for approximately of puerto rico s total container loads from the continental us the puerto rico market is currently served by two containership companies  horizon lines and sea star lines sea star 
sea star is an independently operated company majority owned by an affiliate of tote 
two barge operators  crowley and trailer bridge  inc  also currently serve this market 
the us container shipping industry as a whole is experiencing rising customer expectations for real time shipment status information and the on time pick up and delivery of cargo  as customers seek to optimize efficiency through greater management of the delivery process of their products 
commercial and governmental customers are increasingly requiring the tracking of the location and status of their shipments at all times and have developed a strong preference to retrieve information and communicate using the internet 
during  we introduced the reeferplus gps container tracking and shipment monitoring solution for refrigerated ocean containers moving between the continental us and puerto rico 
this innovative solution is designed to improve the visibility and security of high value perishable cargo requiring cold chain logistics  a term used to describe the maintenance of product temperature through the entire transport chain from packing to delivery 
key capabilities of reeferplus gps include gps enabled real time container tracking  in box sensors reporting temperature  atmosphere and security updates via the web  and remote monitoring and adjusting of reefer conditions with one computer click 
during  we established a fully functional intermodal active radio frequency identification rfid solution providing customers in our alaska trade real time shipment visibility during all phases of transit 
the active rfid based real time tracking system  when matched with horizon s industry leading web based event management system  offers shipment visibility and supply chain efficiencies by providing real time detailed shipment information throughout the container s transit from origin loading facility through to final destination 
a broad range of domestic and foreign governmental agencies are also increasingly requiring access to shipping information in automated formats for customs oversight and security purposes 
to ensure on time pick up and delivery of cargo  shipping companies must maintain strict vessel schedules and efficient terminal operations for expediting the movement of containers in and out of terminal facilities 
the departure and arrival of vessels on schedule is heavily influenced by both vessel maintenance standards ie  minimizing mechanical breakdowns and terminal operating discipline 
marine terminal gate and yard efficiency can be enhanced by efficient yard layout  high quality information systems  and streamlined gate processes 
vessel fleet our management team adheres to an effective strategy for the maintenance of our vessels 
early in our year operating history  when we pioneered jones act container shipping  we recognized the vital importance of maintaining our valuable jones act qualified vessels 
our on shore vessel management team carefully manages all of our ongoing regular maintenance and dry docking activity 

table of contents we maintain our vessels according to our own strict maintenance procedures  which meet or exceed us government requirements 
all of our vessels are regulated pursuant to rigorous standards promulgated by the us coast guard and subject to periodic inspection and certification  for compliance with these standards  by the american bureau of shipping  on behalf of the us coast guard 
our procedures protect and preserve our fleet to the highest standards in our industry and enable us to preserve the usefulness of our ships 
during each of the last four years  our vessels have been in operational condition  ready to sail  over of the time when they were required to be ready to sail 
the table below lists our vessel fleet  which is the largest containership fleet within the jones act markets  as of december  our vessel fleet consists of vessels of varying classes and specification  of which are jones act qualified 
of the vessels that are actively deployed  are jones act qualified and five jones act qualified vessels are spare vessels available for seasonal and dry dock needs and to respond to potential new revenue opportunities

we utilize maersk containers to carry a portion of our cargo westbound to hawaii and guam  where the contents of these containers are then unloaded 
we then ship the empty maersk containers onwards to the three ports in asia 
when these vessels arrive in asia  maersk unloads these empty containers and replaces them with loaded containers on our vessels for the return trip to the us west coast 
we achieve significantly greater vessel capacity utilization and revenue on this route as a result of this arrangement 
we do not transport any domestic cargo between the us mainland and hawaii on these vessels 
we do carry some international cargo to and from hawaii for maersk 
we also use maersk equipment on our service to hawaii from our us west coast ports as well as from select us inland locations

horizon logistics horizon logistics offers inland transportation for customers through its own trucking operations on the us west coast and alaska  and it also offers integrated logistics services through relationships with third party truckers  railroads  and barge operators in our markets 
horizon logistics was formed in from the merger of the company s existing logistics operations and the acquisition of aero logistics  a us third party logistics provider specializing in expedited delivery and special projects 
we intend for horizon logistics operations to rely substantially on independent contractors to fulfill the transportation services for most of its shipments 
horizon logistics service offerings are divided into the following categories warehouse and distribution  consisting of centralized storage and other value added distribution services including pick and pack  trucking  offering less than truckload and full truck load services utilizing both company owned trucks and a nationwide network of vans  flatbeds and drop deck trailers  expedited logistics  consisting of unique and expedited point to point service for customers with extremely time sensitive delivery requirements  rail  providing a cost effective alternative for less time sensitive delivery requirements  and non vessel operating common carrier  offering small to medium sized shippers a single source solution for ocean shipping worldwide 
horizon logistics recently opened a new warehouse and cross dock in compton  california to offer integrated inbound and export logistics services to manufacturers and retailers 
the  square foot distribution center is located miles from the los angeles long beach ports with connections to rail and road infrastructure within the alameda corridor 
horizon logistics is using the facility to offer an integrated distribution solution  including a port drayage service using company owned clean truck and transportation worker identification credential twic compliant fleet  air freight forwarding  rapid transload for international import and export logistics  intermodal transportation management  value added distribution services  and long term storage as required by customers 
market overview and competition the worldwide transportation and logistics market is an integral part of the global economy 
according to armstrong associates  an independent research firm  gross revenue for third party logistics in the united states has grown from approximately billion in to approximately billion in the global logistics industry consists of companies  large and small  that provide supply chain management  freight forwarding  distribution  warehousing and customs brokerage services 
as business requirements for efficient and cost effective logistics services have increased  so has the importance and complexity of effectively managing freight transportation 
businesses increasingly strive to minimize inventory levels  perform manufacturing and assembly operations in the lowest cost locations  and distribute their products in numerous global markets 
as a result  companies are increasingly looking to third party logistics providers to help them execute their supply chain strategies 
competition within the freight forwarding  logistics and supply chain management industry is intense  and is expected to remain so 
we compete with large international firms that have worldwide capabilities to provide all of the types of services that we offer 
we also face competition from smaller regional and local logistics providers  integrated transportation companies that operate their own aircraft  cargo sales agents and brokers  surface freight forwarders  ocean carriers  airlines  associations of shippers organized to consolidate their members shipments to obtain lower freight rates  and 
table of contents internet based freight exchanges 
in addition  computer information and consulting firms  which traditionally have operated outside of the supply chain management industry  are now expanding their scope of services to include supply chain related activities as a means of serving the logistics needs of their existing and potential customers

we also maintain workers compensation insurance  business interruption insurance  and directors and officers insurance providing indemnification for our directors  officers  and certain employees for some liabilities 
security heightened awareness of maritime security needs  brought about by the events of september  and several maritime attacks around the globe  have caused the united nations through its international maritime organization imo  the us department of homeland security  through its coast guard  and the states and local ports to adopt a more stringent set of security procedures relating to the interface between port facilities and vessels 
in addition  the us congress has enacted legislation requiring the implementation of coast guard approved vessel and facility security plans 

table of contents certain aspects of our security plans require our investing in infrastructure upgrades to ensure compliance 
we have applied in the past and will continue to apply going forward for federal grants to offset the incremental expense of these security investments 
while we were successful through two early rounds of funding to secure substantial grants for specific security projects  the current grant award criteria favor the largest ports and stakeholder consortia applications  limiting the available funds for stand alone private maritime industry stakeholders 
in addition  the current administration is continuously reviewing the criteria for awarding such grants 
such changes could have a negative impact on our ability to win grant funding in the future 
security surcharges are evaluated regularly and we may at times incorporate these surcharges into the base transportation rates that we charge 
employees as of december   we had  employees  of which approximately  were represented by seven labor unions 
in an effort to manage costs in response to declining container volumes and the deteriorating markets in puerto rico and hawaii  during the fourth quarter of the company initiated a plan to reduce its non union workforce by at least  or approximately of its non union employees 
the company substantially completed the workforce reduction initiative on january  the reduction in workforce impacted approximately non union employees resulting in an expected total restructuring charge of million related to this reduction in workforce

risk factors the company has received a subpoena from the antitrust division of the department of justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the domestic ocean shipping business  and numerous purported class action lawsuits have been filed against the company 
the government investigation and the related antitrust lawsuits could have a material effect on our business 
on april   the company received a federal grand jury subpoena and search warrant from the us district court for the middle district of florida seeking information regarding an investigation by the antitrust division of the department of justice doj into possible antitrust violations in the domestic ocean shipping business 
subsequently  the doj expanded the timeframe covered by the subpoena 
the company is currently providing documents to the doj in response to the subpoenas  and the company intends to continue to fully cooperate with the doj in its investigation 
subsequent to the commencement of the doj investigation  fifty six purported class action lawsuits were filed against the company and other domestic shipping carriers alleging price fixing in violation of the sherman act 
the complaints seek treble monetary damages  costs  attorneys fees  and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct 
the federal cases have been consolidated by the federal panel on multidistrict litigation in the district of puerto rico for the cases including the puerto rico tradelane and the western district of washington for the cases including the hawaii and guam tradelanes 
a similar complaint was filed in duval county  florida  against the company and other domestic shipping carriers by a customer alleging price fixing in violation of the florida antitrust act and the florida deceptive and unlawful trade practices act 

table of contents in addition  the company s chief executive officer and four former employees were named in two securities class action lawsuits filed in the district of delaware  alleging that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions with respect to the alleged price fixing and violations of the sherman act 
three of the former employees named in these lawsuits plead guilty to a conspiracy to eliminate competition and raise prices for moving freight between the continental us and puerto rico 
it is possible that the government investigation may lead to a criminal conviction or settlement providing for the payment of substantial fines 
it is also possible that the outcome of the investigation would damage the reputation of the company and might impair the ability of the company to conduct its ocean shipping business in one or more of the domestic trade lanes or with one or more of its customers 
further  it is possible that there could be unfavorable outcomes in the lawsuits that could result in the payment by us of substantial monetary damages 
management cannot predict or determine the timing or final outcomes of the investigation or the lawsuits and is unable to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from unfavorable outcomes but  adverse results in some or all of these legal proceedings could be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
further  the legal costs associated with the investigation and the lawsuits and the amount of time required to be spent by management and the board of directors on these matters  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to expenses incurred to defend the company in these matters  under delaware law and our bylaws  we may have an additional obligation to indemnify our current and former officers and directors in relation to those matters  and we have advanced  and may continue to advance  legal fees and expenses to certain other current and former employees 
recent deterioration in the economy and credit markets may adversely affect our future results of operations 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  it may have a material adverse effect on the company and ability to borrow money in the credit markets and potentially to draw on our revolving credit facility or otherwise 
similarly  our customers may be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to ship containers or to pay for any services they do purchase on a timely basis  if at all 
the recent changes in general economic conditions  and the impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending could result in a decrease in shipping volume in our markets which would adversely affect our results of operations 
demand for our shipping services depends on levels of shipping in our jones act markets and in the guam market  as well as on economic and trade growth and logistics 
recently  consumer confidence and consumer spending have deteriorated significantly  and could remain depressed for an extended period 
consumer purchases or discretionary items generally decline during periods where disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty  and  as a result our customers may ship fewer containers or may ship containers only at reduced rates 
for example  shipping volume in puerto rico and hawaii were both down in as compared to as a result of economic conditions 
this decrease in shipping volume could adversely impact our results of operations 

table of contents our share price will fluctuate 
stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility over the past year 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects  as well as potential further slides of our common stock due to margin calls on loans secured by pledges of our common stock 
if we do not meet the new york stock exchange continued listing requirements  our common stock may be delisted  and we may be required to repurchase or refinance our convertible notes due in order to maintain our listing on the new york stock exchange nyse  we must continue to meet the nyse minimum share price listing rule  the minimum market capitalization rule and other continued listing criteria 
if our common stock were delisted  it could i reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock  ii negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing and access the public capital markets  and iii materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if our common stock is not listed on the nyse or another national exchange  holders of our convertible notes due will be entitled to require us to repurchase their convertible notes 
our senior secured credit facility provides that the occurrence of this repurchase right constitutes a default under such facility 
we are subject to certain risks with respect to our counterparties on contracts  and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business 
we have entered into  among other things  an interest rate swap agreement and a convertible note bond hedge with various financial institutions  including wachovia bank  na  bank of america  na and goldman sachs 
such agreements subject us to counterparty risks 
the ability of each of our counterparties to performs its obligations under a contract will depend upon a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include  among other things  general economic conditions and the overall financial condition of the counterparty 
should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us  we could sustain significant losses which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further economic decline and decrease in market demand for the company s services in the jones act and guam markets will adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
a further slowdown in economic conditions of our jones act and guam markets may adversely affect our business 
demand for our shipping services depends on levels of shipping in our jones act markets and in the guam market  as well as on economic and trade growth and logistics 
cyclical or other recessions in the continental us or in these markets can negatively affect our operating results  as customers may ship fewer containers or may ship containers only at reduced rates 
for example  shipping volume in puerto rico and hawaii was down approximately in as compared to as a result of poor economic conditions 
the economic downturn in puerto rico and hawaii negatively affected our earnings 
we cannot predict the length of the current economic downturn or whether further economic decline may occur 
at this time  we are also unable to determine the impact to our customers and business  if any  of programs adopted by the us or other governments to stabilize and support the economy 

table of contents volatility in fuel prices may adversely affect our profits 
fuel is a significant operating expense for our shipping operations 
the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
as a result  variability in the price of fuel  such as we are currently experiencing  may adversely affect profitability 
there can be no assurance that our customers will agree to bear such fuel price increases via fuel surcharges without a reduction in their volumes of business with us nor any assurance that our future fuel hedging efforts  if any  will be successful 
repeal  substantial amendment  or waiver of the jones act or its application could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if the jones act were to be repealed  substantially amended  or waived and  as a consequence  competitors with lower operating costs were to enter any of our jones act markets  our business would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our advantage as a us citizen operator of jones act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the jones act 
if maritime cabotage services were included in the general agreement on trade in services  the north american free trade agreement or other international trade agreements  or if the restrictions contained in the jones act were otherwise altered  the shipping of maritime cargo between covered us ports could be opened to foreign flag or foreign built vessels 
in september  the department of homeland security issued limited temporary waivers of the jones act solely to permit the transport of petroleum and refined petroleum products in the united states in response to the damage caused to the nation s oil and gas production facilities and pipelines by hurricanes katrina and rita 
there can be no assurance as to the timing of any future waivers of the jones act or that any such waivers will be limited to the transport of petroleum and refined petroleum products 
change in tax laws or the interpretation thereof  adverse tax audits and other tax matters related to our tonnage tax election or such tax may adversely affect our future results 
during  after evaluating the merits and requirements of the tonnage tax  we elected the application of the tonnage tax instead of the federal corporate income tax on income from our qualifying shipping activities 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof  adverse tax audits  and other tax matters related to such tax election or such tax may adversely affect our future results 
during the fourth quarter of  a draft of a technical corrections act proposed redefining the puerto rico trade to not qualify for application of the tonnage tax 
the tax writing committee in congress removed the tonnage tax repeal language from the technical corrections act before its passage  but we cannot assure you that there will not be future efforts to repeal all  or any portion of  the tonnage tax as it applies to our shipping activities 
our failure to renew our commercial agreements with maersk in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have several commercial agreements with maersk  an international shipping company  that encompass terminal services  equipment sharing  cargo space charters  sales agency services  trucking services  and transportation services 
for example  under these agreements  maersk provides us with terminal services at five ports located in the continental us elizabeth  new jersey  jacksonville  florida  houston  texas  oakland  california  and tacoma  washington 
in general  these agreements  which were renewed and amended in december  are currently scheduled to expire at the end of if we fail to renew these agreements in the future  the requirements of our business will necessitate that we enter into substitute commercial agreements with third parties for at least some portion of the services contemplated under our existing commercial agreements with 
table of contents maersk  such as terminal services at our ports located in the continental us there can be no assurance that  if we fail to renew our commercial agreements with maersk  we will be successful in negotiating and entering into substitute commercial agreements with third parties and  even if we succeed in doing so  the terms and conditions of these new agreements  individually or in the aggregate  may be significantly less favorable to us than the terms and conditions of our existing agreements with maersk or others 
furthermore  if we do enter into substitute commercial agreements with third parties  changes in our operations to comply with the requirements of these new agreements such as our use of other terminals in our existing ports in the continental us or our use of other ports in the continental us may cause disruptions to our business  which could be significant  and may result in additional costs and expenses and possible losses of revenue 
our industry is unionized and strikes by our union employees or others in the industry may disrupt our services and adversely affect our operations 
as of december   we had  employees  of which  were unionized employees represented by seven different labor unions 
our industry is susceptible to work stoppages and other adverse employee actions due to the strong influence of maritime trade unions 
we may be adversely affected by future industrial action against efforts by our management or the management of other companies in our industry to reduce labor costs  restrain wage increases or modify work practices 
for example  in our operations at our us west coast ports were significantly affected by a day labor interruption by the international longshore and warehouse union 
this interruption affected ports and shippers throughout the us west coast 
in addition  in the future  we may not be able to negotiate  on terms and conditions favorable to us  renewals of our collective bargaining agreements with unions in our industry and strikes and disruptions may occur as a result of our failure or the failure of other companies in our industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully 
our collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to expire from our employees are covered by federal laws that may subject us to job related claims in addition to those provided by state laws 
some of our employees are covered by several maritime statutes  including provisions of the jones act  the death on the high seas act  the seamen s wage act and general maritime law 
these laws typically operate to make liability limits established by state workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and to permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job related injuries in federal courts 
because we are not generally protected by the limits imposed by state workers compensation statutes for these employees  we may have greater exposure for any claims made by these employees than is customary in the united states 
due to our participation in multi employer pension plans  we may have exposure under those plans that extends beyond what our obligations would be with respect to our employees 
we contribute to fifteen multi employer pension plans 
in the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by us from any plan which is underfunded  we would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan s unfunded vested benefits 
based on the limited information available from plan administrators  which we cannot independently validate  we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination would be material to our financial position and results of operations 
in the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan which is underfunded  and such employer or any member in its controlled group cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal  then we  along with the other remaining contributing employers  would be liable for our proportionate share of such plan s unfunded vested benefits 
we 
table of contents have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to any withdrawal liability and cannot assure you that no other contributing employer will take such action 
in addition  if a multi employer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements  the internal revenue service  pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  referred to herein as the code  will impose an excise tax of five percent on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency 
under section c of the code  the liability of each contributing employer  including us  will be determined in part by each employer s respective delinquency in meeting the required employer contributions under the plan 
the code also requires contributing employers to make additional contributions in order to reduce the deficiency to zero  which may  along with the payment of the excise tax  have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
compliance with safety and environmental protection and other governmental requirements may adversely affect our operations 
the shipping industry in general and our business and the operation of our vessels and terminals in particular are affected by extensive and changing safety  environmental protection and other international  national  state and local governmental laws and regulations 
for example  our vessels  as us flagged vessels  generally must be maintained in class and are subject to periodic inspections by the american bureau of shipping or similar classification societies  and must be periodically inspected by  or on behalf of  the us coast guard 
in addition  the united states oil pollution act of referred to as opa  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation liability act of referred to as cercla  and certain state laws require us  as a vessel operator  to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil or hazardous substance spill prevention  response and clean up 
in complying with these laws  we have incurred expenses and may incur future expenses for ship modifications and changes in operating procedures 
changes in enforcement policies for existing requirements and additional laws and regulations adopted in the future could limit our ability to do business or further increase the cost of our doing business 
we believe our vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements  are operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable safety environmental laws and regulations and are insured against the usual risks for such amounts as our management deems appropriate 
our vessels operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels 
however  there can be no assurance that such certificates and licenses will be renewed 
also  in the future  we may have to alter existing equipment  add new equipment to  or change operating procedures for  our vessels to comply with changes in governmental regulations  safety or other equipment standards to meet our customers changing needs 
if any such costs are material  they could adversely affect our financial condition 
we are subject to statutory and regulatory directives in the united states addressing homeland security concerns that may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations 
various government agencies within the department of homeland security dhs  including the transportation security administration  the us coast guard  and us bureau of customs and border protection  have adopted  and may adopt in the future  rules  policies or regulations or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  rules  policies or regulations  compliance with which could increase our costs or result in loss of revenue 
the coast guard s maritime security regulations  issued pursuant to the maritime transportation security act of mtsa  require us to operate our vessels and facilities pursuant to both the maritime security regulations and approved security plans 
our vessels and facilities are subject to periodic security compliance verification examinations by the coast guard 
a failure to operate in accordance with the maritime security regulations or the approved security plans may result in the 
table of contents imposition of a fine or control and compliance measures  including the suspension or revocation of the security plan  thereby making the vessel or facility ineligible to operate 
we are also required to audit these security plans on an annual basis and  if necessary  submit amendments to the coast guard for its review and approval 
failure to timely submit the necessary amendments may lead to the imposition of the fines and control and compliance measures mentioned above 
failure to meet the requirements of the maritime security regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
dhs may adopt additional security related regulations  including new requirements for screening of cargo and our reimbursement to the agency for the cost of security services 
these new security related regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to efficiently process cargo or could increase our costs 
in particular  our customers typically need quick shipping of their cargos and rely on our on time shipping capabilities 
if these regulations disrupt or impede the timing of our shipments  we may fail to meet the needs of our customers  or may increase expenses to do so 
increased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business 
domestic and international container shipping is subject to various security and customs inspection and related procedures  referred to herein as inspection procedures  in countries of origin and destination as well as in countries in which transshipment points are located 
inspection procedures can result in the seizure of containers or their contents  delays in the loading  offloading  transshipment or delivery of containers and the levying of customs duties  fines or other penalties against exporters or importers and  in some cases  shipping and logistics companies such as us 
failure to comply with these procedures may result in the imposition of fines and or the taking of control or compliance measures by the applicable governmental agency  including the denial of entry into us waters 
we understand that  currently  only a small proportion of all containers delivered to the united states are physically inspected by us  state or local authorities prior to delivery to their destinations 
the us government  foreign governments  international organizations  and industry associations have been considering ways to improve and expand inspection procedures 
there are numerous proposals to enhance the existing inspection procedures  which if implemented would likely affect shipping and logistics companies such as us 
such changes could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us  including additional responsibility for physically inspecting and recording the contents of containers we are shipping 
in addition  changes to inspection procedures could impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may  in certain cases  render the shipment of certain types of cargo by container uneconomical or impractical 
any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
restrictions on foreign ownership of our vessels could limit our ability to sell off any portion of our business or result in the forfeiture of our vessels 
the jones act restricts the foreign ownership interests in the entities that directly or indirectly own the vessels which we operate in our jones act markets 
if we were to seek to sell any portion of our business that owns any of these vessels  we would have fewer potential purchasers  since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the foreign ownership restrictions described above 
as a result  the sales price for that portion of our business may not attain the amount that could be obtained in an unregulated market 
furthermore  at any point horizon lines  llc  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary and principal operating subsidiary  ceases to be controlled and owned by us citizens  we would become ineligible to operate in our current jones act markets and may become subject to penalties and risk forfeiture of our vessels 

table of contents no assurance can be given that our insurance costs will not escalate 
our protection and indemnity insurance p i is provided by a mutual p i club which is a member of the international group of p i clubs 
as a mutual club  it relies on member premiums  investment reserves and income  and reinsurance to manage liability risks on behalf of its members 
increased investment losses  underwriting losses  or reinsurance costs could cause international marine insurance clubs to increase the cost of premiums  resulting not only in higher premium costs but also higher levels of deductibles and self insurance retentions 
our coverage under the longshore act for us longshore and harbor workers compensation is provided by signal mutual indemnity association ltd 
signal mutual is a non profit organization whose members pool risks of a similar nature to achieve long term and stable insurance protection at cost 
signal mutual is now the largest provider of longshore benefits in the country 
this program provides for first dollar coverage without a deductible 
catastrophic losses and other liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and such losses and liability may be beyond insurance coverage 
the operation of any oceangoing vessel carries with it an inherent risk of catastrophic maritime disaster  mechanical failure  collision  and loss of or damage to cargo 
also  in the course of the operation of our vessels  marine disasters  such as oil spills and other environmental mishaps  cargo loss or damage  and business interruption due to political or other developments  as well as maritime disasters not involving us  labor disputes  strikes and adverse weather conditions  could result in loss of revenue  liabilities or increased costs  personal injury  loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
damage arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits asserting large claims 
although we maintain insurance  including retentions and deductibles  at levels that we believe are consistent with industry norms against the risks described above  including loss of life  there can be no assurance that this insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages suffered by us from the occurrence of all of the risks described above or the loss of income resulting from one or more of our vessels being removed from operation 
we also cannot assure you that a claim will be paid or that we will be able to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates in the future 
further  if we are negligent or otherwise responsible in connection with any such event  our insurance may not cover our claim 
in the event that any of the claims arising from any of the foregoing possible events were assessed against us  all of our assets could be subject to attachment and other judicial process 
as a result of the significant insurance losses incurred in the september  attack and related concern regarding terrorist attacks  global insurance markets increased premiums and reduced or restricted coverage for terrorist losses generally 
accordingly  premiums payable for terrorist coverage have increased substantially and the level of terrorist coverage has been significantly reduced 
additionally  new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution  and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable 
the reliability of our service may be adversely affected if our spare vessels reserved for relief are not deployed efficiently under extreme circumstances  which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results 
we generally keep spare vessels in reserve available for relief if one of our vessels in active service suffers a maritime disaster or must be unexpectedly removed from service for repairs 
however  these spare vessels may require several days of sailing before it can replace the other vessel  resulting in service disruptions and loss of revenue 
if more than one of our vessels in active service suffers a maritime disaster or must be unexpectedly removed from service  we may have to redeploy vessels from our other trade routes  or lease one or more vessels from third parties 

table of contents we may suffer a material adverse effect on our business if we are unable to rapidly deploy one of our spare vessels and we fail to provide on time scheduled service and adequate capacity to our customers 
interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impair our ability to effectively provide our shipping and logistics services  especially hits  which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results 
our provision of our shipping and logistics services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems  especially hits 
we have experienced brief system failures in the past and may experience brief or substantial failures in the future 
any failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service reducing our revenue and profits and damaging our brand 
some of our systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning does not account for all eventualities 
the occurrence of a natural disaster  or other unanticipated problems at our facilities at which we maintain and operate our systems could result in lengthy interruptions or delays in our shipping and logistics services  especially hits 
our vessels could be arrested by maritime claimants  which could result in significant loss of earnings and cash flow 
crew members  suppliers of goods and services to a vessel  shippers of cargo  lenders and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts  claims or damages 
in many jurisdictions  a claimant may enforce its lien by either arresting or attaching a vessel through foreclosure proceedings 
moreover  crew members may place liens for unpaid wages that can include significant statutory penalty wages if the unpaid wages remain overdue eg  double wages for every day during which the unpaid wages remain overdue 
the arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could result in a significant loss of earnings and cash flow for the period during which the arrest or attachment is continuing 
in addition  international vessel arrest conventions and certain national jurisdictions allow so called sister ship arrests  which allow the arrest of vessels that are within the same legal ownership as the vessel which is subject to the claim or lien 
certain jurisdictions go further  permitting not only the arrest of vessels within the same legal ownership  but also any associated vessel 
in nations with these laws  an association may be recognized when two vessels are owned by companies controlled by the same party 
consequently  a claim may be asserted against us or any of our vessels for the liability of one or more of the other vessels that we own 
we are susceptible to severe weather and natural disasters 
our operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea  hurricanes  typhoons and earthquakes 
such events will interfere with our ability to provide the on time scheduled service our customers demand resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events 
in addition  severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with our terminal operations  and may cause serious damage to our vessels  loss or damage to containers  cargo and other equipment and loss of life or physical injury to our employees 
terminals in the south pacific ocean  particularly in guam  and terminals on the east coast of the continental us and in the caribbean are particularly susceptible to hurricanes and typhoons 
in the recent past  the terminal at our port in guam was seriously damaged by a typhoon and our terminal in puerto rico was seriously damaged by a hurricane 
these storms resulted in damage to cranes and other equipment and closure of these facilities 
earthquakes in anchorage and in guam have also damaged our terminal facilities resulting in delay in terminal operations and increased expenses 
any such damage will not be fully covered by insurance 

table of contents we may face new competitors 
other established or start up shipping operators may enter our markets to compete with us for business 
existing non jones act qualified shipping operators whose container ships sail between ports in asia and the us west coast could add hawaii  guam or alaska as additional stops on their sailing routes for non us originated or destined cargo 
shipping operators could also add puerto rico as a new stop on sailings of their vessels between the continental us and ports in europe  the caribbean  and latin america for non us originated or destined cargo 
further  shipping operators could introduce us flagged vessels into service sailing between guam and us ports  including ports on the us west coast or in hawaii 
on these routes to and from guam no limits would apply as to the origin or destination of the cargo dropped off or picked up 
in addition  current or new us citizen shipping operators may order the building of new vessels by us shipyards and may introduce these us built vessels into jones act qualified service on one or more of our trade routes 
these potential competitors may have access to financial resources substantially greater than our own 
the entry of a new competitor on any of our trade routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not exercise our purchase options for our chartered vessels 
we intend to exercise our purchase options for up to three of the jones act vessels that we have chartered upon the expiration of their charters in january in addition  we have not determined whether we will exercise our scheduled purchase options for the five newly built us flag vessels that we have chartered 
there can be no assurance that  when these options for these eight vessels become exercisable  the price at which these vessels may be purchased will be reasonable in light of the fair market value of these vessels at such time or that we will have the funds required to make these purchases 
as a result  we may not exercise our options to purchase these vessels 
if we do not exercise our options  we may need to renew our existing charters for these vessels or charter replacement vessels 
there can be no assurance that our existing charters will be renewed  or  if renewed  that they will be renewed at favorable rates  or  if not renewed  that we will be able to charter replacement vessels at favorable rates 
we may face significant costs as the vessels currently in our fleet age 
we believe that each of the vessels we currently operate has an estimated useful life of approximately years from the year it was built 
as of the date hereof  the average age of our active vessels is approximately years and the average age of our jones act vessels is approximately years 
we expect to incur increasing costs to operate and maintain the vessels in good condition as they age 
eventually  these vessels will need to be replaced 
we may not be able to replace all of our existing vessels with new vessels based on uncertainties related to financing  timing and shipyard availability 
we may face unexpected substantial dry docking costs for our vessels 
our vessels are dry docked periodically to comply with regulatory requirements and to affect maintenance and repairs  if necessary 
the cost of such repairs at each dry docking are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial 
our established processes have enabled us to make on average six dry dockings per year over the last five years with a minimal impact on schedule 
in addition  our vessels may have to be dry docked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage 
our insurance may not cover all of these costs 
large unpredictable repair and dry docking expenses could significantly decrease our profits 

table of contents loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future success will depend  in significant part  upon the continued services of charles g 
raymond  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  michael t 
avara  our chief financial officer  john v 
keenan  our president  horizon lines  llc  and brian w 
taylor  our president  horizon logistics  llc 
the loss of the services of any of these executive officers could adversely affect our future operating results because of their experience and knowledge of our business and customer relationships 
if key employees depart  we may have to incur significant costs to replace them and our ability to execute our business model could be impaired if we cannot replace them in a timely manner 
we do not expect to maintain key person insurance on any of our executive officers 
additionally  unanticipated disruptions to our business may occur due to the company s recent reduction in workforce initiative 
we are subject to  and may in the future be subject to  disputes  or legal or other proceedings  that could have a material adverse effect on us 
the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for disputes  or legal or other proceedings  from time to time relating to labor and employment matters  personal injury and property damage  environmental matters and other matters  as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this prospectus 
in addition  as a common carrier  our tariffs  rates  rules and practices in dealing with our customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign  federal  state and local regulations which are the subject of disputes or administrative and or judicial proceedings from time to time 
these disputes  individually or collectively  could harm our business by distracting our management from the operation of our business 
if these disputes develop into proceedings  these proceedings  individually or collectively  could involve significant expenditures by us or result in significant changes to our tariffs  rates  rules and practices in dealing with our customers that could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and profitability 
our cash flows and capital resources may be insufficient to make required payments on our substantial indebtedness and future indebtedness 
as of december   on a consolidated basis  we had i approximately million of outstanding long term debt exclusive of outstanding letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of million  ii approximately million of aggregate trade payables  accrued liabilities and other balance sheet liabilities other than the long term debt referred to above and iii a debt to equity ratio of approximately because we have substantial debt  we require significant amounts of cash to fund our debt service obligations 
our ability to generate cash to meet scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to our debt depends on our financial and operating performance which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to the following financial and business factors  some of which may be beyond our control operating difficulties  increased operating costs  increased fuel costs  general economic conditions  decreased demand for our services  market cyclicality  tariff rates  prices for our services  the actions of competitors  regulatory developments  and delays in implementing strategic projects 

table of contents if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  dispose of material assets or operations  seek to obtain additional equity capital  or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
in particular  in the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service obligations  we cannot be sure as to the timing of such dispositions or the proceeds that we would realize from those dispositions 
the value realized from such dispositions will depend on market conditions and the availability of buyers  and  consequently  any such disposition may not  among other things  result in sufficient cash proceeds to repay our indebtedness 
also  the senior credit facility contains covenants that may limit our ability to dispose of material assets or operations or to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
further  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing  given the uncertainty of prevailing market conditions from time to time  our high levels of indebtedness and the various debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the senior credit facility 
if we are able to restructure or refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing  the economic terms on which such indebtedness is restructured  refinanced or obtained may not be favorable to us 
we may incur substantial indebtedness in the future 
the terms of the senior credit facility permit us to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness under certain circumstances 
as of december   we had approximately million of additional borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility  subject to compliance with the financial and other covenants and the other terms set forth therein 
in addition  our senior credit facility allows for additional term loan borrowing availability of up to million if certain covenants are met 
our incurrence of additional indebtedness would intensify the risk that our future cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our substantial indebtedness 
financial and other covenants under our current and future indebtedness could significantly impair our ability to operate our business 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  including guarantees  prepay other indebtedness or amend other debt instruments  pay dividends or make investments  loans or advances  create liens on assets  enter into sale and lease back transactions  engage in mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  change the business conducted by them  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
in addition  under the senior credit facility  we are required to comply with financial covenants  comprised of leverage and interest coverage ratio requirements 
our ability to comply with these covenants will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance  which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial  market and competitive factors  many of which are beyond our control  and will be substantially dependent on our financial and operating performance which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to various financial and business factors  including those discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this form k  some of which may be beyond our control 

table of contents under our senior credit facility we are required  subject to certain exceptions  to make mandatory prepayments of amounts under the senior credit facility with all or a portion of the net proceeds of certain asset sales and events of loss  certain debt issuances  certain equity issuances and a portion of their excess cash flow 
our circumstances at the time of any such prepayment  particularly our liquidity and ability to access funds  cannot be anticipated at this time 
any such prepayment could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on us 
mandatory prepayments are first applied to the outstanding term loans and  after all of the term loans are paid in full  then applied to reduce the loans under the revolving credit facility with corresponding reductions in revolving credit facility commitments 
our substantial indebtedness and future indebtedness could significantly impair our operating and financial condition 
the required payments on our substantial indebtedness and future indebtedness  as well as the restrictive covenants contained in the senior credit facility could significantly impair our operating and financial condition 
for example  these required payments and restrictive covenants could make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations  make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  expose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate on the debt under our revolving credit facility is variable  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt 
we may incur substantial indebtedness in the future 
our incurrence of additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above 
our secured credit facility exposes us to the variability of interest rates 
the revolving credit and term loan portions of our senior credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
as of december   we had outstanding a million term loan and million under the revolving credit facility  which bear interest at variable rates 
the interest rates applicable to the senior credit facility vary with the prevailing corporate base rate offered by the administrative agent under the senior credit facility or with libor 
if these rates were to increase significantly  our ability to borrow additional funds may be reduced and the risks related to our substantial indebtedness would intensify 
each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a million change in annual interest expense on each of the term loan and the revolving credit facility 
accordingly  a significant rise in interest rates would adversely affect our financial results 
if non us citizens own more than of our stock  we may not have the funds or the ability to redeem any excess shares and we could be forced to suspend our jones act operations 
our certificate of incorporation contains provisions voiding transfers of shares of any class or series of our capital stock that would result in non us citizens  in the aggregate  owning in excess of of the shares of such class or series 
in the event that this transfer restriction would be 
table of contents ineffective  our certificate of incorporation provides for the automatic transfer of such excess shares to a trust specified therein 
these trust provisions also apply to excess shares that would result from a change in the status of a record or beneficial owner of shares of our capital stock from a us citizen to a us citizen 
in the event that these trust transfer provisions would also be ineffective  our certificate of incorporation permits us to redeem such excess shares 
however  we may not be able to redeem such excess shares because our operations may not have generated sufficient excess cash flow to fund such a redemption 
if such a situation occurs  there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary to effect such a redemption on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
the senior credit facility permits upstream payments from our subsidiaries  subject to exceptions  to the company to fund redemptions of excess shares 
if  for any of the foregoing reasons or otherwise  we are unable to effect such a redemption when such ownership of shares by non us citizens is in excess of of such class or series  or otherwise prevent non us citizens in the aggregate from owning shares in excess of of any such class or series  or fail to exercise our redemption right because we are unaware that such ownership exceeds such percentage  we will likely be unable to comply with applicable maritime laws 
if all of the citizenship related safeguards in our certificate of incorporation fail at a time when ownership of shares of any class or series of our stock is in excess of of such class or series  we will likely be required to suspend our jones act operations 
any such actions by governmental authorities would have a severely detrimental impact on our results of operations 
we may not have the necessary funds to pay dividends on our common stock or we may elect not to pay dividends on our common stock 
we require continuing  significant cash flow in order for us to make payments of regular dividends to our stockholders 
however  we have no operations of our own and have derived  and will continue to derive  all of our revenues and cash flow from our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to make funds available to us 
they may not have sufficient funds or assets to permit payments to us in amounts sufficient to fund future dividend payments 
also  our subsidiaries are subject to contractual restrictions including with their secured and unsecured creditors that may limit their ability to upstream cash indirectly or directly to us 
thus  there is a significant risk that we may not have the requisite funds to make regular dividend payments in the future 
in addition  we may elect not to pay dividends as a substantial portion of our future earnings will be utilized to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to fund the development and growth of our business 
environmental and other regulation all of our operations are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations implemented principally by the environmental protection agency the epa  the united states department of transportation  the united states coast guard and state environmental regulatory agencies 
these regulations govern the management of hazardous wastes  discharge of pollutants into the air  surface and underground waters  including rivers  harbors and the mile exclusive economic zone of the united states  and the disposal of certain substances 
the operation of our vessels is also subject to regulation under various international and federal laws  as interpreted and implemented by the united states coast guard the coast guard  as well as certain state and local laws 
additionally  our vessels are required to meet construction and repair standards established by the american bureau of shipping abs  det norske veritas dnv and or the coast guard  and to meet operational  security and safety standards presently established by the coast guard 
the coast guard further licenses our seagoing supervisory personnel and certifies our seamen 
our marine operations are further subject to regulation by various federal agencies or the successors to those agencies  including the surface transportation board the successor federal 
table of contents agency to the interstate commerce commission  the united states department of transportation maritime administration marad  the federal maritime commission and the coast guard 
these regulatory authorities have broad powers over operational safety  tariff filings of freight rates  service contracts  certain mergers  contraband  environmental contamination  financial reporting and homeland  port and vessel security 
our common and contract motor carrier operations are regulated by the united states surface transportation board and various state agencies 
the company s drivers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the united states department of transportation  including certain regulations for drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
the officers and unlicensed crew members employed aboard our vessels must also comply with numerous safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the coast guard  including certain regulations for drug testing and hours of service 
the united states oil pollution act of and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act in  the oil pollution act of opa was enacted to establish an extensive regulatory and liability regime designed to protect the environment from the damage caused by oil spills 
opa is applicable to all owners and operators whose vessels trade with the united states or its territories or possessions  or whose vessels operate in the navigable waters of the united states  which include the united states territorial sea and the nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the united states 
additionally  under opa  vessel owners  operators and bareboat charterers are responsible parties and are jointly  severally and strictly liable unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party  an act of god or an act of war for all containment and clean up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels 
damages are defined broadly under opa to include natural resources damages and the costs of assessment thereof  damages for injury to  or economic losses resulting from the destruction of  real and personal property  the net loss of taxes  royalties  rents  fees and profits by the united states government  and any state or political subdivision thereof  lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage  the net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response  such as protection from fire  safety or other hazards  and the loss of subsistence use of natural resources 
effective july   opa was amended to increase the liability limits for responsible parties for any vessel other than a tank vessel to per gross ton or  whichever is greater 
these limits of liability do not apply if an incident was directly caused by violation of applicable federal safety  construction or operating regulations or by a responsible party s gross negligence or willful misconduct  or if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to cooperate and assist in connection with oil removal activities 
in  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla was adopted and is applicable to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil whether on land or at sea 
cercla also imposes liability similarly to opa and provides for cleanup  removal and natural resource damage 
liability per vessel under cercla is limited to the greater of per gross ton or million  unless the incident is caused by gross negligence  willful misconduct  or a violation of certain regulations  in which case liability is unlimited 

table of contents opa requires owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the coast guard evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet their potential liabilities under the opa 
effective october   the coast guard regulations requiring evidence of financial responsibility were amended to conform the opa financial responsibility requirements to the july increases in liability limits 
current coast guard regulations require evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of per gross ton for non tank vessels  which includes the opa limitation on liability of per gross ton and the cercla liability limit of per gross ton 
it is expected that the coast guard will increase the amounts of financial responsibility to reflect the july increases in liability 
under the regulations  vessel owners and operators may evidence their financial responsibility by showing proof of insurance  surety bond  self insurance or guaranty 
under opa  an owner or operator of a fleet of vessels is required only to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility in an amount sufficient to cover the vessels in the fleet having the greatest maximum liability under opa 
the coast guard s regulations concerning certificates of financial responsibility provide  in accordance with opa  that claimants may bring suit directly against an insurer or guarantor that furnishes certificates of financial responsibility 
in the event that such insurer or guarantor is sued directly  it is prohibited from asserting any contractual defense that it may have had against the responsible party and is limited to asserting those defenses available to the responsible party and the defense that the incident was caused by the willful misconduct of the responsible party 
certain organizations  which had typically provided certificates of financial responsibility under pre opa laws  including the major protection and indemnity organizations  have declined to furnish evidence of insurance for vessel owners and operators if they are subject to direct actions or are required to waive insurance policy defenses 
opa specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries  and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills 
in some cases  states  which have enacted such legislation  have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessels owners responsibilities under these laws 
we intend to comply with all applicable state regulations in the ports where our vessels call 
we maintain certificates of financial responsibility as required by the coast guard for our vessels 
the united states clean water act in  the united states clean water act cwa prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances in navigable waters and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges 
the cwa also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal  remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under opa and cercla 
the epa historically exempted the discharge of ballast water and other substances incidental to the normal operation of vessels in the united states ports from the cwa permitting requirements 
on march   however  a united states district court ruled that the epa exceeded its authority in creating an exemption for ballast water 
on september   the court issued an order invalidating the exemption in the epa s regulations for all discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel as of september   and directing the epa to develop a system for regulating all discharges from vessels by that date 
under the court s ruling  owners and operators of vessels visiting united states ports also would be required to comply with the cwa permitting program to be developed by the epa or face penalties 
the district court s decision was affirmed by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit on july  on august   the district court ordered that the date for implementation of the proposed vessel general permit for discharges incidental to normal operation be postponed until february  the epa has issued regulations implementing a vessel general permit vgp that codifies best management practices for the control of twenty eight listed  specific discharges  including ballast water  that occur normally in the operation of a vessel 
we expect the vgp requirements set forth by 
table of contents epa will increase our record keeping requirements but we do not otherwise expect a material impact on our operations 
several states have specified significant  additional requirements in connection with such state mandated cwa certifications relating to the vgp rules and regulations 
the discharge sampling mandate in california and the greywater discharge prohibition in new jersey  are currently being challenged legally 
we cannot predict the outcome of such legal challenges or the response of the states to such legal challenges  and  therefore  the effect of the pending vgp rulemaking on our operations cannot be predicted 
as a result of these court decisions  however  our vessels ultimately will be subject to cwa permit requirements that could include ballast water treatment obligations that could increase the cost of operating in the united states 
various states have also enacted legislation restricting ballast water discharges and the introduction of non indigenous species considered to be invasive 
these and any similar restrictions enacted in the future could increase the costs of operating in the relevant waters 
the national invasive species act the united states national invasive species act nisa was enacted in in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into united states waters through ballast water taken on by vessels in foreign ports 
the coast guard adopted regulations under nisa in july that impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering united states waters 
these requirements can be met by performing mid ocean ballast exchange  by retaining ballast water on board the vessel  or by using environmentally sound alternative ballast water management methods approved by the coast guard 
mid ocean ballast exchange is the primary method for compliance with the coast guard regulations  since holding ballast water can prevent vessels from performing cargo operations upon arrival in the united states  and alternative methods are still under development 
vessels that are unable to conduct mid ocean ballast exchange due to voyage or safety concerns may discharge minimum amounts of ballast water  provided that they comply with recordkeeping requirements and document the reasons they could not follow the required ballast water management requirements 
the coast guard is developing a proposal to establish ballast water discharge standards  which could set maximum acceptable discharge limits for various invasive species  and or lead to requirements for active treatment of ballast water 
the united states house of representatives recently passed a bill that amends nisa by prohibiting the discharge of ballast water unless it has been treated with specified methods or acceptable alternatives 
similar bills have been introduced in the united states senate  but it cannot be predicted which bill  if any  will be enacted into law 
in the absence of federal standards  states have enacted legislation or regulations to address invasive species through ballast water and hull cleaning management and permitting requirements 
for instance  the state of california has recently enacted legislation extending its ballast water management program to regulate the management of hull fouling organisms attached to vessels and adopted regulations limiting the number of organisms in ballast water discharges 
additionally  a united states district court dismissed challenges to the state of michigan s ballast water management legislation mandating the use of various techniques for ballast water treatment  this decision was affirmed by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit on november  other states may proceed with the enactment of similar requirements that could increase the costs of operating in state waters 
the united states clean air act in  the united states clean air act as amended by the clean air act amendments of and  the caa was enacted and required the epa to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants 
the caa also requires states to draft state implementation plans sips  which are designed to attain national health based air quality standards in primarily major metropolitan and or industrial areas 
several sips regulate 
table of contents emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment 
the epa and some states  however  have each proposed more stringent regulations of air emissions from ocean going vessels 
for example  the california air resources board of the state of california the carb has petitioned the epa to permit california clean fuel regulations applicable to all vessels sailing within miles of the california coastline whose itineraries call for them to enter any california ports  terminal facilities  or internal or estuarine waters 
if california regulation is permitted by the epa  we may be required to use low sulfur fuels  which are more costly  in our auxillary diesel engines on ships entering california ports 
the state of california is also implementing regulations that will require vessels to either shut down the auxiliary engines while in port in california and use electrical power supplied at the dock or implement alternatives means to significantly reduce emissions from the vessel s electric power generating equipment while it is in port 
generally  a vessel will run its auxiliary engines while at port in order to power lighting  ventilation  pumps  communication and other onboard equipment 
the emissions from running auxiliary engines while at port may be contributors to particulate matter in the ambient air 
the purpose of the regulations is to reduce the emissions from a vessel while it is in port 
the cost of reducing vessel emissions while at port may be substantial if we determine that we can not use or the ports will not permit us to use electrical power supplied at the dock 
alternatively  the ports may pass the cost of supplying electrical power at the port to us  and we may incur additional costs in connection with modifying our vessels to use electrical power supplied at the dock 
international law  the marpol international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships   as modified by the protocol of relating thereto convention  may  in the future  require the use of low sulfur fuels world wide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on ships 
by july   the marpol amendments are expected to require all diesel engines on ships built between and to meet a nitrous oxide nox standard of g nox kw hr 
on january  the nox standard will be lowered to g nox kw hr and on january  it will be further lowered to g nox kw hr  for vessels operating in a designated emission control area eca 
in addition  the current global sulfur cap of sulfur will be reduced to sulfur in and further reduced to as low as sulfur as early as  and no later than  depending upon recommendations made in connection with a marpol fuel availability study scheduled for under these marpol amendments  the current maximum sulfur omission permitted in designated sulfur emission control areas secas will be reduced to sulfur on july   and then further reduced to sulfur on january  these sulfur limitations will be applied to all subsequently approved secas under the marpol amendments 
we expect that the epa will submit a petition to the international maritime organization  in coordination with environment canada  to designate all coastal areas of the u 
s and canada as seca s as early as the spring of the resource conservation and recovery act our operations occasionally generate and require the transportation  treatment and disposal of both hazardous and non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the united states resource conservation and recovery act or comparable state  local or foreign requirements 
in addition  from time to time we arrange for the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances at offsite disposal facilities 
if such materials are improperly disposed of by third parties  we may still be held liable for clean up costs under applicable laws 
endangered species regulation the endangered species act  federal conservation regulations and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction 
protection of endangered species may include restrictions on the speed of vessels in certain ocean waters and may require us to change the routes of our vessels during particular periods 
for example  in an effort to prevent the collision of vessels with the 
table of contents north atlantic right whale  federal regulations restrict the speed of vessels to ten knots or less in certain areas along the atlantic coast of the us the reduced speed of our vessels and special routing along the atlantic coast of our vessels is expected to result in the use of additional fuel  which will affect our results of operations 
greenhouse gas regulation in february  the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change the kyoto protocol was enacted 
pursuant to the kyoto protocol  adopting countries are required to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases  generally referred to as greenhouse gases  which are suspected of contributing to global warming 
in october  the california attorney general and a coalition of environmental groups petitioned the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from ocean going vessels under the caa 
any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives in the united states that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could entail financial impacts on our operations that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
vessel security regulations since september   there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security within the united states 
on november   the maritime transportation security act of the mtsa came into effect 
to implement certain portions of the mtsa  in july  the coast guard issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states 
similarly  in december  amendments to the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security 
the new chapter came into effect in july and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities  most of which are contained in the newly created international ship and port facilities security code the isps code 
among the various requirements are on board installation of automatic information systems to enhance vessel to vessel and vessel to shore communications  on board installation of ship security alert systems  the development of vessel and facility security plans  the implementation of a transportation workers identification credential program  and compliance with flag state security certification requirements 
the coast guard regulations  intended to align with international maritime security standards  exempt non united states vessels from mtsa vessel security measures provided such vessels have on board a valid international ship security certificate that attests to the vessel s compliance with solas security requirements and the isps code as ratified by the ship s flag state 
vessels native to the united states  however  are not exempted from the security measures addressed by the mtsa  solas and the isps code 
we have implemented the various security measures addressed by the mtsa  solas and the isps code 
we are committed to protecting the environment 
we support our commitment with programs that promote best practices in environmental stewardship 
during  we launched our horizon green initiative 
through our horizon green initiative  we strive to better understand and measure our impact 
table of contents on the environment  and to develop programs that incorporate environmental stewardship and impact into our core operations 
within the horizon green initiative  we are addressing four key areas marine environment to protect the marine environment  we have established several programs in addition to compliance with the marpol convention international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships and ism code international safety management code created by the international maritime organization 
these programs include vessel management controls and audits  ballast water management  waste stream analyses  low sulfur diesel fuel usage and marine terminal pollution mitigation plans 
emissions we are focused on reducing transportation emissions  including carbon dioxide  particulates  nitrous oxides and sulfur dioxide  through improvements in vessel fuel consumption and truck efficiency combined with the use of alternative fuels and more efficient transportation alternatives  such as coastwise shipping 
sustainability we believe in a long term  sustainable approach to logistics management which will benefit the company  its associates  customers  shareholders and the community 
examples include reducing empty backhaul miles through logistics network optimization  reduced fossil fuel consumption and using recycled materials to build containers 
carbon offsets freight shipping is one of the world s leading sources of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global climate change 
to address this challenge together with our customers  horizon logistics has introduced a new carbon offset shipping program  developed by our custom delivery and special handling division 
the carbon offset program offers customers a carbon neutral shipping solution through which retailers and manufacturers can purchase environmental credits that fund carbon offset programs  such as forestation and alternative energy projects

table of contents during  the company elected the application of a tonnage tax instead of the federal corporate income tax on income from its qualifying shipping activities 
this election of the tonnage tax was made in connection with the filing of the company s federal corporate income tax return and will also apply to all subsequent federal income tax returns unless the company revokes this alternative tonnage tax treatment 
the company does not intend to revoke its election of the tonnage tax in the foreseeable future 
the company accounted for this election as a change in the tax status of its qualifying shipping activities 
the impact of this tonnage tax election resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of approximately million during the year ended december  approximately million  or per share  and million  or per share  relate to the reduction in income tax expense and revaluation of the deferred taxes related to the application of tonnage tax to qualifying activities  respectively

ebitda is defined as net income plus net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe that in addition to gaap based financial information  ebitda is a meaningful disclosure for the following reasons i ebitda is a component of the measure used by our board of directors and management team to evaluate our operating performance  ii the senior credit facility contains covenants that requires the company to maintain certain interest expense coverage and leverage ratios  which contain ebitda as a component  and restrict certain cash payments if certain ratios are not met  subject to certain exclusions  and our management team uses ebitda to monitor compliance with such covenants  iii ebitda is a component of the measure used by our management team to make day to day operating decisions  iv ebitda is a component of the measure used by our management to facilitate internal comparisons to competitors results and the marine container shipping and logistics industry in general and v the payment of discretionary bonuses to certain members of our management is contingent upon  among other things  the satisfaction by horizon lines of certain targets  which contain ebitda as a

we acknowledge that there are limitations when using ebitda 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments and debt service requirements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated and combined financial data and our annual audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding forward looking statements  see the safe harbor statement on page i of this form k 
executive overview the ongoing weakness in the economy and deteriorating credit markets continue to impact consumer confidence and spending  and ultimately  our financial performance 
volatility in prices for petroleum products had a negative impact on our results from operations during although we deliver basic food  clothing and shelter to customers and consumers  many markets  including our own  are experiencing an increased number of business closures  sharp declines in housing starts and tourism  and a general slowdown in consumer spending 
container volumes during the year ended december  were impacted by deteriorating market conditions in puerto rico and hawaii 
in addition  lower volumes and a reduction in seafood quotas affected terminal services revenue 
operating revenue grew as a result of higher fuel surcharges to help offset increases in fuel costs  unit revenue improvements resulting from general rate increases and cargo mix changes  improved space charter revenue  and revenue related to acquisitions 
operating expenses during the year ended december  were impacted by an increase in the cost of fuel  higher vessel operating costs due to the deployment of five new vessels during  and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses due to the department of justice antitrust investigation and related legal proceedings and higher compensation costs 
in addition  operating expenses include restructuring and impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
in an effort to manage costs in response to declining container volumes and the deteriorating markets in puerto rico and hawaii  during the fourth quarter of we initiated a plan to reduce our non union workforce by at least  or approximately of its non union employees 
we substantially completed the workforce reduction initiative on january  the reduction in workforce impacted approximately non union employees resulting in an expected total restructuring charge of million related to this reduction in workforce 
of the million  a charge of million  or per fully diluted share  was recorded during the fourth quarter of and the remaining million will be recorded during the first quarter of of the million recorded during the fourth quarter of  million was included within the horizon lines segment and the remaining million was included in the horizon logistics segment 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we determined that  as a result of the recent deterioration in the economy  credit markets and other market conditions discussed above  we evaluated our intangible assets subject to amortization and certain of our owned and leased assets for impairment during the fourth quarter additionally  we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill 
our impairment evaluations were constructed using a variety of methodologies in determining fair value  including cash flow analyses that are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
based on our evaluations  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
the impairment charge within our horizon lines operating segment totaling million related to our spare vessels and certain owned and leased equipment of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge totaling 
table of contents million within our horizon logistics operating segment related to goodwill and customer contracts of million and million  respectively 
year year year ended ended ended december  december  december  in thousands operating revenue operating expense operating income operating ratio revenue containers units general we believe that we are the nation s leading jones act container shipping and integrated logistics company  accounting for approximately of total us marine container shipments from the continental us to alaska  puerto rico and hawaii  constituting the three non contiguous jones act markets  and to guam and micronesia 
under the jones act  all vessels transporting cargo between us ports must  subject to limited exceptions  be built in the us  registered under the us flag  manned by predominantly us crews  and owned and operated by us organized companies that are controlled and owned by us citizens 
we own or lease vessels  of which are fully qualified jones act vessels  and approximately  cargo containers 
we also provide comprehensive shipping and logistics services in our markets  including rail  trucking and distribution operations 
we have long term access to terminal facilities in each of our ports  operating our terminals in alaska  hawaii  and puerto rico and contracting for terminal services in the five ports in the continental us and in the ports in guam  hong kong  yantian and taiwan 
history and transactions our long operating history dates back to  when sea land pioneered the marine container shipping industry and established our business 
in  we introduced container shipping to the puerto rico market and in we pioneered container shipping in alaska with the first year round scheduled vessel service 
in  we began providing container shipping services between the us west coast and hawaii and guam through our acquisition from an existing carrier of all of its vessels and certain other assets that were already serving that market 
today  as the only jones act vessel operator with an integrated organization serving alaska  puerto rico  and hawaii  we are uniquely positioned to serve our customers that require shipping and logistics services in more than one of these markets 
on february   horizon lines holding which at the time was indirectly majority owned by carlyle horizon partners  lp acquired from csx corporation csx  which was the successor to sea land  of csx lines  llc predecessor  and of csx lines of puerto rico  inc  which together constitute our business today 
csx lines  llc is now known as horizon lines  llc and csx lines of puerto rico  inc is now known as horizon lines of puerto rico  inc 
horizon lines  inc the company  and together with its subsidiaries  we operates as a holding company for horizon lines  llc horizon lines  a delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary  horizon logistics holdings  llc horizon logistics  a delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary  and horizon lines of puerto rico  inc hlpr  a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary 
the company was formed as an acquisition vehicle to acquire  on july   the equity interest in horizon lines holding corp  a delaware corporation hlhc or horizon lines holding 
the foregoing acquisition and related financing and other transactions  referred to in this form k collectively as the acquisition related transactions 
table of contents or merger  included a merger whereby horizon lines holding became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
basis of presentation the company was formed in connection with the acquisition related transactions  and has no independent operations 
consequently  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the company as of december   december  and december  and for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  fiscal year we have a or week every sixth or seventh year fiscal year that ends on the sunday before the last friday in december 
the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  each consisted of weeks 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions in the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and in reporting the amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
since many of these estimates and assumptions are based on future events which cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the application of our critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically re evaluated and adjustments are made when facts or circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
we believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we account for transportation revenue based upon method two under emerging issues task force no 
revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process 
under this method we record transportation revenue for the cargo when shipped and an expense accrual for the corresponding costs to complete delivery when the cargo first sails from its point of origin 
we believe that this method of revenue recognition does not result in a material difference in reported net income on an annual or quarterly basis as compared to recording transportation revenue between accounting periods based upon the relative transit time within each respective period with expenses recognized as incurred 
we recognize revenue and related costs of sales for our terminal and other services upon completion of services 
we recognize revenue from logistics operations as service is rendered 
gross revenue consists of the total dollar value of services purchased by shippers 
revenue and the associated costs for the following services are recognized upon proof of delivery of freight truck brokerage  rail brokerage  expedited international air  expedited domestic ground services  and drayage 
horizon logistics also offers warehousing long term storage for which revenue is recognized based upon warehouse space occupied during the reporting period 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable reflective of our historical collection experience 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation for example  bankruptcy filings  accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for the bad debts against amounts due 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due and other customer specific factors including  type of service provided  geographic location and industry 
we monitor our collection risk on an ongoing basis through the use of credit reporting agencies 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 
we does not require collateral from its trade customers 
in addition  we maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments consisting of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  when billing errors occur  and when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
these revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
casualty claims we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of our exposure related to certain employee injuries workers compensation and compensation under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act  vehicular and vessel collision  accidents and personal injury and cargo claims 
most insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance self retention or deductible applicable to each claim or vessel voyage  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs 
the amounts of self insurance coverage change from time to time 
our current insurance coverage specifies that the self insured limit on claims ranges from to  our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from our insurance companies to continually update the anticipated residual exposure for each claim 
in establishing accruals and reserves for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
changes in the perceived severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
goodwill is reviewed annually  or when events or circumstances dictate  more frequently 
the impairment review for goodwill consists of a two step process of first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no further analysis or write down of goodwill is required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets  the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the underlying assets and liabilities  including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets  based on their fair value 
if necessary  goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 
the indefinite life intangible asset impairment review consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite life intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount  the indefinite life intangible asset is not considered impaired 

table of contents the fair value of a reporting unit is based on quoted market prices  if available 
quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units 
accordingly  we base the fair value of a reporting unit on an expected present value technique 
the expected present value technique for a reporting unit consists of estimating expected future cash flows discounted using a rate commensurate with the business risk 
the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenue  operating costs  marketing  selling and administrative expenses  as well as assumptions regarding the overall shipping and logistics industries  competition  and general economic and business conditions  among other factors 
the majority of the customer contracts and trademarks on the balance sheet as of december  were valued on july   as part of the acquisition related transactions  using the income appraisal methodology 
the income appraisal methodology includes a determination of the present value of future monetary benefits to be derived from the anticipated income  or ownership  of the subject asset 
the value of our customer contracts includes the value expected to be realized from existing contracts as well as from expected renewals of such contracts and is calculated using unweighted and weighted total undiscounted cash flows as part of the income appraisal methodology 
the value of our trademarks and service marks is based on various factors including the strength of the trade or service name in terms of recognition and generation of pricing premiums and enhanced margins 
we amortize customer contracts and trademarks and service marks on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of four to fifteen years 
long lived assets are reviewed annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
such quoted market prices are often not available for our identifiable intangible assets 
accordingly  we base fair value on projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management to be commensurate with the business risk 
the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of revenues  operating costs  marketing  selling and administrative expenses  as well as assumptions regarding the overall shipping and logistics industries  competition  and general economic and business conditions  among other factors 
vessel dry docking under us coast guard rules  administered through the american bureau of shipping s alternative compliance program  all vessels must meet specified seaworthiness standards to remain in service carrying cargo between us marine terminals 
vessels must undergo regular inspection  monitoring and maintenance  referred to as dry docking  to maintain the required operating certificates 
these dry dockings generally occur every two and a half years  or twice every five years 
because dry dockings enable the vessel to continue operating in compliance with us coast guard requirements  the costs of these scheduled dry dockings are customarily deferred and amortized over a month period beginning with the accounting period following the vessel s release from dry dock 
we also take advantage of vessel dry dockings to perform normal repair and maintenance procedures on our vessels 
these routine vessel maintenance and repair procedures are expensed as incurred 
in addition  we will occasionally  during a vessel dry docking  replace vessel machinery or equipment and perform procedures that materially enhance capabilities of a vessel 
in these circumstances  the expenditures are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives 

table of contents deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes that may result in tax deductions in the future and deferred tax liabilities represent expense recognized for tax purposes that may result in financial reporting expenses in the future 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the valuation allowance and income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements 
we record an income tax valuation allowance when the realization of certain deferred tax assets  net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards is not likely 
in conjunction with the election of tonnage tax  we revalued our deferred taxes to accurately reflect the rates at which we expect such items to reverse in future periods 
fin we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board the fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 

the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
as such  we are required to make many assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax positions and the likelihood whether such tax positions would be sustained if challenged 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation in conjunction with the initial public offering  we adopted sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective approach as of september  sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  and employee stock purchase plans 
in applying sfas r  the value of each equity based award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model takes into account volatility in the price of our stock  the risk free interest rate  the estimated life of the equity based award  the closing market price of our stock and the exercise price 
due to the relatively short period of time since our stock became publicly traded  we base our estimates of stock price volatility on the average of i our historical stock price over the period in which it has been publicly traded and ii historical volatility of similar entities commensurate with the expected term of the equity based award  however  this estimate is neither predictive nor indicative of the future performance of our stock 
the estimates utilized in the black scholes calculation involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest 
property and equipment we capitalize property and equipment as permitted or required by applicable accounting standards  including replacements and improvements when costs incurred for those purposes extend the useful life of the asset 
we charge maintenance and repairs to expense as incurred 
depreciation on capital assets is computed using the straight line method and ranges from to years 
our management makes assumptions regarding future conditions in determining estimated useful lives and potential salvage values 
these assumptions impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in the period and any gain or loss once the asset is disposed 
we evaluate each of our long lived assets for impairment using undiscounted future cash flows relating to those assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when undiscounted future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of an asset  the asset is written down to its fair value 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued staff position no 
eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf concludes that unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to receive non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities  and thus  should be included in the two class method of computing earnings per share eps 
fsp eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years

apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion fsp apb 
fsp apb requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
as a result  the liability component would be recorded at a discount reflecting its below market coupon interest rate  and the liability component would subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected life  with the rate of interest that reflects the market rate at issuance being reflected in the results of operations 
this change in methodology will affect the calculations of net income and earnings per share  but will not increase our cash interest payments 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
retrospective application to all periods presented is required and early adoption is prohibited

the adoption did not have a financial impact on our results of operations and financial position 
shipping rates we publish tariffs with rates rules and practices for all three of our jones act trade routes 
these tariffs are subject to regulation by the surface transportation board stb 
however  in the case of our puerto rico and alaska trade routes  we primarily ship containers on the basis of confidential negotiated transportation service contracts that are not subject to rate regulation by the stb 
seasonality our container volumes are subject to seasonal trends common in the transportation industry 
financial results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced loads during the winter months 
volumes typically build to a peak in the third quarter and early fourth quarter  which generally results in higher revenues  improved margins  and increased earnings and cash flows 
results of operations operating revenue overview we derive our revenue primarily from providing comprehensive shipping and logistics services to and from the continental us and alaska  puerto rico  hawaii and guam 
we charge our customers on a per load basis and price our services based primarily on the length of inland and ocean cargo transportation hauls  type of cargo  and other requirements such as shipment timing and type of container 
in addition  we assess fuel surcharges on a basis consistent with industry practice and at times may incorporate these surcharges into our basic transportation rates 
at times  there is a timing disparity between volatility in our fuel costs and related adjustments to our fuel surcharges or the incorporation of adjusted fuel surcharges into our base transportation rates that may result in lower recovery of our fuel costs during sharp hikes in the price of fuel and improvements in recovery of our fuel costs when fuel prices level off or decline 
during  over of our revenue was generated from our shipping and logistics services in markets where the marine trade is subject to the jones act or other us maritime laws 
the balance of our revenue is derived from i vessel loading and unloading services that we provide for vessel operators at our terminals  ii agency services that we provide for third party shippers lacking administrative presences in our markets  iii vessel space charter income from third parties in trade lanes not subject to the jones act  iv management of vessels owned by third parties  v warehousing services for third parties  and vi other non transportation services 
as used in this form k  the term revenue containers refers to containers that are transported for a charge  as opposed to empty containers 

table of contents cost of services overview our cost of services consist primarily of marine operating costs  inland transportation costs  vessel operating costs  land costs and rolling stock rent 
our marine operating costs consist of stevedoring  port charges  wharfage and various other costs to secure vessels at the port and to load and unload containers to and from vessels 
our inland transportation costs consist primarily of the costs to move containers to and from the port via rail  truck or barge 
our vessel operating costs consist primarily of vessel fuel costs  crew payroll costs and benefits  vessel maintenance costs  space charter costs  vessel insurance costs and vessel rent 
we view our vessel fuel costs as subject to potential fluctuation as a result of changes in unit prices in the fuel market 
our land costs consist primarily of maintenance  yard and gate operations  warehousing operations and terminal overhead in the terminals in which we operate 
rolling stock rent consists primarily of rent for street tractors  yard equipment  chassis  gensets and various dry and refrigerated containers

table of contents operating revenue 
operating revenue increased million  or  and accounted for approximately of consolidated operating revenue 
this revenue increase can be attributed to the following factors in thousands bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges included in rates general rate increases increase in other non transportation services revenue related to acquisitions revenue container volume decrease total operating revenue increase the revenue container volume decline is primarily due to deteriorating market conditions in puerto rico and hawaii and is partially offset by general rate increases 
bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges  which are included in our transportation revenue  accounted for approximately of total revenue in the year ended december  and approximately of total revenue in the year ended december  we adjusted our bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges several times throughout and as a result of fluctuations in the cost of fuel for our vessels  in addition to fuel fluctuations passed on to us by our truck  rail  and barge service providers 
fuel surcharges are evaluated regularly as the price of fuel fluctuates  and we may at times incorporate these surcharges into our base transportation rates that we charge 
the increase in non transportation revenue is primarily due to higher space charter revenue resulting from an increase in fuel surcharges  offset by a decrease in terminal services 
cost of services 
the million increase in cost of services is primarily due to an increase in fuel costs as a result of an increase in fuel prices  which is partially offset by reduced expenses associated with lower container volumes and reduced expenses associated with our cost control efforts 
vessel expense  which is not primarily driven by revenue container volume  increased million for the year ended december  this increase can be attributed to the following factors in thousands vessel fuel costs increase vessel lease expense increase labor and other vessel operating decreases total vessel expense increase the million increase in fuel costs is comprised of million increase in fuel prices offset by an million decrease due to lower fuel consumption  despite an increase in vessel operating days 
the decrease in labor and other vessel operating expense is due to lower operating expenses associated with less dry dockings in and million related to certain one time expenses associated with the activation of the new vessels during the year ended december  we continue to incur labor expenses associated with vessels that are in dry dock  while also incurring expenses associated with the spare vessels deployed to serve as dry dock relief 
the reductions were partially offset by higher vessel lay up costs of million during the year ended december  and a supplementary premium call related to our protection and indemnity insurance policy totaling million for the year ended december  marine expense is comprised of the costs incurred to bring vessels into and out of port  and to load and unload containers 
the types of costs included in marine expense are stevedoring and benefits  pilotage fees  tug fees  government fees  wharfage fees  dockage fees  and line handler fees 
marine expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in marine expenses can be attributed to 
table of contents increased stevedoring costs related to contractual rate increases and services provided to third parties as a result of the acquisition of hsi  partially offset by lower container volumes 
inland expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in inland expense is due to million in higher fuel costs and contractual rates increases  offset slightly by lower container volumes 
land expense is comprised of the costs included within the terminal for the handling  maintenance and storage of containers  including yard operations  gate operations  maintenance  warehouse and terminal overhead 
year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands land expense maintenance terminal overhead yard and gate warehouse total land expense non vessel related maintenance expenses increased primarily due to million of additional fuel expenses 
in addition  million of maintenance expenses incurred by hsi was offset by a decrease in overall repair expenses 
the decrease in overall repair expenses is associated with lower volumes and our cost control efforts 
terminal overhead increased primarily due to the acquisition of hsi  an increase in rent expense as a result of the move to our warehouse to compton  california  a severance charge for several union employees who elected early retirement  and labor and other inflationary increases 
yard and gate expense is comprised of the costs associated with moving cargo into and out of the terminal facility and the costs associated with the storage of equipment and revenue loads in the terminal facility

in accordance with sfas  the notes and the warrants sold in connection with the hedge transactions will have no impact on diluted earnings per share until the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price initially per share because the principal amount of the notes will be settled in cash upon conversion 
prior to conversion of the notes or exercise of the warrants  we will include the effect of the additional shares that may be issued if its common stock price exceeds the conversion price  using the treasury stock method 
the call options purchased as part of the note hedge transactions are anti dilutive and therefore will have no impact on earnings per share
