statements in our discussion may be forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution that a number of factors could cause future production  revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations 

table of contents overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration of producing oil and natural gas properties 
our core operations are primarily focused in the permian basin of southeastern new mexico and west texas 
we have also acquired significant acreage positions in and are actively involved in drilling or participating in drilling in emerging plays located in the permian basin of southeastern new mexico and the williston basin in north dakota  where we are applying horizontal drilling  advanced fracture stimulation and enhanced recovery technologies 
crude oil comprised percent of our mmboe of estimated net proved reserves at december   and percent of our mmboe of production for we seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest  and we operated wells that accounted for percent of our proved developed producing pv and percent of our  gross wells at december  by controlling operations  we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties  including the drilling and stimulation methods used 
commodity prices factors that may impact future commodity prices  including the price of oil and natural gas  include developments generally impacting the middle east and iraq and iran specifically  the extent to which members of the opec and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil supply through export quotas  the overall global demand for crude oil  and overall north american gas supply and demand fundamentals  including the impact of the decline of the us economy  weather conditions and liquefied natural gas deliveries to the united states 
although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected  the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production 
from time to time  we expect that we may hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business
