item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide human resource management services  comprised principally of staffing services and peo services 
we generate staffing services revenues primarily from short term staffing  contract staffing  on site management and direct placement services 
our peo service fees are generated from contractual agreements with our peo clients under which we become a co employer of our client s workforce with responsibility for some or all of the client s human resource functions 
we recognize revenues from our staffing services for all amounts invoiced  including direct payroll  employer payroll related taxes  workers compensation coverage and a service fee equivalent to a mark up percentage 
peo service fee revenues are recognized on a net basis in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf no 

consequently  our peo service fee revenues represent the gross margin generated from our peo services after deducting the amounts invoiced to peo customers for direct payroll expenses such as salaries  wages  health insurance and employee out of pocket expenses incurred incidental to employment 
these amounts are also excluded from cost of revenues 
peo service fees also include amounts invoiced to our clients for employer payroll related taxes and workers compensation coverage 
through centralized operations at our headquarters in vancouver  washington  we prepare invoices weekly for our staffing services customers and following the end of each payroll processing cycle for peo clients 
we invoice our customers and clients as each payroll is processed 
payment terms for staffing customers are generally days  while peo clients invoices are generally due on the invoice date 
our business is concentrated in california and oregon and we expect to continue to derive a majority of our revenues from these markets in the future 
revenues generated in our california and oregon offices accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in consequently  any weakness in economic conditions or changes in the regulatory environments in these regions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we offer cash safety incentives to certain peo clients for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the cash incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all workers compensation claims incurred during the customer s contract period 
the safety incentive expense is also netted against peo revenues on our statements of operations 
our cost of revenues is comprised of direct payroll costs for staffing services  employer payroll related taxes and employee benefits and workers compensation 
direct payroll costs represent the gross payroll earned by staffing services employees based on salary or hourly wages 
payroll taxes and employee benefits consist of the employer s portion of social security and medicare taxes  federal unemployment taxes  state unemployment taxes and staffing services employee reimbursements for materials  supplies and other 
table of contents expenses  which are paid by the customer 
workers compensation expense consists primarily of the costs associated with our self insured workers compensation program  such as claims reserves  claims administration fees  legal fees  state administrative agency fees and excess insurance costs for catastrophic injuries 
we also maintain separate workers compensation insurance policies for employees working in states where we are not self insured 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to us  our respective independent third party claims administrator tpa or our internal claims management personnel analyze the details of the injury and develop a case reserve  which becomes the estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and their professional judgment 
we then record or accrue an expense and a corresponding liability based upon our estimate of the ultimate claim cost 
as cash payments are made by our tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa and our in house claims administrators also review existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjust the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
our reserve includes a provision for both future anticipated increases in costs adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods 
we believe our operational policies and internal claims reporting system help to limit the occurrence of unreported incurred claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent both branch office and corporate level operating expenses 
branch operating expenses consist primarily of branch office staff payroll and personnel related costs  advertising  rent  office supplies  depreciation and branch incentive compensation 
corporate level operating expenses consist primarily of executive and office staff payroll and personnel related costs  professional and legal fees  travel  depreciation  occupancy costs  information systems costs and executive and corporate staff incentive compensation 
amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of software costs  covenants not to compete  and if material  customer related intangibles 
these costs are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to ten years 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents self insured workers compensation reserves 
we are self insured for workers compensation coverage in a majority of our employee work sites in oregon  california  maryland  delaware and colorado and for staffing services and management employees only in washington 
the estimated liability for unsettled workers compensation claims represents our best estimate  which includes an evaluation of information provided by our internal claims adjusters and our third party claims administrators  coupled with management s evaluations of historical claims development and conversion factors and other trends 
these elements serve as the basis for our overall estimate for workers compensation claims liabilities  which include more specifically the following components case reserve estimates for reported losses  plus additional amounts for estimated future development of reported claims and incurred but not reported claims together ibnr 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments to liabilities are reflected in current operating results as they become known 
we believe that the amounts recorded for our estimated liabilities are reasonable and objective and are based upon facts and development factors and other trends associated with the company s historical universe of claims data 
nevertheless  it is reasonably possible that adjustments to such estimates may be required in future periods if the development of claim costs varies materially from our estimates and such adjustments  if necessary  could be material to results of operations 
safety incentives liability 
our accrued safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all workers compensation claims incurred during the customer s contract period 
the liability is estimated and accrued each month based upon the then current amount of the customer s estimated workers compensation claims reserves as established by our internal claims adjusters and our third party administrators 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables 
management analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in the customers payment tendencies when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill 
we assess the recoverability of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might be impaired 
factors that are considered include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry trends and significant change in the manner of use of the acquired assets 
management s current assessment of the carrying value of goodwill indicates there was no impairment as of december  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets  as of the date of our annual assessment on december investments in marketable securities 
we consider available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments  including the duration and extent to which fair value is less than cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
investments in securities 
table of contents classified as trading are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains or losses reported in other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
investments in securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
in the event a loss on our available for sale investments is determined to be other than temporary  the loss will be recognized in our statement of operations 
income taxes 
our incomes taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach 
this requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the impact of uncertain tax positions would be recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge  if any  from taxing authorities 
as facts and circumstances change  we reassess these probabilities and would record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate 
on january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which sets out the framework by which such judgments are to be made

results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by selected items in the company s statements of operations for the years ended december   and  included in item of this report 
references to the notes to financial statements appearing below are to the notes to the company s financial statements included in item of this report 
percentage of total net revenues year ended december  revenues staffing services professional employer service fees total cost of revenues direct payroll costs payroll taxes and benefits workers compensation total gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations loss on impairment of investments other income pretax income provision for income taxes net income we report peo revenues in accordance with the requirements of eitf no 
which requires us to report such revenues on a net basis because we are not the primary obligor for the services provided by our peo clients to their customers pursuant to our peo contracts 
we present for comparison purposes the gross revenues and cost of revenues information for the years ended december  and set forth in the table below 

table of contents although not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management believes this information is more informative as to the level of our business activity and more illustrative of how we manage our operations  including the preparation of our internal operating forecasts  because it presents our peo services on a basis comparable to our staffing services 
the presentation of revenues on the net basis and the relative contributions of staffing and peo revenues can create volatility in our gross margin percentage 
the general impact of fluctuations in our revenue mix is described below 
a relative increase in staffing revenues will typically result in a lower gross margin percentage 
staffing revenues are presented at gross with the related direct costs reported in cost of sales 
while staffing relationships typically have higher margins than peo relationships  an increase in staffing revenues and related costs presented at gross dilutes the impact of the net peo revenue on gross margin percentage 
a relative increase in peo revenue will result in higher gross margin percentage 
improvement in gross margin percentage occurs because incremental peo revenue dollars are reported as revenue net of all related direct costs

peo service fee revenue decreased approximately million or from primarily due to a decline in business with our existing peo customer base resulting from challenging economic conditions 
staffing service revenue increased approximately million or over primarily due to the acquisitions of strategic staffing on july   phillips temps on december  and first employment services on february  the increase was offset in part by a decline in business with existing or former customers in excess of market share gains attributable to new customers 
on a comparable branch office basis  ie without the benefit from the incremental revenue generated from the three acquisitions  staffing revenues for the year declined or approximately million due to a decrease in demand for staffing employees resulting from slower economic conditions in the company s markets 
during  the company served approximately  staffing service customers  which compares to a similar number of customers during management expects demand for the company s staffing services will continue to reflect overall uncertain economic conditions in its market areas 
during  the company served approximately  peo clients  which compares to approximately  peo clients during offsetting the increase in the number of peo clients served in was a decline in the average number of peo employees and worker hours per client 
net growth in the company s peo business has slowed due to general economic conditions 
gross margin for totaled approximately million  which represented a decrease of million or from  primarily due to the decline in revenues and higher cost of revenues 
the gross margin percent decreased from of revenues for to for the decline in the gross margin percentage was mainly due to higher direct payroll costs  expressed as a percent of revenues 
the increase in direct payroll costs  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for reflects the moderate shift in the overall mix of services from peo services to staffing services in the company s customer base primarily attributable to the acquisitions of strategic staffing  phillips temps and first employment services and the effect of each customer s unique mark up percent 
workers compensation expense  as a percent of revenues  increased from in to in workers compensation expense for totaled million  which compares to million for this increase was primarily due to higher estimates for new claim costs and to increases in estimates for existing claims in states where the company is self insured as well as to higher insurance premiums in states where the company is not self insured 
the small increase in payroll taxes and benefits  as a 
table of contents percentage of revenues  from for to for  was primarily due to the effect of growth in staffing services  as well as slightly higher effective state unemployment tax rates in various states in which the company operates as compared to we expect gross margin as a percentage of total revenues to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  as well as changes to our estimates for workers compensation claims liabilities  if necessary 
during  the company recorded a non cash  other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million relating to its investment in four closed end bond funds 
the impairment charge assumes no income tax benefit given the uncertainty of the company s ability to generate future taxable investment gains required to utilize these investment losses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses relating to the operation of our headquarters and our branch offices and the marketing of our services 
sg a for amounted to approximately million  an increase of million or over sg a expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased from in to in the increase over was primarily attributable to increases in branch management personnel and related expenses as a result of the incremental sg a expenses associated with the strategic staffing  phillips temps and first employment services acquisitions  which represented million  offset in part by lower sg a expenses from our existing branch offices 
on a comparable branch basis  sg a expenses declined million primarily due to lower profit sharing 
other income for was million compared to other income of million for the decline in other income for was primarily attributable to decreased investment income earned on the company s cash and investments due to a decline in investment yields

at december   we had deferred income tax assets of million  which consist of temporary differences between taxable income for financial accounting and tax purposes  which will reduce taxable income in future years 
pursuant to gaap  we are required to assess the realization of the deferred income tax assets as significant changes in circumstances may require adjustments during future periods 
although realization is not assured  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred income tax assets will be realized  principally based upon projected taxable income for the next two years 
the amount of the deferred income tax assets actually realized could 
table of contents vary  if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred income tax assets or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income as compared to operating forecasts 
if our operating forecast is determined to no longer be reliable due to uncertain market conditions  our long term forecast may require reassessment 
as a result  in the future  a valuation allowance may be required to be established for all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets 
such a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
years ended december  and net income for amounted to million  an improvement of or  over net income of million for the improvement for was primarily due to higher gross margin dollars as a result of significant growth in our staffing business  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses

staffing service revenue increased approximately million or over primarily due to the acquisitions of strategic staffing on july  and phillips temps on december  the increase was offset in part by a decline in business with existing or former customers in excess of market share gains attributable to new customers 
on a comparable branch office basis  staffing revenues for the year declined or approximately  during  the company served approximately  staffing service customers  which compares to approximately  customers during peo service fee revenue increased approximately million or over the comparable period primarily due to the net effect from the addition of new client companies

our effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the lower effective rate was primarily attributable to increases in federal tax credits and federal tax exempt interest income 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results we have historically experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and expect such fluctuations to continue in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as seasonality  wage limits on statutory payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand for our services and competition and the effect of acquisitions 
payroll taxes  as a component of cost of revenues  generally decline throughout a calendar year as the applicable statutory wage bases for federal and state unemployment taxes and social security taxes are exceeded on a per employee basis 
our revenue levels may be higher in the third quarter due to the effect of increased business activity of our customers businesses in the agriculture  food processing and forest products related industries 
in addition  revenues in the fourth quarter may be affected by many customers practice of operating on holiday shortened schedules 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter and the estimated future costs of such claims 
in addition  adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter may also contribute to the volatility in the company s estimated workers compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position of million at december   increased by million from december   which compares to a decrease of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash at december   as compared to december   was primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million and net income of million  offset in part by purchases of marketable securities of million and the company s repurchase of its common stock of million and cash used for acquisitions of million

as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  the company acquired certain assets of strategic staffing  inc  a privately held staffing services company with five offices in utah and one office in colorado springs  colorado  effective july  the company paid million in cash on the effective date for the assets of strategic staffing and the selling shareholders non compete agreements and agreed to pay additional consideration based upon the level of financial performance achieved by the strategic staffing offices during the ensuing month period 
management completed the evaluation of the financial performance criteria for the month period during the third quarter of and paid million of additional consideration 
the company also acquired certain assets of phillips temps  inc  a privately held staffing services company with an office in downtown denver  colorado  effective december  the company paid million in cash for the assets of phillips temps and the selling shareholders noncompete agreements and paid an additional  on march  there was no contingent consideration 
also  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  the company acquired certain assets of first employment services  inc  a privately held staffing services company with offices in tempe and phoenix  arizona  effective february  as consideration for the acquisition  the company paid million in cash and agreed to pay additional consideration of million contingent upon the first months of financial performance 
management completed the evaluation of the financial performance criteria for the month period during the first quarter of and determined no additional consideration was due 
the company s business strategy continues to focus on growth through the expansion of operations at existing offices  together with the selective acquisition of additional personnel related business  both in its existing markets and other strategic geographic markets 
the company periodically evaluates proposals for various acquisition opportunities  but there can be no assurance that any additional transactions will be consummated 
the company entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with its principal bank effective july  the credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to million  which includes a subfeature under the line of credit for standby letters of credit up to million 
the interest rate on advances will be  at 
table of contents the company s discretion  either i equal to the prime rate or ii libor plus 
the credit agreement expires july  management anticipates that if it chooses to renew the credit agreement  terms and conditions for a new agreement will not be less favorable than the current agreement 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the company is required to maintain compliance with the following covenants net income after taxes not less than one dollar on an annual basis  determined as of each fiscal year end  and pre tax profit of not less than one dollar on a quarterly basis  determined as of each fiscal quarter end 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  effective november   the company s board of directors approved management s recommendation to discontinue certain business insurance policies 
such policies  in the aggregate  required annual premiums of approximately  and provided insured limits ranging from the relatively small value of personal property in the company s branch offices to million general liability coverage with umbrella coverage of an additional million 
it is the company s determination that the risk of loss under such prior insurance policies is remote  therefore  the company became self insured for such risks effective november   except for its errors and omissions insurance coverage which was cancelled effective december  management may explore in the future more cost effective vehicles to provide higher limits of coverage  as well as coverages provided by the company s captive insurance company 
during  the board authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  common shares from time to time in open market purchases 
during november  the board approved an increase in the total number of shares to be repurchased under the program up to a total of million common shares 
in october  the board approved a second increase in the authorized shares to be repurchased up to million shares 
the repurchase program currently permits million of additional shares to be repurchased at december  management anticipates that the capital necessary to execute this program will be provided by existing cash balances and other available resources 
management expects that current liquid assets  coupled with the funds anticipated to be generated from operations and credit available under the credit agreement  will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december   including commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and long term workers compensation liabilities  are summarized below payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases long term workers compensation claims liabilities for catastrophic injuries total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to its investment portfolio of liquid assets 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted principally of approximately million in tax exempt money market funds  million in tax exempt municipal bonds with an average maturity of days  and approximately million in bond funds and corporate bonds 
based on the company s overall interest exposure at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s investment portfolio of liquid assets or its results of operations because of the predominantly short maturities of the securities within the investment portfolio
