item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in this report and the information referred to in that discussion is incorporated by reference in this paragraph 
the company makes certain estimates and judgments in preparing its financial statements 
the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the company s customer relationship management and systems 
there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately corrected by the company 
the occurrence of any such failures  interruptions or security breaches could damage the company s reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose the company to litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal control over financial reporting  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
the company maintains controls and procedures to mitigate against risks such as processing system failures and errors  and customer or employee fraud  and maintains insurance coverage for certain of these risks 
any system of controls and procedures  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
events could occur which are not prevented or detected by the company s internal controls or are not insured against or are in excess of the company s insurance limits 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may have difficulty integrating the branches and operations of the former county bank 
on february   the bank acquired approximately billion in assets  including loans  and billion in deposits of the former county bank  of merced  california  from the fdic as its receiver 
county bank s loan portfolio had suffered substantial deterioration over the previous year  and the company can provide no assurance that it will not continue to deteriorate now that it is part of the bank s portfolio 
if management s estimates of the losses are too low  the recorded fair values for the loans may need to be reduced with a corresponding charge to earnings 
in addition  integrating county bank s branches  employees and customers will require substantial expense and management efforts 
if the company consolidates branches  the company risks attrition in deposits and customers 
shares of company common stock eligible for future sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for company common stock and could adversely affect the market price 
the articles of incorporation of the company authorize the issuance of million shares of common stock and two additional classes of million shares each  denominated class b common stock and preferred stock  respectively of which approximately million were outstanding at december  pursuant to its stock option plans  at december   the company had exercisable options outstanding of million 
as of december   million shares of company common stock remained available for grants under the company s stock option plans 
sales of substantial amounts of company common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of its common stock 
the company repurchases and retires its common stock in accordance with board of directors approved share repurchase programs 
at december   approximately million shares remained available to repurchase under such plans 
the agreement between the company and the united states treasury limits the company s ability to pay dividends on and repurchase the company s common stock 
the securities purchase agreement between the company and the treasury pursuant to which the company sold million of the company s series a preferred stock the treasury preferred stock and issued a warrant to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock the tarp warrant provides that prior to the earlier of i february  and ii the date on which all of the shares of the treasury preferred stock have been redeemed by the company or transferred by the treasury to third parties  the company may not  without the consent of the treasury  a increase the cash dividend on the company s common stock above per share  the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to october  or b subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of the company s common stock or preferred stock other than the treasury preferred stock 
in addition  the company is unable to pay any dividends on the company s common stock unless the company is current in the company s dividend payments on the treasury preferred stock 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the tarp warrant described in the next risk factor  could have a negative effect on the value of the company s common stock 
moreover  holders of the company s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if declared by the company s board of directors 
although the company has historically paid cash dividends on the company s common stock  the company is not required to do so and the company s board of directors could reduce or eliminate the company s common stock dividend in the future 
the treasury preferred stock impacts net income available to the company s common stockholders and earnings per common share  and the tarp warrant may be dilutive to holders of the company s common stock 
the dividends declared and the accretion of the discount on the treasury preferred stock will reduce the net income available to common stockholders and the company s earnings per common share 
the treasury preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company 
additionally  the ownership interest of the 
table of contents existing holders of the company s common stock will be diluted to the extent the tarp warrant is exercised 
the shares of common stock underlying the tarp warrant represent approximately of the shares of the company s common stock outstanding as of february  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the tarp warrant in total shares outstanding 
although the treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the tarp warrant  a transferee of any portion of the tarp warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the tarp warrant is not bound by this restriction 
because of the company s participation in the troubled asset relief program  the company is subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to the company s executives 
pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement  the company adopted certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the initial selling shareholder holds the equity issued pursuant to the securities purchase agreement  including the common stock which may be issued pursuant to the tarp warrant 
these standards generally apply to the company s chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers 
the standards include ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation will likely increase the overall cost of the company s compensation programs in future periods 
since the tarp warrant has a ten year term  the company could potentially be subject to the executive compensation and corporate governance restrictions for a ten year time period 
pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act of  further compensation restrictions  including significant limitations on incentive compensation and golden parachute payments  have been imposed on the company s most highly compensated employees  which may make it more difficult for the company to retain and recruit qualified personnel

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of westamerica bancorporation and subsidiaries the company that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages through  as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make certain estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses accounting to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount of loss in the loan portfolio that can be reasonably estimated as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and interpretation of current economic trends  uncertainties and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the credit quality discussion below 
acquisition on february   the bank entered a purchase and assumption agreement the agreement with the federal deposit insurance corporation as receiver receiver of county bank county 
at february   county s accounting records reflected total assets to be purchased by the bank of approximately billion  total loans to be purchased by the bank of approximately billion  and total deposits to be assumed by the bank of approximately billion

components of net interest income year ended december  in thousands interest and fee income interest expense fte adjustment net interest income fte net interest margin fte the company s net interest margin expanded in compared with the federal reserve s open market committee fomc reduced the target federal funds rate from in august to between zero and in december in ten increments 
as a result  short term interest rates declined and the company managed to reduce the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities during compared with in  the company s loan and investment yields were less sensitive to changes in interest rates resulting in a lesser reduction in such yields compared with the rates paid on deposits and other funding sources 
offsetting some of the benefit of the expanding margin was the reduction in the level of average interest earning assets and lower yields on loans resulting in a reduction of interest and fee income fte of million or in relative to comparing with  average earning assets decreased million or in compared with  due to a million decline in the investment portfolio and a million decrease in the loan portfolio 
lower average investment balances were largely attributable to us government sponsored entity obligations down million  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations down million  municipal securities down million and corporate and other securities down million 
the average balance of corporate and other securities declined largely due to sales and impairment of fhlmc and fnma preferred stock 
the loan portfolio decline was primarily due to decreases in the average balances of commercial real estate loans down million  residential real estate loans down million  tax exempt commercial loans down million  partly offset by an million increase in the average balance of consumer loans  primarily automobile loans 
the average yield on the company s earning assets decreased from in to in the composite yield on loans fell basis points bp to due to decreases in yields on taxable commercial loans down bp  real estate construction loans down bp  consumer loans down bp and commercial real estate loans down bp  partially offset by higher yields on tax exempt commercial loans up bp and residential real estate loans up bp 
real estate construction loans and commercial lines of credit have variable interest rates based on the prime lending rate 
the prime lending rate averaged in compared to in  reducing the yields earned on real estate construction loans and commercial lines of credit 
the investment portfolio yield increased bp to  mainly due to higher yields on us government sponsored entity obligations up bp  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations up bp and municipal securities up bp  partially offset by corporate and other securities down bp 
other securities yields declined mostly due to reduced dividends on fhlmc preferred stock 
as investment portfolio balances have declined over the past year  municipal security balances have declined at a slower rate than the remainder of the investment portfolio 
as a result  average municipal securities represented of total average investment security balances during  compared with during this migration in the composition of the investment portfolio has improved the overall yield of the investment portfolio since municipal security yields exceed the yield of the overall investment portfolio 

table of contents in management s opinion  current economic conditions are not conducive for generating profitable loan growth 
recent downward pressure on real estate values create a cautious view toward real estate lending  and economic pressure on consumers has reduced demand for automobile and other consumer loans 
additionally  yields available on the highest quality investment securities do not offer an adequate profit margin over the cost of funding 
as a result  the company has not taken an aggressive posture relative to current loan and investment portfolio growth 
net interest income in included million in dividends on fnma and fhlmc preferred stock  however  there will be no dividend income from such preferred stock in seventy percent of such dividends are excludable from taxable income for federal income tax purposes

the decline was partially offset by a million increase in preferred money market savings 
interest and fee income fte decreased in by million or from  the net result of a lower volume of average earning assets  partially mitigated by higher yields on earning assets 
average earning assets declined by million 
management allowed the investment portfolio to liquidate in as  in management s opinion  rates available on high quality securities did not provide yields adequate to support long term profitability 
average investment security balances decreased million due to declines in the average balances of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations down million  municipal securities down million  us government sponsored entity obligations down million and other securities down million 
the decline in loans is due to heightened competition with reduced yields and liberalized underwriting standards 
management maintained more conservative underwriting standards and higher pricing relative to competitors  which limited loan origination volumes 
the loan portfolio declined million mainly due to decreases in the average volumes of commercial loans down million  commercial real estate loans down million  residential real estate loans down million and consumer credit lines down million  offset in part by a million increase in indirect automobile loans 
management grew indirect automobile loan volumes as rates on loan originations exceeded the average existing portfolio rates  causing the yield to increase on such loans 
the average yield on the company s earning assets increased from in to in the composite yield on loans rose bp to due to increases in rates earned on indirect auto and other consumer loans up bp  residential real estate loans up bp and construction loans up bp  partially offset by decreases in yields on taxable commercial loans down bp and tax exempt commercial loans down bp 
the investment portfolio yield increased bp to  mainly caused by increases in the yield on us 
government sponsored entity obligations up bp and mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations up bp and corporate and other securities up bp  partially offset by a bp decline in municipal securities 
the decline in the yield on municipal securities was attributable to yields on maturities  calls and serial payments exceeding yields on securities remaining in the portfolio 
interest expense in increased million or compared the increase was attributable to higher rates paid on the interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by lower average balances of interest bearing deposits 
competition for deposits was heightened in due to loan growth exceeding deposit growth in the banking industry 
the level of short term interest rates also supported consumer demand for interest bearing deposit products 
due to both of these general conditions  interest rates rose on deposits and banks competed fiercely for deposit balances 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from in to in rates on deposits increased bp to primarily due to increases in rates paid on preferred money market savings up bp  non public cds over thousand up bp and cds less than thousand up bp 
rates on short term borrowings also increased bp mostly due to higher rates on federal funds up bp and line of credit and repurchase facilities up bp 
interest bearing liabilities declined million in compared with interest bearing deposits decreased million primarily due to decreases in money market savings down million  regular savings down million  money market checking accounts down million  non public cds over thousand down million 
the decline was partially offset by increases in preferred money market savings up million and public cds up million

credit quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk and to maintain broad diversification within the loan portfolio 
loan reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
loans receiving lesser grades fall under the classified category  which includes all nonperforming and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection 
foreclosed or repossessed loan collateral  other real estate owned oreo  is adjusted to fair value less costs to sell upon transfer to oreo 
subsequently  oreo is recorded at the lower of cost or appraised value less disposal cost

at december   million of loans or of total classified loans are graded substandard 
such substandard loans accounted for of total gross loans at december  classified assets at december   increased million from a year ago 
the increase is primarily attributable to two classified construction loan relationships 
portions of the loan collateral for one of the construction loans have been foreclosed and represent million of other real estate owned at december  the remaining carrying value of the two construction loans is million at december  management aggressively pursues collection of all classified assets 
nonperforming loans and other real estate owned nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming delinquent days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on nonaccrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonaccrual loans 
when the ability to fully collect nonaccrual loan principal is in doubt  payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional interest payments received after that time are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
nonaccrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal

management believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to be stable  however  nonperforming assets could fluctuate from period to period 
the performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as collateral values  the interest rate environment  economic conditions or factors particular to the borrower 
no assurance can be given that additional increases in nonperforming loans and other real estate owned will not occur in the future 
allowance for credit losses the company s allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions 
these include conditions unique to individual borrowers  as well as overall credit loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
a portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to impaired loans whose full collectibility is uncertain 
such allocations are determined by management based on loan by loan analyses 
a second allocation is based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified credit balances identified through an independent internal credit review process are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard loss rates 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the reserve to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed and reserves established based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends  grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent 
last  allocations are made to non criticized and non classified commercial loans and residential real estate loans based on historical loss rates  and other statistical data 
the remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated 
the unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance 
it addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with management s analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio  which are related to the risks of the company s general lending activity 
included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have not yet been recognized in past loan charge off history external 
table of contents factors 
the external factors evaluated by the company include economic and business conditions  external competitive issues  and other factors 
also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the company s loan portfolio and credit administration internal factors 
the internal factors evaluated by the company include loan review system  adequacy of lending management and staff  loan policies and procedures  problem loan trends  concentrations of credit  and other factors 
by their nature  these risks are not readily allocable to any specific loan category in a statistically meaningful manner and are difficult to quantify with a specific number 
management assigns a range of estimated risk to the qualitative risk factors described above based on management s judgment as to the level of risk  and assigns a quantitative risk factor from the range of loss estimates to determine the appropriate level of the unallocated portion of the allowance 
management considers the million allowance for credit losses to be adequate as a reserve against losses as of december  the following table summarizes the loan loss experience of the company for the periods indicated allowance for credit losses  chargeoffs recoveries year ended december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding average loans outstanding during the period analysis of the allowance balance  beginning of period provision for loan losses provision for unfunded credit commitments allowance acquired through merger loans charged off commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total chargeoffs recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total recoveries net loan losses balance  end of period components allowance for loan losses reserve for unfunded credit commitments allowance for credit losses net loan losses to average loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding effective december   the company transferred the portion of the allowance for credit losses related to lending commitments and letters of credit to other liabilities

annualized net loan losses to average loans rose to in  compared to in no assurance can be given that higher levels of net charge offs will not occur 
management continues to follow conservative credit underwriting policies and practices  and aggressively pursues collection of classified loans and recovery of recognized loan losses

the decline in the allocation to real estate construction loans reflects a decrease in criticized real estate construction loans and the increase in allocation to consumer loans reflects delinquency trends 
the allocation to loan portfolio segments changed from december  to december  the increase in allocation for commercial loans reflects an increase in historical loss rates 
the increase in allocation to real estate construction loans reflects an increase in criticized construction loans outstanding  which receive higher allocations due to higher risk attributes  offset in part by lower volumes of non criticized construction loans and construction loan commitments 
the reduced allocations for residential real estate loans reflects refinements to the statistical model used to apply historical loss rates to loan volumes 
the increased allocation for consumer loans reflects higher delinquencies in automobile loans 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses declined million from december  to december  the unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred  but not reflected in the allocated allowance 
during  classified loans  nonperforming loans and consumer loan delinquencies increased  as a result  the allocated allowance reflects probable losses related to these loans and the unallocated allowance has declined

table of contents impaired loans the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to smaller balance loans that are collectively evaluated for credit risk 
in assessing impairment  the company reviews all nonaccrual commercial and construction loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of thousand 
nonaccrual commercial and construction loans with outstanding principal balances less than thousand  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the following summarizes the company s recorded investment in impaired loans for the dates indicated impaired loans at december  dollars in thousands total impaired loans specific reserves at december  and  the company measured impairment using the fair value of loan collateral 
the average balance of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  was million compared with thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
all impaired loans are on nonaccrual status 
asset liability and market risk management asset liability management involves the evaluation  monitoring and management of interest rate risk  market risk  liquidity and funding 
the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is a significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk results from many factors 
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts 
short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts 
the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change 
in addition  interest rates may have an impact on loan demand  credit losses  and other sources of earnings such as account analysis fees on commercial deposit accounts and correspondent bank service charges 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing the net interest margin and net interest income 
at times  depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may adjust the company s interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
the company s asset and liability position remains slightly liability sensitive  with a greater amount of interest bearing liabilities subject to immediate and near term interest rate changes relative to earning assets 
as a result  the fomc s recent reductions in the federal funds target rate charged for short term inter bank borrowings and the related decline in us treasury bill rates has improved the company s net interest margin in the twelve months ended december  management continues to monitor the interest rate environment as well as economic conditions and other factors it deems relevant in managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 

table of contents management assesses interest rate risk by comparing the company s most likely earnings plan with various earnings models using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes  the degree of change over time  the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve 
for example  using the current composition of the company s balance sheet and assuming no change in the federal funds rate and an increase of bp in the year constant maturity treasury bond yield during the same period  earnings are not estimated to change by a meaningful amount compared to the company s most likely net income plan for the twelve months ending december  conversely  using the current composition of the company s balance sheet and assuming an increase of bp in the federal funds rate and an increase of bp in the year constant maturity treasury bond yield during the same period  estimated earnings at risk would be approximately of the company s most likely net income plan for the twelve months ending december  simulation estimates depend on  and will change with  the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation 
management is currently deploying tactics to reduce the liability sensitivity of the company s balance sheet to a more neutral condition where changes in interest rates result in less significant changes in earnings 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company s board of directors 
market risk equity markets equity price risk can affect the company 
as an example  any preferred or common stock holdings  as permitted by banking regulations  can fluctuate in value 
management regularly assesses the extent and duration of any declines in market value  the causes of such declines  the likelihood of a recovery in market value  and its intent to hold securities until a recovery in value occurs 
declines in value of preferred or common stock holdings that are deemed other than temporary could result in loss recognition in the company s income statement 
fluctuations in the company s common stock price can impact the company s financial results in several ways 
first  the company has regularly repurchased and retired its common stock  the market price paid to retire the company s common stock can affect the level of the company s shareholders equity  cash flows and shares outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share 
on february   the company issued preferred stock to the treasury the terms of such issuance limits the company s ability to repurchase stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
second  the company s common stock price impacts the number of dilutive equivalent shares used to compute diluted earnings per share 
third  fluctuations in the company s common stock price can motivate holders of options to purchase company common stock through the exercise of such options thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding 
finally  the amount of compensation expense associated with share based compensation fluctuates with changes in and the volatility of the company s common stock price 
market risk other market values of loan collateral can directly impact the level of loan chargeoffs and the provision for loan losses 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  are not significant in the normal course of the company s business activities 
liquidity and funding the company s routine operating sources of liquidity are operating earnings  investment securities  consumer and other loans  deposits  and other borrowed funds 
during  investment securities provided million in liquidity from paydowns and maturities  and loans provided million in liquidity from scheduled payments and maturities  net of loan fundings 
the company projects million in additional liquidity from investment security paydowns and maturities in the three months ending march  at december   indirect automobile loans totaled million  which were experiencing stable monthly principal payments of approximately million during the last three month of during  a portion of the liquidity provided by investment securities and loans provided funds to meet a net reduction in deposits totaling million 
the remaining liquidity was used to reduce higher cost borrowed funds  primarily subordinated debt which decreased million and federal funds purchased which declined million

at december   million in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and mortgage backed securities mbss were held in the company s investment portfolios 
none of the cmos or mbss are backed by sub prime mortgages 
all of the non agency cmos are rated aaa based on their subordination structures without reliance on monoline insurance 
other than nominal amounts of fhlmc and fnma mbss purchased for community reinvestment act investment purposes  the company has not purchased a cmo or mbs since november the cmos and mbss have been experiencing stable principal paydowns of approximately million per month during the last three months 
in addition  at december   the company had customary lines for overnight borrowings from other financial institutions in excess of million  under which million was outstanding 
additionally  the company has access to borrowing from the federal reserve 
the company s short term debt rating from fitch ratings is f the company s long term debt rating from fitch ratings is a with a stable outlook 
management expects the company could access additional long term debt financing if desired 
in management s judgment  the company s liquidity position is strong and asset liquidations or additional long term debt are considered unnecessary to meet the ongoing liquidity needs of the company 
the fdic adopted the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp because of disruptions in the credit markets 
the tlgp guarantees newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks and certain holding companies in addition to providing full coverage of noninterest bearing deposit transaction accounts 
debt issuance is subject to a maximum acount  and fees for use of the program are assessed on a sliding scale 
the company did not opt out of this program

it is anticipated that loan demand will be weak during  although such demand will be dictated by economic and competitive conditions 
the company aggressively solicits non interest bearing demand deposits and money market checking deposits  which are the least sensitive to interest rates 
the growth of deposit balances is subject to heightened competition  the success of the company s sales efforts  delivery of superior customer service and market conditions 
the recent series of reductions in the federal funds rate resulted in declining short term interest rates  which could impact deposit volumes in the future 
depending on economic conditions  interest rate levels  and a variety of other conditions  deposit growth may be used to fund loans  to reduce short term borrowings or purchase investment securities 
however  due to concerns such as uncertainty in the general economic environment  competition and political uncertainty  loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain
