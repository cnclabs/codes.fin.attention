the federal banking agencies adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing the construction of a building or other improvements to real estate 
under the joint regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies  all insured depository institutions  such as waterstone bank  must adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate

the real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies that have been adopted by the federal bank regulators

although no supervisory loan to value limit has been established for owner occupied  one to four family and home equity loans  the interagency guidelines state that for any such loan with a loan to value ratio that equals or exceeds at origination  an institution should require appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral

in addition  certain noninterest bearing transaction accounts maintained with financial institutions participating in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program are fully insured regardless of the dollar amount until december  the fdic imposes an assessment against all depository institutions for deposit insurance 
this assessment is based on the risk category of the institution and  prior to  ranged from to basis points of the institution s deposits 
on october   as a result of decreases in the reserve ratio of the dif  the fdic issued a proposed rule establishing a restoration plan for the dif 
the rulemaking proposed that  effective january   assessment rates would increase uniformly by basis points for the first quarter assessment period 
effective april   the rulemaking proposed to alter the way in which the fdic s risk based assessment system differentiates for risk and set new deposit insurance assessment rates 
under the proposed rule  the fdic would first establish an institution s initial base assessment rate 
this initial base assessment rate would range  depending on the risk category of the institution  from to basis points 
the fdic would then adjust the initial base assessment higher or lower to obtain the total base assessment rate 
the adjustment to the initial base assessment rate would be based upon an institution s levels of unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and brokered deposits 
the total base assessment rate would range from to basis points of the institution s deposits 
on december   the fdic published a final rule raising the current deposit insurance assessment rates uniformly for all institutions by basis points to a range from to basis points for the first quarter of however  the fdic approved an extension of the comment period on the parts of the proposed rulemaking that would become effective on april  the fdic expects to issue a second final rule early in  to be effective april   to change the way that the fdic s assessment system differentiates for risk and to set new assessment rates beginning with the second quarter of insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
we do not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
in addition to the fdic assessments  the financing corporation fico is authorized to impose and collect  with the approval of the federal deposit insurance corporation  assessments for anticipated payments  issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the fico in the s to recapitalize the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the bonds issued by the fico are due to mature in through for the quarter ended december   the annualized fico assessment was equal to basis points for each in domestic deposits maintained at an institution 
the fdic has issued an interim rule that provides for a basis point special assessment to be collected on september   based on june   call report data 
the company estimates that this special assessment will increase waterstone bank fdic premium expense by million in the third quarter of the interim rule also provides that the board might impose additional special assessments of up to basis points thereafter under certain circumstances 
the fdic has indicated that it would reduce the special assessment to basis points if congress provides the fdic higher borrowing authority 
congress is currently expected to enact legislation that would provide the fdic with the higher borrowing authority 
additional changes to the fdic assessment system effective april  include higher rates for institutions that rely significantly on secured liabilities

table of contents capitalization wisconsin law and regulation 
wisconsin savings banks are required to maintain a minimum capital to assets ratio of and must maintain total capital necessary to ensure the continuation of insurance of deposit accounts by the fdic 
if the wdfi determines that the financial condition  history  management or earning prospects of a savings bank are not adequate  the wdfi may require a higher minimum capital level for the savings bank 
if a wisconsin savings bank s capital ratio falls below the required level  the wdfi may direct the savings bank to adhere to a specific written plan established by the wdfi to correct the savings bank s capital deficiency  as well as a number of other restrictions on the savings bank s operations  including a prohibition on the declaration of dividends 
at december   waterstone bank s capital to assets ratio  as calculated under wisconsin law  was federal law and regulation 
under fdic regulations  federally insured state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system state non member banks  such as waterstone bank  are required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements 
for an institution determined by the fdic to not be anticipating or experiencing significant growth and to be  in general  a strong banking organization  rated composite under the uniform financial institutions ranking system established by the federal financial institutions examination council  the minimum capital leverage requirement is a ratio of tier i capital to total assets of 
for all other institutions  the minimum leverage capital ratio is not less than 
tier i capital is the sum of common shareholders equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock including any related surplus and minority investments in certain subsidiaries  less intangible assets except for certain servicing rights and credit card relationships and certain other specified items 
the fdic regulations require state non member banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk weighted assets 
the ratio of regulatory capital to regulatory risk weighted assets is referred to as a bank s risk based capital ratio 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet items including recourse obligations  direct credit substitutes and residual interests to four risk weighted categories ranging from to  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
for example  under the fdic s risk weighting system  cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government are given a risk weight  loans secured by one to four family residential properties generally have a risk weight  and commercial loans have a risk weighting of 
state non member banks  such as waterstone bank  must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  of which at least one half must be tier i capital 
total capital consists of tier i capital plus tier or supplementary capital items  which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative preferred stock and certain other capital instruments  and a portion of the net unrealized gain on equity securities 
the includable amount of tier capital cannot exceed the amount of the institution s tier i capital 
banks that engage in specified levels of trading activities are subject to adjustments in their risk based capital calculation to ensure the maintenance of sufficient capital to support market risk 
the fdic  along with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank s capital adequacy 
the fdic also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution s capital level is  or is likely to become  inadequate in light of the particular circumstances 

table of contents safety and soundness standards each federal banking agency  including the fdic  has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director  or principal shareholder 
prompt corrective regulatory action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act requires  among other things  that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  the statute establishes five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the federal deposit insurance corporation may order savings banks which have insufficient capital to take corrective actions 
for example  a savings bank which is categorized as undercapitalized would be subject to growth limitations and would be required to submit a capital restoration plan  and a holding company that controls such a savings bank would be required to guarantee that the savings bank complies with the restoration plan 
a significantly undercapitalized savings bank would be subject to additional restrictions 
savings banks deemed by the federal deposit insurance corporation to be critically undercapitalized would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
dividends under wisconsin law and applicable regulations  a wisconsin savings bank that meets its regulatory capital requirement may declare dividends on capital stock based upon net profits  provided that its paid in surplus equals its capital stock 
if the paid in surplus of the savings bank does not equal its capital stock  the board of directors may not declare a dividend unless at least of the net profits of the preceding half year  in the case of quarterly or semi annual dividends  or of the net profits of the preceding year  in the case of annual dividends  has been transferred to paid in surplus 
in addition  prior wdfi approval is required before dividends exceeding of profits for any calendar year may be declared and before a dividend may be declared out of retained earnings 
under wdfi regulations  a wisconsin savings bank which has converted from mutual to stock form also is prohibited from paying a dividend on its capital stock if the payment causes the regulatory capital of the savings bank to fall below the amount required for its liquidation account 
the primary source of waterstone financial s cash flow  including cash flow to pay dividends on waterstone financial s common stock  is the payment of dividends to waterstone financial by waterstone bank 
the federal deposit insurance corporation has the authority to prohibit waterstone bank from paying dividends if  in its opinion  the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of waterstone bank 
in addition  since waterstone bank is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  waterstone bank must file a notice with the office of thrift supervision at least days before the board declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution

generally  such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than  those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectibility 
an exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the savings bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank

there can be no assurance when  if ever  a conversion transaction will occur  and the board of directors has no current intention or plan to undertake a conversion transaction 
in a conversion transaction a new holding company would be formed as the successor to waterstone financial the new holding company  lamplighter financial  mhc s corporate existence would end  and certain depositors of waterstone bank would receive the right to subscribe for shares of the new holding company 
in a conversion transaction  each share of common stock held by shareholders other than lamplighter financial  mhc minority shareholders would be automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock of the new holding company determined pursuant to an exchange ratio that ensures that minority shareholders own the same percentage of common stock in the new holding company as they owned in waterstone financial immediately prior to the conversion transaction subject to adjustment for any mutual holding company assets or waived dividends  as applicable 
the total number of shares of common stock held by minority shareholders after a conversion transaction also would be increased by any purchases by minority shareholders in the stock offering conducted as part of the conversion transaction 
any conversion transaction would require the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of waterstone financial held by minority shareholders and by two thirds of the total outstanding shares of common stock of waterstone financial 
any conversion transaction also would require the approval of a majority of the eligible votes of depositors of lamplighter financial  mhc

federal and state taxation federal taxation general 
waterstone financial and subsidiaries and lamplighter financial  mhc are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations  with some exceptions discussed below 
waterstone financial and subsidiaries constitute an affiliated group of corporations and  therefore  are be eligible to report their income on a consolidated basis 
because lamplighter financial  mhc owns less than of the common stock of waterstone financial  it is not a member of that affiliated group and will report its income on a separate return 
the following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to lamplighter financial  mhc  waterstone financial or waterstone bank 
method of accounting 
for federal income tax purposes  waterstone financial currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending december for filing its federal income tax returns 
bad debt reserves 
prior to the small business protection act of the act  waterstone bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve 
these additions could  within specified formula limits  be deducted in arriving at our taxable income 
as a result of the act  waterstone bank was required to use the specific charge off method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its federal tax return 
savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of december  base year reserve 
at december   waterstone bank had no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year 
taxable distributions and recapture 
prior to the act  bad debt reserves created prior to january  were subject to recapture into taxable income if waterstone bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests 
federal legislation has eliminated these thrift related recapture rules 
at december   our total federal pre base year reserve was approximately million 
however  under current law  pre base year reserves remain subject to recapture if waterstone bank makes certain non dividend distributions  repurchases any of its stock  pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits  or ceases to maintain a bank charter 
alternative minimum tax 
the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  imposes an alternative minimum tax amt at a rate of on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences which we refer to as alternative minimum taxable income 
the amt is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount and the amt exceeds the regular income tax 
net operating losses can offset no more than of alternative minimum taxable income 
amt payments may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years 
due to a federal net operating loss carry back generated in  waterstone financial became subject to amt for and at december   the company has an amt carry forward of  that is fully offset by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
net operating loss carryovers 
a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding taxable years 
at december   waterstone bank had no net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
corporate dividends received deduction 
waterstone financial may exclude from its income of dividends received from waterstone bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations 
the corporate dividends received deduction is in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return  and corporations which own less than of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only of dividends received or accrued on their behalf 

table of contents state taxation wisconsin state taxation 
lamplighter financial  mhc  waterstone financial  waterstone bank and waterstone mortgage corporation are subject to the wisconsin corporate franchise income tax 
under current law  the state of wisconsin imposes a corporate franchise tax of on the separate taxable incomes of the members of our consolidated income tax group except our nevada subsidiary 
prior to january   the income of the nevada subsidiary was only subject to taxation in nevada  which currently does not impose a corporate income or franchise tax 
in february  the wisconsin legislature passed legislation that requires combined state tax reporting effective january  this legislation will result in the income of the nevada subsidiary being subject to the wisconsin corporate franchise tax of 
the legislation precludes the company from offsetting taxable income generated by the nevada subsidiary against the taxable operating loss carryforwards generated by waterstone bank which originated prior to january  estimated nevada subsidiary taxable income is million 
the company is currently re evaluating its corporate structure 
during the first quarter of  the company settled a dispute with the state of wisconsin regarding the operations of the company s investment subsidiary located in the state of nevada 
the settlement covered the nevada operations through the march  settlement date 
the settlement had no material effect on net income for the period as the full liability of million  including interest  net of deferred federal tax benefit of million  was accrued in prior periods 
the settlement had the effect of reducing the estimated effective tax rate for the year ended december  from the year ended december  as statutory interest no longer accrues as the liability has been settled 
item a 
risk factors changing interest rates could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on our net interest income 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore our results of operation could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rate received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
although the company believes that it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operation  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
during we continued to experience deterioration in our loan portfolio resulting in high levels of delinquencies  non performing loans and charge offs 
during  we continued to experience elevated levels of non performing loans and loan delinquencies 
our non performing loans increased from million at december  to million at december  moreover  our loans delinquent days or more increased from million at december  to million an december  this deterioration in our loan portfolio has contributed to increased charge offs 
to the extent that our loan portfolio experiences further deterioration  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
further deterioration could also lead to mandatory or discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material impact on the company s financial statements 

table of contents if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our results of operation could be negatively impacted 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we analyze our loss and delinquency experience by loan categories and we consider the impact of existing economic conditions 
if the results of our analyses are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance which would decrease our net income 
although we are unaware of any specific problems with our loan portfolio that would require any increase in our allowance at the present time  it may need to be increased further in the future due to credit deterioration  our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of commercial real estate loans 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs  although we are unaware of any reason for them to do so at the present time 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
continued deterioration of our investment portfolio could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
during  deterioration in the general economic environment resulted in a decline in the value of our overall investment portfolio 
a significant portion of this decline in value related to our mortgage related securities portfolio 
the decline in value of the mortgage related securities resulted primarily from a deterioration in the performance of the underlying mortgages that provide the principal and interest cash flow for the securities 
in the instance of one mortgage related security  this deterioration reached a level that resulted in the company s determination that the security was other than temporarily impaired 
as such  the million difference between fair value and book value was recognized as an impairment loss during the year ended december  continued deterioration of general economic market conditions could result in future impairment losses on this security or other investment securities 
if our investment in the federal home loan bank of chicago is classified as other than temporarily impaired  our earnings and stockholders equity could decrease we own common stock of the federal home loan bank of chicago fhlbc 
we hold the fhlbc common stock to qualify for membership in the federal home loan bank system and to be eligible to borrow funds under the fhlbc s advance program 
the fair value of our fhlbc common stock as of december  was million based on its cost 
there is no market for our fhlbc common stock 
recent published reports indicate that certain member banks of the federal home loan bank system may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels 
in an extreme situation  it is possible that the capitalization of a federal home loan bank  including the fhlbc  could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero 
consequently  we believe that there is a risk that our investment in fhlbc common stock could be deemed other than temporarily impaired at some time in the future  and if this occurs  it would cause our earnings and stockholders equity to decrease by the after tax amount of any impairment charge

our non interest expense will increase as a result of increases in fdic insurance premiums the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic imposes an assessment against institutions for deposit insurance 
this assessment is based on the risk category of the institution and currently ranges from to basis points of the institution s deposits 
federal law requires that the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund be established by the fdic at to of estimated insured deposits 
if this reserve ratio drops below or the fdic expects that it will do so within six months  the fdic must  within days  establish and implement a plan to restore the designated reserve ratio to of estimated insured deposits within five years absent extraordinary circumstances 
recent bank failures coupled with deteriorating economic conditions have significantly reduced the deposit insurance fund s reserve ratio 
as of june   the designated reserve ratio was of estimated insured deposits at march  as a result of this reduced reserve ratio  on october   the fdic published a proposed rule that would restore the reserve ratios to its required level 
the proposed rule would raise the current deposit insurance assessment rates uniformly for all institutions by basis points to a range from to basis points for the first quarter of the proposed rule would also alter the way the fdic calculates federal deposit insurance assessment rates beginning in the second quarter of and thereafter 
under the proposed rule  the fdic would first establish an institution s initial base assessment rate 
this initial base assessment rate would range  depending on the risk category of the institution  from to basis points 
the fdic would then adjust the initial base assessment higher or lower to obtain the total base assessment rate 
the adjustments to the initial base assessment rate would be based upon an institution s levels of unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and brokered deposits 
the total base assessment rate would range from to basis points of the institution s deposits 
there can be no assurance that the proposed rule will be implemented by the fdic or implemented in its proposed form 
in addition  the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa temporarily increased the limit on fdic insurance coverage for deposits to  through december   and the fdic took action to provide coverage for newly issued senior unsecured debt and non interest bearing transaction accounts in excess of the  limit  for which institutions will be assessed additional premiums 
the fdic has issued an interim rule that provides for a basis point special assessment to be collected on september   based on june   call report data 
the company estimates that this special assessment will increase waterstone bank fdic premium expense by million in the third quarter of the interim rule also provides that the board might impose additional special assessments of up to basis points thereafter under certain circumstances 
the fdic has indicated that it would reduce the special assessment to basis points if congress provides the fdic with higher borrowing authority 
congress is currently expected to enact legislation that would provide the fdic with the higher borrowing authority 
additional changes to the fdic assessment system effective april  include higher rates for institutions that rely significantly on secured liabilities 
the estimated effect of these changes will add an additional basis points  or  to waterstone bank fdic premiums on an annual basis 
these actions will significantly increase our non interest expense in and in future years as long as the increased premiums are in place

as of february   there were  of common stock outstanding and  shareholders of record of the common stock 
waterstone financial  inc became a publicly held corporation on october  waterstone financial has never paid a cash dividends on its common stock 
our board has not currently considered a policy of paying cash dividends on the common stock 
if the board considers a cash dividend in the future  which cannot be assured  the payment of dividends will depend upon a number of factors  including capital requirements  waterstone financial s and waterstone bank s financial condition and results of operations  tax considerations  statutory and regulatory limitations and general economic conditions and regulatory restrictions that affect the payment of dividends by waterstone bank to waterstone financial 
no assurances can be given that any dividends will be paid or that  if paid  they will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 
special cash dividends  stock dividends or returns of capital  to the extent permitted by applicable policy and regulation  may be paid in addition to  or in lieu of  regular cash dividends 
accordingly  it is anticipated that any cash distributions made by waterstone financial to its shareholders would be treated as cash dividends and not as a non taxable return of capital for federal and state tax purposes 
dividends from waterstone financial will depend  in part  upon receipt of dividends from waterstone bank  because waterstone financial initially will have no source of income other than dividends from waterstone bank  earnings from the investment of proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock  and interest payments with respect to waterstone financial s loan to the employee stock ownership plan 
wisconsin law generally will allow waterstone bank to pay dividends to waterstone financial equal to up to of waterstone bank s net profit in the current year without prior regulatory approval and above such amount  including out of retained earnings  with prior regulatory approval

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on october   waterstone bank completed its reorganization and initial public offering of common stock of waterstone financial  inc upon completion of the reorganization  lamplighter financial  mhc a wisconsin chartered mutual holding company owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of waterstone financial  inc and waterstone financial  inc owned of the common stock of the bank 
as of december   lamplighter financial  mhc owned approximately of the company 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of residential loans  construction loans and debt and mortgage related securities and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of time deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of chicago 
waterstone bank is a mortgage lender with mortgage loans comprising of total loans receivable on december  further  of loans receivable at december  are residential mortgage loans of which are one to four family loans and are over four family residential mortgage loans 
waterstone bank funds loan production primarily with retail deposits 
total deposits were of total assets on december  in addition  of total deposits were time deposits also known as certificates of deposit 
deposits obtained from brokers totaled million at december  waterstone bank uses borrowings from the federal home loan bank of chicago as a secondary source of funding 
federal home loan bank advances outstanding on december  totaled million or of total assets 
our results of operations also are significantly affected by our provision for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
during the past two years our provision for loan losses has been the most significant driver of our result of operations 
non interest income currently consists primarily of service fees  income from the increase on the cash surrender value of life insurance and miscellaneous other income 
non interest expense currently consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  data processing  advertising and marketing and other operating expenses including consulting and other professional fees 
our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
allowance for loan losses 
waterstone bank establishes valuation allowances on loans deemed to be impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that waterstone bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the present value of the expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral 

table of contents waterstone bank also establishes valuation allowances based on an evaluation of the various risk components that are inherent in the credit portfolio 
the risk components that are evaluated include past loan loss experience  the level of non performing and classified assets  current economic conditions  volume  growth  and composition of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  regulatory guidance  and other relevant factors 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and recoveries of previously charged off loans and reduced by charge offs 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved quarterly by the waterstone bank board of directors 
the allowance reflects management s best estimate of the amount needed to provide for the probable loss on impaired loans and other inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and is based on a risk model developed and implemented by management and approved by the waterstone bank board of directors 
actual results could differ from this estimate  and future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions 
in addition  state and federal regulators periodically review the waterstone bank allowance for loan losses 
such regulators have the authority to require waterstone bank to recognize additions to the allowance at the time of their examination 
if the allowance for loan losses is too low we may incur higher provisions for loan losses in the future resulting in lower net income or a net loss 
if an estimate of the allowance for loan losses is too high  we may experience lower provisions for loan losses resulting in higher net income 
income taxes 
the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements  rather than amounts reported on the income tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
during  the company recorded net income tax expense of million which included million of additional income tax expense to establish a valuation allowance against the company s net deferred tax asset 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods  while negative evidence includes the cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at december   the company determined a valuation allowance was necessary  largely based on the negative evidence represented by a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused by the significant loan loss provisions recorded during in addition  general uncertainty surrounding future economic and business conditions have increased the potential volatility and uncertainty of projected earnings 
management is required to re evaluate the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance quarterly 

positions taken in the company s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination 
the benefit of uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the income statement 
during the first quarter of  the company settled a dispute with the state of wisconsin regarding the operations of the company s investment subsidiary located in the state of nevada 
the settlement covered the nevada operations through the march  settlement date 
the settlement had no material effect on net income for the period as the full liability of million  including interest  net of deferred federal tax benefit of million  was accrued in prior periods 
the settlement had the effect of reducing the estimated effective tax rate for the year ended december  from the year ended december  as statutory interest no longer accrues as the liability has been settled 

table of contents management believes its tax policies and practices are critical because the determination of the tax provision and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities have a material impact on our net income and the carrying value of our assets 
we have no plans to change the tax recognition methodology in the future 
if our estimated valuation allowance is adjusted it will affect our future net income 
as of december   there was a valuation allowance of million 
the net recorded deferred tax asset  after valuation allowance  at december  was million 
the remaining deferred tax asset was supported by remaining carry backs of income taxes paid in prior years and available tax planning strategies 
the deferred tax asset is also net of deferred tax liabilities associated with net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of december  and  there was a valuation allowance of  and  respectively  related to the state deferred tax asset recognized for the wisconsin charitable contribution deduction carry forward 
comparison of financial condition at december  and at december total assets total assets increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in total assets is reflected in increases in loans receivable of million  cash and cash equivalents of million  securities available for sale and held to maturity of million and an increase in real estate owned of million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses of million and a decrease in loans held for sale of million 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december  from million at december  securities available for sale securities available for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the company invested an additional million in its nevada investment subsidiary during the year ended december  the investment subsidiary used the proceeds of the capital infusion to purchase additional mortgage related securities 
in addition  the company purchased a million trust preferred security during the current year 
this increase was partially offset by an impairment loss recognized during the third quarter 
during the third quarter  the company held one available for sale security with a book value that exceeded market value that was determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
the security is a collateralized mortgage obligation that had a book value of million and an estimated fair market value of million based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
as a result of the company s analysis  a million impairment loss was recognized during the third quarter of with respect to this security 
securities held to maturity securities held to maturity increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  these higher yielding structured corporate notes accrue interest based on the range of a constant maturity treasury yield spread and therefore have a higher potential for market value volatility 
as the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity  they have been classified as held to maturity rather than as available for sale 
the securities have a total estimated fair value of million as of december  loans held for sale loans held for sale decreased by million  or  to million at december   from million at december  fluctuations in the balance of loans held for sale result primarily from the timing of loan closings and sales to third parties 
loans receivable loans receivable increased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the total increase in loans receivable was primarily attributable to a million increase in one to four family loans  a million increase in over four family loans and a million increase in commercial business loans 
during the year ended december   million in loans were transferred to real estate owned 

table of contents federal home loan bank stock 
federal home loan bank chicago fhlbc stock increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase is the result of the increase in federal home loan bank advances outstanding at december  as compared to december  minimum stock ownership is based on a combination of member bank mortgage loans and federal home loan bank advances outstanding 
waterstone bank owns the minimum required amount of federal home loan bank stock based on the highest level of advances outstanding during the federal home loan bank has not paid a dividend since the second quarter of on october   the fhlbc entered into a consensual cease and desist order with its regulator  the federal housing finance board 
under the terms of the order  capital stock repurchases and redemptions  including redemptions upon membership withdrawal or other termination  are prohibited unless the fhlbc has received approval of the director of the office of supervision of the federal housing finance board os director 
the order also provides that dividend declarations are subject to the prior written approval of the os director 
cash surrender value of life insurance cash surrender value of life insurance increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  a new million bank owned life insurance contract was entered into during the year 
real estate owned 
total real estate owned increased by million to million as of december   compared to million as of december  this increase is the direct result of the continued deterioration of the local real estate market 
deposits 
total deposits increased million  or  to billion at december  from million at december  total time deposits increased million  or  to billion from million at december  the increase in time deposits resulted from a promotion for time deposits in both the local retail and non local wholesale markets 
time deposits originated through local retail outlets increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  time deposits originated through the wholesale market increased million  to million at december  from million at december  total money market and savings deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  total demand deposits increased  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in deposits was used to fund loan growth throughout the year 
borrowings 
total borrowings increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the overall increase in borrowings at december  was a result of an increase of million in fhlbc advances  partially offset by a decrease of million in federal funds borrowed 
borrowings are generally used for funding purposes when rates and terms are favorable as compared to alternate funding sources including retail and wholesale time deposits 
other liabilities 
other liabilities decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted from a million decrease in outstanding escrow checks  and a million decrease in accrued income taxes 
the company receives payments from borrowers for their real estate taxes during the course of the calendar year until real estate tax obligations are paid out at the end of the fourth quarter 
these amounts remain classified as other liabilities until paid 
shareholders equity 
shareholders equity decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily a result of net loss of million recognized during the year ended december  in addition  accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of taxes increased by million 
accumulated other comprehensive loss is the estimated unrealized loss attributable to the decline in market value of available for sale investment securities 
volatility in both the mortgage related securities market and the municipal bond market has resulted in large declines in the estimated market value of these securities 
these decreases in shareholders equity were partially offset by a combined increase in additional paid in capital and unearned esop shares of million due to the net impact of employee benefits including esop  incentive stock options and restricted stock awards

comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net loss for the year ended december  totaled million  or for both basic and diluted earnings per share compared to net income of million  or for both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the year ended december  generated an annualized loss on average assets of and an annualized loss on average equity of  compared to annualized return of and  respectively  for the year ended december  the net loss was primarily due to a million increase in our provision for loan losses 
throughout the year  the company received updated appraisals on properties that collateralize non performing loans 
the decline in value noted in the appraisals  in addition to the continued downturn in the real estate market prompted the company to reevaluate the assumptions used to determine the fair value of collateral related to additional non performing loans 
due to continued deterioration in the loan portfolio and underlying collateral  the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the year ended december  the increase in the provision for loan losses was compounded by a  decrease in noninterest income  a million increase in noninterest expense and million increase in income tax expense  partially offset by a million increase in net interest income 
the reason as to why the company had income tax expense for the year ended december  rather than an income tax benefit is discussed below 
loan charge off activity and specific loan reserves are discussed in additional detail in the asset quality section beginning on page the net interest margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  
table of contents during  the company recorded deferred income tax expense of million related to net deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods  while negative evidence includes the cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at december   the company determined a valuation allowance was necessary  largely based on the negative evidence represented by a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused by the significant loan loss provisions recorded during in addition  general uncertainty surrounding future economic and business conditions have increased the potential volatility and uncertainty of projected earnings 
management is required to re evaluate the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance quarterly 
the benefit may still be realized in the future  depending on a number of factors including future taxable income 
total interest income 
total interest income increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest income on loans increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period of the increase resulted primarily from an increase of million  or  in the average loan balance to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the increase in average balance was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  in addition  interest income from mortgage related securities increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to an increase of million  or  in the average balance to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in average balance was compounded by a basis point increase in the average yield on mortgage related securities to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  finally  interest income from debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this was due to a basis point decrease in the average yield on other earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   partially offset by an increase of million  or  in the average balance of other earning assets to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in average yield on other earning assets resulted primarily from a drop in the federal funds rate of basis points between december  and december  and from a decline in dividends declared on the company s fhlbc stock

income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a benefit as compared to expense for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was comprised of a federal effective rate of and a state effective benefit rate of 
the federal rate was low due to the relatively low level of consolidated pretax income as a result of high loan loss provisions

our liquidity ratio averaged and for the years ended december  and the liquidity ratio is equal to average daily cash and cash equivalents for the period divided by average total assets 
we adjust our liquidity levels to fund loan commitments  repay our borrowings  fund deposit outflows and pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives 
the operational adequacy of our liquidity position at any point in time is dependent upon the judgment of the chief financial officer as supported by the full asset liability committee 
liquidity is monitored on a daily  weekly and monthly basis using a variety of measurement tools and indicators 
regulatory liquidity  as required by the wisconsin department of financial institutions  is based on current liquid assets as a percentage of the prior month s average deposits and short term borrowings 
minimum primary liquidity is equal to of deposits and short term borrowings and minimum total regulatory liquidity is equal to of deposits and short term borrowings 
the bank s primary and total regulatory liquidity at december  was and  respectively 
our primary sources of liquidity are deposits  amortization and prepayment of loans  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and rates offered by our competition 
we set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
additional sources of liquidity used for the purpose of managing long and short term cash flows include million in federal funds lines of credit with four commercial banks and advances from the federal home loan bank of chicago fhlbc 
a portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing and financing activities

liquidity management is both a daily and longer term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of chicago  which provide an additional source of funds 
at december   we had million in advances from the federal home loan bank of chicago  of which million was due within months  and an additional available borrowing limit of million based on collateral requirements of the federal home loan bank of chicago 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million and unfunded commitments under construction loans  lines of credit and standby letters of credit of million 
at december   certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled million 
based on prior experience  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us  we will have to utilize other funding sources  such as federal home loan bank of chicago advances in order to maintain our level of assets 
however  we cannot assure that such borrowings would be available on attractive terms  or at all  if and when needed 
alternatively  we would reduce our level of liquid assets  such as our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale in order to meet funding needs 
in addition  the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher or there is an increased amount of competition for deposits in our market area at the time of renewal

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  waterstone bank s board of directors has established an asset liability committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset liability committee meets at least weekly to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which are evaluated quarterly 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
we have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i emphasized variable rate loans including variable rate one to four family  and commercial real estate loans as well as three to five year commercial real estate balloon loans  ii reducing and shortening the expected average life of the investment portfolio  and iii whenever possible  lengthening the term structure of our deposit base and our borrowings from the federal home loan bank of chicago 
these measures should serve to reduce the volatility of our net interest income in different interest rate environments

simulation analysis is an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
at least quarterly we review the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment or repricing of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities 
our most recent simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments 
prepayment rate assumptions can have a significant impact on interest income simulation results 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates may have a significant impact on the actual prepayment speeds of our mortgage related assets that may in turn affect our interest rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayment speeds slow and the average expected lives of our assets would tend to lengthen more than the expected average lives of our liabilities and therefore would most likely have a negative impact on net interest income and earnings 
percentage increase decrease in estimated net annual interest income over months basis point increase in rates basis point increase in rates basis point increase in rates basis point decrease in rates basis point decrease in rates basis point decrease in rates waterstone bank s asset liability policy limits projected changes in net average annual interest income to a maximum variance of to for various levels of interest rate changes measured over a month period when compared to the flat rate scenario 
in addition  projected changes in the capital ratio are limited to 
to for various levels of changes in interest rates when compared to the flat rate scenario 
these limits are re evaluated on a periodic basis and may be modified  as appropriate 
because our balance sheet is moderately asset sensitive  income is projected to increase as interest rates rise 
at december   a basis point immediate and instantaneous increase in interest rates had the effect of increasing forecast net interest income by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of reducing net interest income by 
at december   a basis point immediate and instantaneous increase in interest rates had the effect of increasing the forecast return on assets by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of reducing the return on assets by 
while we believe the assumptions used are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity
