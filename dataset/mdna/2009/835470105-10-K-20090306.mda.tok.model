references to we  our  and us refer to sonicwall  inc and its subsidiaries 
overview sonicwall provides network security  content security  and business continuity solutions for businesses of all sizes 
our solutions are typically deployed at the edges of networks 
these networks are often aggregated into broader distributed deployments to support companies that do business in multiple physical locations  interconnect their networks with trading partners  or support a mobile or remote workforce 
our solutions are sold in over countries worldwide 
the company groups revenue into the following primary product categories of similar products unified threat management utm including network security appliance nsa  pro  and tz products  subscription services such as comprehensive gateway security suite cgss  integrated gateway anti virus  and intrusion prevention  software licenses such as our enhanced sonicos operating system  node upgrades  and other services such 
table of contents as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
ssl vpn secure remote access ssl including ssl vpn appliances  add on software licenses and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
secure content management scm including csm and email security appliances  subscription services such as internet filtering and email protection term and perpetual licenses  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
continuous data protection cdp including the cdp appliances  off site data backup subscription services  site to site back up licenses  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
we generate revenue within these product categories primarily from the sale of products  software licenses  subscriptions for services such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention  offsite data backup  email protection  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
we currently outsource our hardware manufacturing and assembly to third party contract manufacturers and some of the key components in the company s products come from single or limited number of suppliers 
outsourcing our manufacturing and assembly enables us to reduce fixed overhead and personnel costs and to provide flexibility in meeting market demand 
we design and develop the key components for the majority of our products 
in addition  we generally determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of these components 
product testing and burn in are performed by our contract manufacturers using tests that we typically specify 
we sell our solutions primarily through distributors and value added resellers  who in turn sell our products to end users 
some of our resellers are carriers or service providers who provide solutions to the end user customers as managed services 
channel sales accounted for approximately   and of total revenue in   and  respectively 
alternative technology  tech data  and ingram micro  all of whom are technology product distributors  collectively accounted for approximately   and of our revenue during   and  respectively 
we seek to provide our channel partners and customers with differentiated solutions that are innovative  easy to use  reliable  and provide good value 
to support this commitment  we dedicate significant resources to develop new products and market our products to our channel partners and customers 
key success factors of our business we believe that there are several key success factors of our business  and that we create value in our business by focusing on our execution in these areas 
channel our distributors and authorized resellers provide a valuable service in assisting end users in the design  implementation  and service of our network security  content security  and business continuity solutions 
we support our distribution and channel partners with sales  marketing  and technical support to help them create and fulfill demand for our offerings 
we also focus on helping our channel partners succeed with our solutions by concentrating on comprehensive reseller training and certification  and support for our channel s sales activities 
product and service platform our products serve as a platform for revenue generation for both us and our channel partners 
most product sales can result in additional revenue through the simultaneous or subsequent acquisition of software licenses  such as our global management system  or through the sale of additional value added subscription services  such as content filtering  client anti virus and 
table of contents integrated gateway anti virus  anti spyware and intrusion prevention services  email protection and off site data backup 
distributed architecture our security solutions are based on a distributed architecture  which we believe allows our offerings to be deployed and managed at the most efficient location in the network 
we are providing our customers and their service providers with mechanisms to enforce the networking and security policies they have defined for their business 
we also use the flexibility of a distributed architecture to allow us to enable new functionality in already deployed platforms through the provisioning of an electronic key  which may be distributed through the internet 
market acceptance we began offering integrated security appliances in  and since that time we have shipped over million revenue units 
when measured by units shipped  we are typically among the top three suppliers in the markets in which we compete 
our experience in serving a broad market and our installed base of customers provides us with opportunities to sell our new network security  content security  and business continuity solutions as they become available 
the market acceptance of our current solutions provides our current and prospective channel partners with an increased level of comfort when deciding to offer our new solutions to their customers 
integrated design our platforms utilize a highly integrated design in order to improve ease of use  lower acquisition and operational costs for our customers  and enhance performance 
various models also integrate functionality to support different internet connection alternatives 
every appliance also ships with pre loaded firmware to provide for rapid set up and easy installation 
each of these tasks can be managed through a simple web browser session 
our opportunities  challenges  and risks we serve substantial markets for network security  content security  and business continuity 
our goal is to deliver comprehensive and profitable solutions to our channel partners which address their customers needs 
we pursue the creation of these solutions through a blend of organic and inorganic growth strategies including internal development efforts  licensing and oem opportunities  and acquisition of other companies 
to the extent that these efforts result in solutions which fit well with our channel and end users  we would expect to generate increasing sales 
to the extent that these efforts are not successful  we would expect to see loss of sales and or increased expenses without commensurate return 
international growth we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in the foreseeable future 
our percentage of sales from international territories does not represent the same degree of penetration of those markets as we have achieved domestically 
we believe that a significant opportunity exists to grow our revenue by increasing our international penetration rate to match our penetration rate in the domestic market 
if we fail to structure our distribution relationships in a manner consistent with marketplace requirements and on favorable terms  the percentage of sales from international territories will decline and the revenue from our international operations may decrease 
growth in enterprises we believe that sales through our indirect channel to larger end customers represent a growth opportunity for the company 
our percentage of revenues from such customers does not represent the same degree of penetration of that segment as we have achieved with small to medium sized businesses 
we believe that a significant opportunity exists to grow our revenue by increasing our penetration rate with this segment by leveraging the company s technological and channel strengths 
if we fail to establish competitive products and services for this segment  or fail to develop the correct channel partners and resources  the percentage of our revenue derived from larger end customers will not increase  and may  in fact  decrease 

table of contents license and services revenue we believe that the software license and services component of our revenue has several characteristics that are positive for our business as a whole our license and services revenue is associated with a higher gross profit than our product revenue  the subscription services component of license and services revenue is recognized ratably over the services period  and thus provides  in the aggregate  a more predictable revenue stream than product or license revenue  which are generally recognized at the time of the sale  and to the extent that we are able to achieve good renewal rates  we have the opportunity to lower our selling and marketing expenses attributable to that segment 
we have been successfully increasing the rate at which we have been able to sell our services to both our installed base and in conjunction with our new solution sales 
as a result  we have been able to generate incremental revenue out of each product transaction 
we expect the percentage of our total revenue from software licenses and services to continue to grow 
however  should we not achieve reasonable rates of selling our products and services to our installed base or as part of new solution sales  or realize lower subscription service renewal rates  we risk having our revenue concentrated in more unpredictable product and license sales 
macro economic factors affecting it spending we believe that our products and services are subject to the macro economic factors that affect much of the information technology it market 
growing it budgets and an increased funding for projects to provide security  mobility  data protection  and productivity could drive product upgrade cycles and or create demand for new applications of our solutions 
contractions in it spending can affect our revenue by causing projects incorporating our products and services to be delayed and or canceled 
we believe that demand for our solutions correlate with increases or decreases in global it spending and we believe that current economic uncertainties  including fluctuating energy prices  difficulties in the financial sector  the availability of credit  softness in the housing market  underlying market liquidity  and geopolitical uncertainties may continue to have an adverse impact on it spending in the markets in which we do business 
critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that the judgments  assumptions and estimates upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these judgments  assumptions and estimates are made 
however  any differences between these judgments  assumptions and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial condition 
the current volatility in the financial markets and associated general economic uncertainty increase the risk that such differences may be realized 
the accounting policies that reflect our most significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and which we believe are critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty reserve  valuation of inventory  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  share based compensation  and fair value of investments 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of products  software licenses  subscriptions for services  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
the company may experience material differences in the amount and timing of its revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
the company recognizes product and service revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and all related amendments and interpretations 
the company applies provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop no 
 and all related amendments and interpretations  to all transactions involving the sale of hardware products that include software solutions 
the company recognizes revenue for products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
while the company s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
in these cases  interpretation of non standard provisions is required to determine the appropriate accounting for the transaction 

table of contents retroactive price protection rights resulting from price reductions on products previously sold to customers are contractually offered to the company s channel partners 
the company evaluates the revenue impact of these rights carefully based on stock on hand in the channels and records a provision for estimated future price protection credit 
revenue from ingram micro and tech data is not recognized until these distributors sell the product to their customers 
as a consequence  there is no provision required for sales to these distributors 
in general  retroactive price adjustments are not significant 
at december    and  the company recorded a provision for price protection on sales to the company s channel partners in the amounts of   and  respectively 
delivery to customers is generally deemed to occur when we deliver the product to a common carrier 
certain distributor agreements provide customers with rights of return for stock rotation 
these stock rotation rights are generally limited to to of the distributor s purchases for the immediately prior to months period or contain other measurable restrictions  and we estimate reserves for these return rights as discussed below 
two of our largest distributors  ingram micro and tech data  have rights of return under certain circumstances that are not limited  therefore  we do not deem delivery to have occurred for any sales to ingram micro and tech data until they sell the product to their customers 
evidence of an arrangement is manifested by a master distribution or oem original equipment manufacturer agreement  an individual binding purchase order  or a signed license agreement 
in most cases  sales through our distributors and oem partners are governed by a master agreement against which individual binding purchase orders are placed on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable  and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the binding purchase order  including the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond the company s normal payment terms  typically to days from invoice date  the company accounts for the fee as not being fixed or determinable and recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from its customers 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  it defers the fee and recognizes revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  the sale of an appliance which includes a year of maintenance or a subscription based product  the company allocates revenue first to undelivered components of the arrangement based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  which is generally the average selling price of each element when sold separately 
this allocation process means that the company defers revenue from the arrangement equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognizes such amounts as revenue when the elements are delivered 
the company s arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  recognition of revenue occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
the company recognizes revenue for subscriptions and services such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention  and extended warranty and service contracts  ratably over the contract term 
the company s training  consulting and engineering services are generally billed and recognized as revenue as these services are performed 
the company collects and remits sales taxes on products and services that it purchases and sells under its contracts with customers  and reports such amounts under the net method in its consolidated statements of operations 
accordingly  there are no sales taxes included in revenue 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  and warranty reserve the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential future product returns and price changes related to current 
table of contents period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
in addition  we must make estimates based upon a combination of factors to ensure that our accounts receivable balances are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions including liquidity and the availability of credit facilities  deterioration in customer s operating results or financial position  customer concentrations  and customer credit worthiness  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our appliance products are generally covered by a warranty period of one or two years 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services  including the cost of technical support  product repairs  and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired 
our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of inventory we continually assess the valuation of our inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are difficult to make since they are based  in part  on estimates of current and future economic conditions 
reviews for excess inventory are done on a quarterly basis and required reserve levels are calculated with reference to our projected ultimate usage of that inventory 
in order to determine the ultimate usage  we take into account forecasted demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycles  projected obsolescence  current inventory levels  and purchase commitments 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand  and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative effect on our gross profit and earnings 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill purchased intangibles consist of purchased technology  customer installed base relationships  customer backlog and other intangibles 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from months to eight years 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired by the company 
goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred 
an impairment charge is recognized if a reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step approach in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets using one or more of the following fair value measures including present value techniques of estimated future cash flows  or valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue  or a similar performance measure 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
based on the impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in   and the goodwill recorded as a result of the business combinations in the years presented is not deductible for tax purposes 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we record an impairment charge based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
share based compensation on january   the company adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december    and reflect the impact of sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and are based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
share based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  the company continued to use the straight line single option method 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
fair value of investments fair value 
table of contents our investments consist of us treasury and us government agency securities  auction rate securities ars  asset backed securities abs  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective 
the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined  and the rapid changes occurring in today s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in the relatively short periods of time 
financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note investments and fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level instruments generally represent quoted prices in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
all of the securities classified as level instruments are ars and abs 
in february  auctions began to fail for the auction rate securities ars 
since auctions for ars continue to fail  the investments are not currently liquid 
all ars are currently rated aaa  the highest rating by a rating agency  and the underlying collateral of the ars consists of student loan obligations  which are primarily supported by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program ffelp 
the company does not expect the need to access these funds in the short term  however  in the event the company needed to access these funds  they are not expected to be accessible until one of the following occurs a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the issue  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities mature 
based on these factors  along with the underlying maturities of the securities  a portion of which is greater than years  the company has classified auction rate securities as long term assets on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  the ars were classified as short term investments as of december  the failures of these auctions do not affect the value of the collateral underlying the ars  and the company continues to earn and receive interest on its ars based on a pre determined formula 
notwithstanding the foregoing  in november  the company accepted an offer the right from ubs  one of its investment providers  entitling the company to sell to ubs at par value ars originally purchased from ubs approximately million  par value at anytime during the period commencing june  through july  in accepting the right  the company also granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par at any time after accepting the offer until the expiration date of the offer provided that the company receive par value of their ars 
as part of the offer  the company released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of ars 
although the company expects to sell its ars under the right  if the right is not exercised before july   the right will expire and ubs will have no further right or obligation to buy the company s ars 
ubs s obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
the right represents a firm agreement in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  which defines a firm agreement with an unrelated party  binding on both parties and usually legally enforceable  with the following characteristics a the agreement specifies all significant terms  including the quantity to be exchanged  the fixed price  and the timing of the transaction  and b the agreement includes a disincentive for nonperformance that is sufficiently large to make performance probable 
the enforceability of the right results in a put option and should be recognized as a separate freestanding asset and is accounted for separately from the ars investment 
as of december   the company recorded million as the fair value of the put option asset  classified as long term investment on the balance sheet as of december   with a corresponding credit to interest and other income  net  in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  the put option does not meet the definition of a 
table of contents derivative instrument under sfas therefore  the company elected to measure the put option at fair value under sfas  which permits an entity to elect the fair value option for recognized financial assets  in order to match the changes in the fair value of the ars 
on date available as of december   the company valued the right using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flow  adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  these assumptions are volatile and subject to change if the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
prior to accepting the ubs offer  the company recorded its ars as available for sale investments 
in connection with the acceptance of the ubs offer in november  resulting in a right to require ubs to purchase the ars at par value beginning on june   the company has reclassified the related portion of its ars subject to the right and held by ubs from available for sale to trading in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
the transfer to trading securities reflects management s intent to exercise its put option during the period june  to july  prior to its agreement with ubs  management s intent was to hold the ars until the earlier of anticipated recovery in market value or maturity 
upon the reclassification of the related ars to trading securities  the company immediately recognized a loss of million  included in interest and other income  net  for the amount of the unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings 
the company holds additional ars with another investment advisor who has not made an offer similar to ubs 
these ars will continue to be held as available for sale 
the company intends to retain its investment in the ars until the earlier of anticipated recovery in market value or maturity and as a result has not recorded an other than temporary loss on these ars 
as of december   the underlying assets of the asset backed securities abs are all prime mortgages 
none of the underlying assets of these abs are subprime mortgages or have a collateralized debt obligation exposure 
the company has million in abs backed by the us government 
these securities could be generally liquidated within a timeframe of three to nine months and were included in short term investments on the consolidated balance sheet 
for the remaining million in non government backed abs  the market continues to be illiquid 
as a result  the company has classified these as long term 
the company has both the intent and the ability to hold these investments until a recovery of the fair value occurs  which may be at maturity  evidenced by its cash and short term investment position and the ability to generate positive cash flows from its operation 
historically  the fair value of the ars and the abs investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while the company continues to earn interest on its ars and abs investments at the contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value 
at december   the company s investment advisors provided a valuation based on level inputs for the ars and the abs investments 
the investment advisors utilized a discounted cash flow approach to arrive at this valuation  which for the ars securities was corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis prepared by the company 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
the company valued the right as a put option asset using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of  based on level data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flow  adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  in addition  the company engaged an independent valuation firm to evaluate the values received from the broker dealer statement for the abs securities 
the independent valuation firm used a market approach methodology utilizing information such as trade data  two sided markets  institutional bids  comparable trades  dealer quotes  and data from news media 
the company reviewed the methodology used and the resulting valuation confirms the quotes received from the investment advisor 
the assumptions used in valuing the ars  the abs  and the put option are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
other than temporary impairment 
all of the company s available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
the company recognizes an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of its investments below the cost basis is judged to be other than temporary

table of contents our methodology for allocating the purchase price for purchase acquisitions to in process research and development ipr d is determined through established valuation techniques and analysis  as applied in the high technology internet security industry 
the ipr d expense in  which is related to the acquisition of aventail  was primarily for the development of aventail s next generation product 
this ipr d was expensed upon the acquisition of aventail because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
total ipr d expense of million was charged to product development expenses on the date the assets were acquired 
the ipr d expense in  which was related to the mailfrontier acquisition  was primarily for the development of mailfrontier s version this ipr d was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
total ipr d expense of million was charged to product development expenses on the date the assets were acquired 
the fair value of the existing purchased technology  as well as the technology under development  is determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rate used in the present value calculation was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
we consider this pricing model for acquired products and technology to be standard within the high technology internet security industry 
we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings 
the key assumptions underlying the valuation of our aventail purchase acquisition for which in process research and development was recorded were as follows estimated cost to complete technology at time of acquisition was approximately million  and risk adjusted discount rate of 
other key assumptions include an expected completion date of approximately one year and revenue and expense projections  assuming that the product has entered the market 
the key assumptions underlying the valuation of our mailfrontier purchase acquisition for which in process research and development was recorded were as follows estimated cost to complete technology at time of acquisition of less than  and risk adjusted discount rate of

interest income and other expense  net interest income and other expense net were million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  and primarily consists of interest income on our cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the fluctuations in the short term interest rates directly influence the interest income we recognize 
the decrease in as compared to was caused by a combination of a significantly lower overall balance in our investment portfolio due to our share repurchase program and lower investment yields 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to higher effective interest rates earned in our investment portfolio

table of contents our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal and state tax rates for the fiscal year ended december  primarily due to non deductible share based compensation expense and state income taxes which were offset by state research and development tax credits 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal and state tax rates for the fiscal year ended december  primarily due to the tax benefit from the partial release of the valuation allowance  the effect of share based compensation related to incentive stock options  goodwill and intangible assets  which are permanent  non deductible book tax differences  and the utilization of the deferred tax assets derived from previously acquired companies 
the cumulative effect of the acquired company deferred tax assets resulted in a reduction in goodwill 
in  we released a substantial portion of our valuation allowance considering all available evidence 
the available positive evidence at december   included three years of cumulative historical operating profits  a projection of future income sufficient to realize most of the remaining deferred tax assets  and other evidence 
the company recorded a partial valuation allowance release of million in fiscal year  because as of december   it was considered more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain acquired net operating losses due to the annual change in ownership limitation by the internal revenue code of  as amended

liquidity and capital resource requirements we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the next twelve months 
however  we could elect to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales  marketing  and support operations  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  market acceptance of our products  and pursuit of corporate opportunities 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our sources of liquidity beyond twelve months  in management s opinion  will be our then current cash balances  funds from operations and whatever long term credit facilities we can arrange 
we have no agreements or arrangements with third parties to provide us with sources of liquidity and capital resources beyond twelve months 
we believe that future liquidity and capital resources will not be materially affected in the event we are not able to prevail in litigation for which we have been named a defendant as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

recent accounting pronouncements the information contained in note to the consolidated financial statements under the heading recent accounting pronouncements is hereby incorporated by reference into this part ii  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents  and investment portfolio 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we classified our investments as available for sale except the auction rate securities in one of our investment firms 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further detailed discussion 
the available for sale investments are recorded on the balance sheet at the fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio included money markets securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  auction rate securities  asset backed securities  and commercial papers which are generally subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity  but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates change prior to maturity 
a hypothetical basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the december  balance would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately million 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as stated in our investment policy  we are adverse to principal loss and further the goal of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade instruments 
as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
principal amounts by expected year of maturity in us dollars as of december  are as follows in thousands  except percentages 
table of contents maturing in thereafter total fair value corporate debt securities weighted average interest rate us government securities weighted average interest rate asset backed securities weighted average interest rate auction rate securities weighted average interest rate total marketable securities at december   included within our investment portfolio are million of investments in auction rate securities and million of assets backed securities 
refer to note  financial instruments  in part ii item for additional information 
foreign currency risk we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in general to be moderate 
we invoice substantially all of our foreign customers from the united states in us dollars and substantially all revenue is collected in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from international markets 
we may  in the future  denominate these transactions in various local currencies 
because our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  the weakness of a foreign country s currency against the dollar could increase the price of our products in such country and reduce our product unit sales by making our products more expensive in the local currency 
a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 
as our base of international operations expands  a greater percentage of our employee base will be paid in local currency 
this expansion increases our exposure to emerging market currencies  which can have extreme currency volatility 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar and diverging economic conditions in foreign markets in which we do business 
we have minimal cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as our business model changes to include greater international participation  our exposure to foreign currency risk increases 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency transactions 
we cannot  however  assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
financial market risk included within our investment portfolio at december  were ars that we purchased for million whose underlying assets are primarily student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government and abs that were purchased for million whose underlying assets are all prime mortgages of which approximately are backed by the federal government 
the ars are currently rated aaa  the highest rating  by a rating agency 
beginning in february  auctions for certain of these securities failed due to insufficient bids from buyers 
in  we accepted an offer from one of our investment banks under which the bank would purchase over of these securities at par anytime during a two year period beginning june  in the event the liquidity of our investment bank is adversely impacted by the current uncertainties in the financial market  they may be unable to pay us when their payment option comes due 
the market for the non government backed abs securities has been illiquid in we may not be able to access these funds until our investment bank is able to pay us the offered amount  future auctions for the auction rate securities in our portfolio are successful or until we sell the securities in a secondary market which currently is very volatile and has experienced discount rates of up to for similar investments 
although there have been instances of redemptions at par by municipalities through refinance of new debt along with speculation that the federal government will provide incentive plans to spur the refinancing activities  the ars and non government backed abs investments currently lack short term liquidity and were therefore reclassified as non current on our december  balance sheet 
we will continue to evaluate any changes in the market for ars and abs 
depending upon future market conditions  we may be required to record an other than temporary decline in market value 
in such an event  the company s financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings could be negatively affected
