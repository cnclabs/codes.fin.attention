overview intevac provides manufacturing equipment and solutions to the hard disk drive industry and offers advanced etch technology systems to the semiconductor industry 
intevac s lean platform may be suitable to certain non magnetic thin film applications such as optical coatings  photovoltaic and wear resistant coatings although to date intevac has not received revenues from such applications 
intevac also provides sensitive electro optical devices used in high performance digital cameras for military and commercial applications 
intevac s customers and potential customers include manufacturers of hard disk drives  semiconductor chips and wafers  as well as medical  scientific and security companies  law enforcement and the us government and its contractors 
intevac reports two segments equipment and intevac photonics 
effective in the second quarter of  intevac renamed the imaging instrumentation segment to intevac photonics 
during the third quarter of  intevac completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of the magnetic media equipment business of oc oerlikon balzers ltd 
oerlikon 
product development and manufacturing activities occur in north america and asia 
intevac s equipment and service products are highly technical and  with the exception of japan  are sold primarily through a direct sales force 
during the third quarter of  intevac entered into an alliance with a korean equipment manufacturer and distributor  tes co  ltd 
tes 
under the agreement tes has the rights to manufacture and sell intevac s lean etch system for the korean and chinese markets  and intevac has the rights to manufacture and sell tes chemical vapor deposition equipment for customers throughout the rest of the world 
to date no sales have been made pursuant to this contract 
intevac s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for hard disk drives  which in turn depends on end user demand for personal computers  enterprise data storage  personal audio and video players and video game platforms 
intevac s business is subject to cyclical industry conditions  as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for hard disk drives  chips  and other electronic devices  as well as other factors  such as global economic conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes

fiscal financial results reflected continued good conditions in the hard disk drive industry 
revenues and net income were lower than levels and declined in the second half of during this period intevac expanded its photonics product portfolio with the acquisitions of deltanu  llc  delta nu and creative display systems  llc cds 
fiscal financial results reflected a difficult environment as intevac s customers reduced or delayed capital expenditures as a result of industry consolidation  price erosion and reduced demand as a result of global economic conditions 
in this period  intevac focused on lowering costs  improving efficiencies  and bringing new products to market 
in  intevac acquired certain assets and liabilities of oc oerlikon balzers ltd 
oerlikon s magnetic media equipment business 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in response to the deteriorating economic conditions  intevac announced and executed a global cost reduction plan that reduced its cost structure and its cash burn  while still enabling intevac to invest in products that will drive future growth 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  intevac s market capitalization and financial outlook were adversely impacted by the current macroeconomic business environment 
this triggered intevac s performing interim impairment tests on its goodwill and intangible assets  and as a result intevac recorded non cash goodwill and intangible impairment charges of million 
intevac expects the difficult environment to continue into fiscal the global economic climate and constrained financing environment have caused a broad slowdown in capital equipment purchases by our customers  with uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the downturn 
while the uncertainty of end market demand continues to dampen expectations for the hard drive market  intevac expects that in demand for some equipment will occur due to the retirement of some legacy systems 
in addition  intevac believes that research and development activities  including patterned media  will require new equipment 
intevac does not expect any of its hard drive customers to add new systems for capacity in intevac expects that in  intevac photonics business will grow  driven by government spending plus incorporation of intevac products into development  pre production and some early stage production programs 
results of operations net revenues years ended december  change change vs

in thousands  except percentages equipment intevac photonics total net revenues net revenues consist primarily of sales of equipment used to develop and manufacture thin film disks  and  to a lesser extent  related equipment and system components  flat panel equipment technology license fees  contract research and development related to the development of sensors  cameras and systems  low light imaging products and raman spectrometers 
the decrease in equipment revenues in was due primarily to a reduction in the number of lean systems delivered 
in intevac delivered eleven lean systems compared to twenty nine lean systems in and forty six lean systems in equipment revenue in also included eleven disk lubrication systems compared to four disk lubrication systems in and thirteen disk lubrication in revenues from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare part decreased significantly in versus and during  intevac sold a d star flat panel technology license for million 
fiscal was a slow year for new system capacity additions in the hard disk drive market due to the upgrade and reuse of approximately twenty legacy tools previously in storage 
this substantially met the incremental capacity requirements of one of our largest customers 
equipment revenues in are not expected to exceed levels  given the uncertainty in the market 

table of contents intevac photonics revenues increased by to million in  which consisted of million of product revenue and million of contract research and development revenue 
intevac photonics revenue of million consisted of million of product revenue and million of contract research and development revenue 
intevac photonics revenue of million consisted of million of product revenue and million of contract research and development revenue 
the increase in product revenues resulted from higher sales of low light detection sensors and cameras used in military night vision surveillance and commercial applications as well as table top and portable raman instruments and near eye display products 
the increase in contract research and development revenue was the result of a higher volume of contracts and incremental revenue generated from contract close outs 
in  intevac photonics revenue is expected to grow  due primarily to increased product sales 
during  intevac expects over of intevac s revenue to come from product sales 
substantial growth in future intevac photonics revenues is dependent on the proliferation of intevac s technology into major military programs  continued defense spending  the ability to obtain export licenses for foreign customers  obtaining production subcontracts for these programs  and development and sale of commercial products

equipment gross margin was in compared to in and in lower volume  product mix  unabsorbed factory utilization and costs from acquired businesses  which were offset in part by cost reduction programs contributed to the lower gross margin for higher gross margin in resulted from changes in product mix  higher average selling prices and cost reduction programs 
intevac expects the gross margin for the equipment business in to be essentially the same as at similar revenue levels  and lower than at reduced revenue levels 
gross margins in the equipment business will vary depending on a number of additional factors  including product mix  product cost  system configuration and pricing  factory utilization  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
intevac photonics gross margin was in compared in and in the decrease in gross margin in resulted primarily from increased provisions for inventory and warranty and increased costs from acquired businesses 
higher gross margin in resulted primarily from higher margin development contracts  favorable adjustments from contract closeouts and increased product sales 
intevac expects the gross margin for the intevac photonics business in to improve over  primarily as a result of the projected increase in product sales  which typically carry higher gross margins

all domestic sales and international sales of disk sputtering products in asia  with the exception of japan  are typically made by intevac s direct sales force  whereas sales in japan of disk sputtering products and other products are typically made by intevac s japanese distributor  matsubo  who provides services such as sales  installation  warranty and customer support 
intevac also has subsidiaries in singapore and in hong kong  along with field offices in japan  malaysia  korea and shenzhen  china to support intevac s equipment customers in asia 
selling  general and administrative costs for  and included million  million and million of equity based compensation expense  respectively 
selling  general and administrative spending in was flat to levels as a result of cost reduction activities  and lower provisions for employee profit sharing and bonus plans  partially offset by increased costs related to business development  customer service and support in both the equipment and intevac photonics businesses and higher equity based compensation expense 
intevac s selling  general and administrative headcount increased from at the end of  to at the end of and then decreased to at the end of intevac expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will decrease in over the amount spent in due primarily to a projected decrease in costs related to customer service and support for the equipment business offset by the addition of key business development personnel in the intevac photonics business 
global cost reduction plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal  intevac announced a global cost reduction plan the plan to reduce the global workforce by fifteen percent 
implementation of the plan was completed in the fourth quarter 
the total cost of implementing the plan was  and was reported under cost of products sold and operating expenses 
substantially all cash outlays in connection with the plan occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal implementation of the plan is expected to reduce expenses by approximately million on an annual basis 
impairment of goodwill and intangibles in september  intevac performed its annual assessment of impairment for goodwill which did not result in an impairment of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  intevac experienced a significant decline in its stock price and intevac s market capitalization fell below the recorded value of its consolidated net assets 
this required intevac to perform an interim test of its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
as a result of the goodwill impairment test  intevac concluded that the carrying amount of the goodwill in the equipment reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value and recorded an impairment charge of million 
the goodwill associated with the intevac photonics segment was not impaired 
as a result of the intangible assets impairment test  intevac recorded an  impairment charge related to the write down to fair value of the net carrying value of certain purchased technology intangible assets in the equipment and intevac photonics segments due to lower revenue expectations and future operating expectations 
intevac will continue to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and if it is determined that there is a potential impairment  intevac may record additional charges to earnings which would adversely affect its financial results

provision for benefit from income taxes years ended december  change change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages provision for benefit from income taxes intevac s effective income tax provision rate was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal intevac s tax rate differs from the applicable statutory rates due primarily to the utilization of deferred and current credits and the effect of permanent differences and adjustments of prior permanent differences 
intevac s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors including  the level of intevac s projected earnings  the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  net operating loss carry forwards  availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of intevac s tax planning strategies 
management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly 
management believes that the valuation allowances for intevac s deferred tax assets are adequate based on several factors including degree to which intevac s loss was attributable to unusual items or charges  long duration of intevac s deferred tax assets  and expectation of improved earnings in the long term

the fsp amends the factors that an entity should consider in determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  to include the entity s historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements  whether or not the arrangements have explicit renewal or extension provisions 
previously an entity was precluded from using its own assumptions about renewal or extension of an arrangement where there was likely to be substantial cost or modifications 
entities without their own historical experience should consider the assumptions market participants would use about renewal or extension 
the amendment may result in the useful life of an entity s intangible asset differing from the period of expected cash flows that was used to measure the fair value of the underlying asset using the market participant s perceived value

in october  the fasb issued fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active fsp  which clarifies the application of sfas when the market for a financial asset is inactive 
specifically  fsp clarifies how management s internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present  observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account  and the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value 
the guidance in fsp is effective immediately 
intevac considered the guidance provided by fsp in its determination of estimated fair values as of december   and the impact was not material 
liquidity and capital resources at december   intevac had million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments compared to million at december  during fiscal  cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased by million due primarily to cash used by operating activities  the purchase of certain assets of oerlikon  purchases of fixed assets and a scheduled payment to the owners of deltanu  llc  partially offset by cash received from the sale of intevac common stock to employees through employee benefit plans 
cash  cash equivalents and investments consist of the following december  december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments cash used by operating activities totaled million in compared to million generated by operating activities in and million generated by operating activities in lower operating cash flow was a result of a net loss adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including impairment of goodwill and intangibles  depreciation  amortization and equity based compensation 
this decrease in operating cash provided by operating activities was also affected by changes in working capital 
intevac continues to carefully manage working capital 
the number of days outstanding for intevac s accounts receivable were at december   compared to at december  and at december  intevac s inventory turns were slightly less in versus as intevac reacted responsively to the declining market conditions 
it is anticipated that market conditions may continue to weaken in the next few quarters  but intevac anticipates that its efforts to reduce costs through its global cost reduction plan and headcount restructuring activity implemented in the fourth quarter will reduce its cash loss from operations to a level sustainable until market conditions and intevac s business improves 
accounts receivable totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in the receivable balance was due primarily to having a lean system recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter 
net inventories decreased by million during due primarily to decreases in both raw materials and work in progress 
accounts payable totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease of million relates to the decrease in inventory purchases and a slowdown in intevac s business 
accrued payroll and related liabilities decreased by million during due to a decrease in accruals for bonuses and employee profit sharing 
other accrued liabilities decreased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to reductions in accruals for intevac s warranty obligations 
customer advances decreased from million at december  to million at december  due to the decrease in backlog at december  investing activities in generated cash of million as compared to cash used of million in and cash used of million in in proceeds from maturities of investments  net of purchases  totaled million

as of december   intevac s available for sale securities represented million par value of auction rate securities ars  less a temporary valuation adjustment of million to reflect their current lack of liquidity 
this adjustment was recorded in other comprehensive income and did not affect intevac s earnings in fiscal management continues to monitor the ars situation and if conditions worsen  will re evaluate the temporary nature of the valuation adjustment 
due to current market conditions  these investments have experienced failed auctions beginning in mid february these failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities  but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities 
intevac believes that given their high credit quality  it will ultimately recover at par all amounts invested in these securities 
intevac does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in these ars will affect its ability to finance its operations and planned capital expenditures 
intevac continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments 
during fiscal  a net million of ars were sold or redeemed at par 
these investments are classified as non current assets until intevac has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored 
the classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  at december   the fair value of the ars was estimated at million based on a valuation by houlihan smith company  inc  using discounted cash flow models 
the estimates of future cash flows are based on certain key assumptions  such as discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk  which are significant unobservable inputs 
as of december   there was insufficient observable market information for the ars held by intevac to determine the fair value 
therefore level fair values were estimated for these securities by incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
some of these assumptions included credit quality  collateralization  final stated maturity  estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity  redemptions of similar ars  previous market activity for the same investment security  impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models 
intevac has entered into a line of credit with citigroup global markets inc under which approximately million is available 
intevac intends to use this line to help secure its ability to fund cash requirements until intevac is able to liquidate its ars holdings 
for additional information on this borrowing facility  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
intevac believes that intevac s existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet intevac s cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
intevac intends to undertake approximately million in capital expenditures during the next months 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes intevac s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations and commitments long term debt obligations other long term liabilities total purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on intevac and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items 
amounts represent total anticipated cash payments  including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the short term portion of the obligation 
intevac is unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions  therefore   of income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above 
total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities except for the short term portion of the long term debt and other long term liabilities and certain purchase obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   intevac did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of intevac s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on intevac s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes intevac is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates intevac could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on intevac s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
intevac bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as intevac s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the 
table of contents application of those policies  management believes that intevac s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of intevac s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition intevac recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and risk of loss have passed to intevac s customer or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
intevac s shipping terms are customarily fob shipping point or equivalent terms 
intevac s revenue recognition policy generally results in revenue recognition at the following points for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment  intevac recognizes revenue upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  the portion of revenue associated with certain installation related tasks is deferred based on the estimated fair value  and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation related tasks  for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  revenue is recognized at customer acceptance  and for arrangements containing multiple elements  the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred at estimated fair value until delivery of the deferred elements 
revenue related to sales of spare parts is generally recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services 
intevac performs research and development work under various government sponsored research contracts 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of costs actually incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
intevac considers fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs actually incurred in performance of the contract 
revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
intevac determines the percentage completed based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to total estimated costs expected upon completion of the contract 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined 
inventories inventories are priced using average actual costs and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
intevac evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on intevac s business  financial condition and results of operations 
warranty intevac estimates the costs that may be incurred under the warranty we provide and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the related revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
intevac s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as intevac s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 

table of contents income taxes intevac accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required 
if actual results differ from these estimates  intevac could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on intevac s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with intevac s expectations could have a material impact on intevac s results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets intevac reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  intevac may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and a market multiples approach 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
in the fourth quarter of  intevac recorded an impairment charge of million for goodwill and purchased technology intangible assets due to a decline in market value and lower revenue expectations in light of current operating performance and future operating expectations 
equity based compensation intevac records compensation expense for equity based awards under sfas r using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires intevac to estimate the expected volatility of the price of intevac s common stock and the expected life of the equity based awards 
sfas r also requires forfeiture estimates of equity based awards 
estimating volatility  expected life and forfeitures requires significant judgment and an analysis of historical data 
intevac may have to increase compensation expense for equity based awards if actual results differ from intevac s estimates significantly
