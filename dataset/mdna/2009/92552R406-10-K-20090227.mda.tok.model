the following financial highlights are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap viad corp consolidated total revenues of billion  an increase of percent over revenues net income of million compared to million in income per share of compared to in 
table of contents income from discontinued operations of  in primarily related to certain obligations associated with previously sold operations

viad also recorded restructuring reversals of  related to certain restructuring costs that were less than previous estimates viad completed the acquisition of becker group on january  for million 
becker group generated million in revenue during cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  debt was million as of december  viad repurchased  shares of its common stock for million in ges revenues of million  an increase of percent over revenues segment operating income of million  an increase of percent over experiential marketing services revenues of million  an increase of percent over revenues segment operating income of million compared to a loss in of million travel and recreation services revenues of million  an increase of percent over revenues segment operating income of million compared to million in non gaap measure the following discussion includes a presentation of adjusted ebitda  which is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons 
adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
this non gaap measure should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda primarily as a performance measure and believes that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this non gaap measure is net income 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  non cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes  impairment losses or recoveries  and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
because adjusted ebitda does not consider the above items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net income as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of the company s performance 

table of contents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income is as follows in thousands adjusted ebitda impairment recoveries losses  net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization income from discontinued operations net income the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from to was primarily driven by favorable operating income at ges and exhibitgroup giltspur and lower corporate activities expense  partially offset by lower interest income 
the slight increase in adjusted ebitda of  from to was primarily driven by favorable operating income at ges and lower corporate activities expense  mostly offset by unfavorable operating results at exhibitgroup giltspur  lower interest income  higher restructuring costs and the gains on sale of corporate assets 
results of operations vs 
revenues for increased percent to billion from billion in the increase was a result of strong growth at both ges and exhibitgroup giltspur  as well as the acquisition of becker group 
income before income taxes and minority interest was million for compared to million for income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the increase in income from continuing operations was largely due to an increase in segment operating income and higher tax benefits of million in versus million in related to the favorable resolution of tax matters 
these favorable items were mostly offset by impairment charges of million million after tax  including million primarily related to goodwill and other intangible assets at becker group and million related to certain intangible assets associated with melville  ges united kingdom operation 
net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for net income for includes income from discontinued operations of  or per diluted share  relating to certain obligations associated with previously sold operations 
net income for includes income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  relating to the settlement of a real estate participation interest associated with a parcel of land sold by a discontinued operation several years ago 
ges 
revenues for ges were million for  an increase of percent from the amount of million 
the increase was primarily driven by positive show rotation revenue of million and strong exhibitor discretionary spending on the rotating shows  partially offset by a percent decline in base same show revenue 
management defines base same show revenue as revenue from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year 
base same shows represented approximately percent of ges revenue in segment operating income increased percent to million in as compared to million in  primarily as a result of the revenue growth 
operating margins were percent in as compared to percent in in general  the exhibition and event industry is experiencing signs of the economic slow down  which is negatively impacting trade show attendance and exhibitor participation 
additionally  the pricing environment remains somewhat challenging 
the prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows 
although ges has a diversified revenue base and long term contracts for future shows  revenue growth is affected by general economic and industry specific conditions 
in  management expects same show revenues to decline by approximately percent and show rotation to negatively impact revenues by approximately million due to several major  non annual shows that occurred in additionally  management expects the stronger us dollar to result in unfavorable currency translation of approximately million in revenue as compared to management remains focused on increasing productivity and controlling costs  including the implementation of cost reduction efforts 
ges and exhibitgroup giltspur are subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs  about one fourth of which expire each year 
although labor relations between the companies and labor are currently stable  disruptions during 
table of contents future contract negotiations could occur  with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of ges and or exhibitgroup giltspur 
experiential marketing services 
revenues of the experiential marketing services segment were million in  up percent from million in included in the amount was million of revenue earned by becker group 
on an organic basis without becker group s revenue  revenue increased percent to million as compared to million in driven by new business and increased revenue from existing clients at exhibitgroup giltspur 
segment operating income for was million including a loss of  from becker group compared to an operating loss of million for on an organic basis without becker group s operating loss  segment operating results improved by million to million due to the revenue growth at exhibitgroup giltspur 
in response to a challenging exhibit construction market  management is focused on repositioning exhibitgroup giltspur as an experience marketing agency to capture a greater share of clients marketing budgets by delivering comprehensive  innovative  value added solutions that enable clients to generate a higher return on their face to face marketing investments 
management is also focused on improving the sales pipeline and win rate to drive profitable revenue growth  as well as cost control  productivity enhancements and increased capacity utilization in order to improve profitability in future years 
revenue growth is affected by general economic and industry specific conditions and visibility over future revenues continues to be poor 
although the experiential marketing services segment has a diversified revenue base  a portion of the segment s revenue is generated from sales to regional shopping malls and lifestyle centers  including sales of holiday themed events and experiences and retail merchandising units 
as a result of the economic slow down  management is expecting both shopping center clients and exhibitors to reduce their spending in additionally  management expects the stronger us dollar to result in unfavorable currency translation of approximately million in revenue as compared to travel and recreation services 
revenues of the travel and recreation services segment were million for  an increase of percent from million in segment operating income was million in compared to million in operating margins were percent for compared to percent in as discussed below  results in this segment were favorably impacted by exchange rates during resulting in approximately million and  in additional revenue and segment operating income  respectively  as compared to brewster experienced a decline in passenger volumes as a result of reduced international travel to canada 
glacier park realized improved occupancy and room revenue at its inns and lodges due to stronger domestic travel 
during  approximately percent of revenue and percent of operating income generated by viad s travel and recreation services segment was derived through its canadian operations 
these operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation  and accordingly  increases in the value of the canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes  and  therefore  revenue and operating income in the travel and recreation services segment 
the operating results related to viad s canadian travel and recreation services subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of and for and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s consolidated results of operations have been favorably impacted by the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar as it relates to the translation of its canadian travel and recreation services operations 
decreases in the exchange rates may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons when operating results are translated into us dollars 
viad s travel and recreations services segment is affected by consumer discretionary spending on tourism activities 
as a result of the global economic slowdown  management expects results in its travel and recreation services segment to be impacted by tourism declines in additionally  management expects the stronger us dollar to result in unfavorable currency translation of approximately million in revenue as compared to glacier park operates the concession portion of its business under concession contracts with the us national park service the park service for glacier national park and with the canadian government for waterton lakes national park 
glacier park s year lease with the canadian government expires in with glacier park having an option to renew for two additional terms of years each 
glacier park s original year concession contract with the park service that was to expire on december   has been extended for four one year periods and now expires on december  the park service  in its sole discretion  may continue extending glacier park s concession contract in one year increments 
when this contract ultimately expires  glacier park will have the opportunity to bid on a new concession contract 
if glacier park does secure a new contract  possible terms would be for  or years 
if a new concessionaire is selected by the park service  glacier park s remaining business would consist of the operations at waterton lakes national park and east glacier  montana  which generated approximately percent of glacier park s total revenue in in such a circumstance  glacier park would be entitled to an amount equal to its possessory interest  which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed  fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at glacier national park during the term of the concession contract 

table of contents this value would be based on the reconstruction cost of a new unit of like kind  less physical depreciation  but not to exceed fair market value 
glacier park generated approximately percent of travel and recreation services full year segment operating income 
corporate activities 
corporate activities expense of million for decreased from million in this decrease was primarily related to a reduction in share based compensation expense in interest income 
interest income of million for decreased from million for the decrease was due to lower interest rates as well as lower average cash balances in as compared to resulting from viad s acquisitions and share repurchases

income taxes 
the effective tax rate on income before income taxes and minority interest for was percent compared to percent for the relatively low effective tax rates compared to the statutory rate were primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of tax matters of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  viad recorded a tax benefit of million in related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities due to a reduction in the enacted tax rates in canada

litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could be decided against viad 
although the amount of liability as of december  with respect to these matters is not ascertainable  viad believes that any resulting liability  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  including insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on viad s business  financial position or results of operations

see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to viad  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on october of each year 
goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
viad s reporting units are defined  and goodwill is tested  at either an operating segment level  or at the component level of an operating segment  depending on various factors including the internal reporting structure of the operating segment  the level of integration among components  the sharing of assets among components  and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations 
as of december   viad had goodwill of million related to the ges operating segment 
for goodwill impairment testing purposes  this goodwill is assigned to and tested at the ges component level  based on its discrete geographical operations in the united states  united kingdom and canada 
as of december   viad had goodwill of million related to the becker group operating segment within the experiential marketing services reportable segment  and goodwill of million related to the brewster operating segment within the travel and recreation services reportable segment 
both the becker group and brewster operating segments are considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology income approach in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
during the fourth quarter of  viad performed its goodwill impairment testing under the income approach described above 
accordingly  the most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units related to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit  and the reporting unit cost of capital discount rate applied to those cash flows 
during this time frame  viad significantly reduced its expected future revenue  operating income and cash flow forecasts for compared to  across all of its operating segments as the company believes that there will be lower overall customer spending for its goods and services 
these reductions were driven by the accelerated deterioration of the macroeconomic environment  increased uncertainties in the marketplace  the global economic downturn in general and unfavorable foreign currency translation 
based on these facts and circumstances  the company s forecasts and projections assume a significant decline in viad s aggregate full year revenue  and a decline in full year segment operating income compared to levels 
viad s goodwill impairment valuation models also assume a modest recovery in the subsequent two year time frame  and moderate inflationary type growth in the longer term 
viad assumed terminal growth rates for its reporting units which approximate long term inflationary levels 
furthermore  the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates discount rates were estimated using a build up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit 
finally  in order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates  the company performed a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to viad s market capitalization on the measurement date 
based on the company s goodwill impairment testing  viad recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million in the fourth quarter of related to the becker group reporting unit 
although there was no indicated impairment related to the other reporting units for which goodwill had been assigned and tested  the company has experienced a significant narrowing of the margin between the estimated fair values of the reporting units and their related net book values under step one of the goodwill impairment test 
as noted above  the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
due to the substantial uncertainties in the current economic environment  a further reduction in the company s expected revenue  operating income or cash flow forecasts  or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital  could trigger an interim goodwill impairment test  which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges 

table of contents furthermore  management continues to monitor the market capitalization of the company as declines in market capitalization could be indicative of possible goodwill impairment 
during the first quarter of  the company has experienced additional declines in its market capitalization which management will continue to evaluate with respect to its assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
an ongoing decline in market capitalization could result in future impairment charges 
in addition  as of december   the company had remaining goodwill of million related to the acquisition of becker group in  and million of goodwill related to the acquisition of melville in  which constitutes ges united kingdom reporting unit 
due to the recent timing of these acquisitions  there is a higher level of sensitivity with respect to the estimated fair values of these reporting units relative to their respective book values 
accordingly  changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these reporting units may result in additional goodwill impairment charges 
other intangible assets not subject to amortization  which primarily consist of trademarks and trade names  are also tested for impairment annually on october of each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
other intangible assets not subject to amortization are also reviewed annually to determine whether an indefinite useful life remains appropriate 
the company also uses an income approach to measure the estimated fair values of its trademarks and trade names not subject to amortization 
intangible assets subject to amortization are stated at cost  net of accumulated amortization  and are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist of customer contracts and relationships  design libraries  non compete agreements and proprietary technology 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its impairment testing of other intangible assets not subject to amortization and also completed an impairment evaluation of intangible assets subject to amortization due to the continued deterioration of the macroeconomic environment and other factors discussed above 
as a result of this testing  the company recorded aggregate other intangible asset impairment charges of million 
of the total amount  million of other intangible asset impairments related to a trade name and a contract based intangible at becker group and million of other intangible asset impairments related to trade names and customer related intangible assets at melville 
the assumptions used to complete the impairment testing of other intangible assets were consistent with those used in the goodwill impairment testing described above 
to the extent that goodwill and another asset of the same reporting unit were tested at the same time  the other asset was tested for impairment before goodwill 
as of december   the company had aggregate intangible assets not subject to amortization of million and aggregate intangible assets subject to amortization of million 
as noted above  due to the substantial uncertainties in the current economic environment  a further reduction in the company s expected revenue  operating income or cash flow forecasts could trigger interim impairment tests for these intangible assets  which may result in additional impairment charges 
income taxes viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  the company must estimate its actual current income tax liability  and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
as of december  and  viad had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
these deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences  and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of these assets from future taxable income 
furthermore  the company considers available evidence in performing this assessment including the consideration of both historical and forecasted taxable income 
as of december  and  viad had a valuation allowance of  and  respectively  related to certain state deferred tax assets at exhibitgroup giltspur 
with respect to all other deferred tax assets  management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more likely than not 
viad is subject to regular and recurring audits by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company conducts or had previously conducted operations 
these include us federal and most state jurisdictions  and certain foreign jurisdictions including canada  the united kingdom and germany 
effective january   viad adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  viad exercises judgment in determining its income tax provision due to transactions  credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as of december  and  viad had accrued 
table of contents gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of million and million  respectively 
in addition  as of december  and  viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for continuing operations of million and million  respectively 
upon adoption of fin  the company elected to continue to classify interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities as a component of income tax expense 
in addition to the above  viad had accrued gross liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of  as of both december  and in addition  as of december  and  viad had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for discontinued operations of  and  respectively 
future tax resolutions or settlements that may occur related to these uncertain tax positions would be recorded through discontinued operations net of federal tax effects  if applicable 
as of december   the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations of million including federal income tax effects of million would favorably affect viad s effective tax rate  if recognized  as the related uncertain tax positions are permanent in nature 
however  if amounts accrued are less than amounts ultimately assessed by the taxing authorities  viad would record additional income tax expense 
to the extent that the company has favorable tax settlements  or determines that accrued amounts are no longer needed due to a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations or other reasons  such liabilities would be reversed as a reduction of income tax expense net of federal tax effects  if applicable in the period such determination is made 
the company has been subject to certain foreign tax audits in multiple canadian jurisdictions related to the through tax years 
as a result of such audits  certain issues were raised regarding the tax treatment of specific intercompany debt transactions 
these uncertain tax positions had been accrued as tax liabilities  as the company had not previously recognized any tax benefits associated with those transactions in its income tax provision 
during the fourth quarter of  viad reached a joint settlement agreement with the canadian taxing jurisdictions pertaining to the through tax audits 
the settlement agreement resulted in gross tax reassessments of million consisting of million of tax due  and million of related interest 
as of december   the total amount of million was included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other current liabilities 
furthermore  viad paid the reassessments of million in january in addition  the joint settlement agreement also resulted in certain tax reassessments for which the company would receive aggregate tax refunds of million 
as of december   the amount of million was included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption  other current assets 
the company received these refunds in february the company has uncertain tax positions in us federal and various state jurisdictions for which the unrecognized tax benefits may significantly decrease due to effective settlements or a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations 
these tax positions primarily relate to the deductibility of certain expenses and the method of filing for combined and separate entities 
accordingly  the company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately million excluding federal income tax effects of million of its uncertain tax positions could be resolved or settled within the next months which would reduce the amount of accrued income taxes payable 
if such tax resolutions or settlements occur  they could result in cash payments  the recognition of additional income tax expense  or the reversal of accrued income taxes which may impact viad s effective tax rate in future periods 
insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability and property loss claims 
the aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to viad s continuing operations was million as of december  of this total  million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general auto liability claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling million as of december   primarily related to workers compensation liabilities 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels  which generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
viad does not maintain a self insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement 
viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million and million in and  respectively 
pension and postretirement benefits viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
the company presently anticipates contributing  to its funded pension plans and  to its unfunded pension plans in viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period 
table of contents that services are provided by employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad expects to contribute  to the plans in the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent in the year  declining one half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for post age plan participants was eight percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
for pre age plan participants  the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was seven percent in the year  declining one percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  the weighted average discount rates used to determine the domestic pension and postretirement benefit obligations were both percent in and percent and percent in  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to determine the foreign pension benefit obligations as of december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the domestic plans for and were percent and percent  respectively 
the net periodic benefit cost for the foreign pension plans used weighted average discount rates of percent and percent for and  respectively 
the discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review  and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high quality  hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments 
the expected return on plan assets used to determine the domestic net periodic pension cost for both and was percent 
the foreign pension plans used rates of percent and percent for and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets used to determine net periodic postretirement benefit cost for both and was percent

no share based compensation costs were capitalized during  or viad uses the black scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary 
these assumptions include viad s expected stock price volatility  the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding  the expected dividend yield on viad common stock  and the risk free interest rate

the intent of this guidance is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
r  and other gaap 
the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset is to be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
however  the disclosure requirements are to be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
fsp fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  viad will adopt fsp fas in the first quarter of and will apply its provisions prospectively

 earnings per share 
this guidance establishes that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
fsp eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  furthermore  all prior period earnings per share data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively to conform to the provisions of fsp eitf accordingly  viad will adopt fsp eitf in the first quarter of during and prior years  the company had certain share based payment transactions which would be subject to the guidance set forth in fsp eitf as of december   viad had outstanding  shares of nonvested restricted stock awards and  shares of nonvested performance based restricted stock awards  all of which contain nonforfeitable dividend rights 
accordingly  the company believes that these share based payment awards are deemed participating securities pursuant to fsp eitf and subject to the computation of income per share under the two class method 
although the company has not finalized its computations  it currently believes that the adoption of fsp eitf may result in a material reduction of viad s computation of basic income per share  and to a lesser extent  may impact diluted income per share 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk viad s market risk exposures relate to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the earnings of viad 
commodity risk is the risk that changing prices will adversely affect results of operations 
viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in canada and the united kingdom and to a lesser extent in certain other countries 
the functional currency of viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
accordingly  for purposes of consolidation  viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar may result in material changes to viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets 
viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in equity of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during and  an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of million and a gain of million  respectively  were recorded in other comprehensive income 
in addition  for purposes of consolidation  the revenues  expenses  gains and losses related to viad s foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period 
as a result  viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign subsidiaries  when translated  may vary from period to period  even when the functional currency amounts have not changed 
such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons 
viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results 
as noted above  viad primarily conducts its foreign operations in canada and the united kingdom 
accordingly  the operating results related to its canadian subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s segment operating income has been favorably impacted by approximately  in from the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar as it relates to the translation of its canadian operations 
a hypothetical change of ten percent in the canadian exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately million 
the operating results related to its united kingdom subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s segment operating income has been unfavorably impacted by approximately  in from the weakening of the british pound relative to the us dollar 
a hypothetical change of ten percent in the british pound exchange rate would have resulted in a change to operating income of approximately  viad is exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk as its foreign subsidiaries have certain revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary 
from time to time  viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  net of the effect of the related forward contracts  has historically been immaterial to viad s consolidated results of operations 
as of december  and  viad did not have any significant foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
viad is exposed to short term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations 
viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations 
as of december  viad had variable rate debt outstanding of million under the credit facility 
interest payments related to viad s variable rate debt outstanding are indexed to libor 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in short term interest rates of and basis points  viad s income before income 
table of contents taxes and minority interest would have been lower by approximately  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
viad s subsidiaries have exposure to changing fuel prices 
periodically  one of these subsidiaries enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume  by fuel product  to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract  which is generally no longer than one year 
the main objective of viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins 
there were no fuel contracts outstanding as of december  or
