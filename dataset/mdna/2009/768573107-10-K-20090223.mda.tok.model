overview we were founded in may by experienced industry leaders with a vision to improve the performance of wide area distributed computing 
having significant experience in caching technology  our executive management team understood that existing approaches failed to address adequately all of the root causes of this poor performance 
we determined that these performance problems could be best solved by simultaneously addressing inefficiencies in software applications and wide area networks wans as well as insufficient or unavailable bandwidth 
this innovative approach served as the foundation of the development of our products 
we began commercial shipments of our products in may and have since sold our products to over  customers worldwide 
we now offer several product lines including steelhead appliances  central management console  interceptor and steelhead mobile 
we are headquartered in san francisco  california 
our personnel are located throughout the us and in over twenty countries worldwide 
we expect to continue to add personnel in the us and internationally to provide additional geographic sales  research and development  general and administrative and technical support coverage 
company strategy our goal is to establish our solution as the preeminent performance and efficiency standard for organizations relying on wide area distributed computing 
key elements of our strategy include maintain and extend our technological advantages we believe that we offer the broadest ability to enable rapid  reliable access to applications and data for our customers 
we intend to enhance our position as a leader and innovator in the wan optimization market 
we also intend to continue to sell new capabilities into our installed base 
continuing investments in research and development are critical to maintaining our technological advantage 
enhance and extend our product line we plan to introduce new models of our current products as well as enhancements to their capabilities in order to address our customers size and application requirements 
we also plan to introduce new products to extend our market and utilize our technology platform to extend our capabilities 

table of contents in august  we began selling our steelhead mobile product line  which includes a software client version of our steelhead appliances  which delivers lan like application performance to any employee laptop  whether on the road  working from home or connected wirelessly in the office 
in february  we announced the introduction of the riverbed services platform rsp  which enables the delivery of virtualized edge services without the need to deploy additional physical servers at remote or branch offices 
rsp allows customers to deploy services from an array of vendors on steelhead appliances in a self contained partition to minimize the hardware infrastructure footprint at the branch office 
in august  we introduced the series models of our steelhead appliances 
the series models represent the next generation of our steelhead appliances 
in february  we acquired mazu networks  inc mazu helps organizations manage  secure and optimize the availability and performance of global applications 
the acquisition allows us to meet enterprise and service provider customer demands by extending our suite of wan optimization products to include global application performance  reporting and analytics 
increase market awareness to generate increased demand for our products  we will continue promoting our brand and the effectiveness of our comprehensive wan optimization solution 
scale our distribution channels we intend to leverage and expand our indirect channels to extend our geographic reach and market penetration 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through resellers 
we derived of our revenue through indirect channels in we expect revenue from resellers to continue to constitute a substantial majority of our future revenue 
during  we added new reseller partners  large systems integrators and managed service providers 
also in  we expanded our direct sales force presence in new countries 
enhance and extend our support and services capabilities we plan to enhance and extend our support and services capabilities to continue to support our growing global customer base 
in  we increased our sales focus on service contract renewals on our existing customer base  we developed and distributed training programs directed at our partners  and expanded our professional service offering 
major trends affecting our financial results company outlook we believe that our current value proposition  which enables customers to improve the performance of their applications and access to their data across wans  while also offering the ability to simplify it infrastructure and realize significant capital and operating cost savings  should allow us to continue to grow our business 
our product revenue growth rate will depend significantly on continued growth in the wide area data services wds  market and our ability to continue to attract new customers in that market and generate additional sales from existing customers 
our growth in support and services revenue is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders  product mix  
table of contents average selling prices and costs of our products and general economic conditions 
our ability to achieve profitability in the future will also be affected by the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  support  marketing  development  and general and administrative capabilities to grow our business 
the largest component of our expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation 
macroeconomic environment during the domestic and international economic environment turned sharply negative  with most developed countries  including the us  falling into economic recessions 
credit markets and bank lending contracted suddenly in the third quarter of making credit generally harder to obtain for most businesses and consumers 
commodity prices declined sharply in the second half of as demand for commodities decreased 
this resulted in consumer spending being reduced sharply in the second half of this macroeconomic environment caused the growth trend in corporate spending on it infrastructure to slow in and this trend is forecasted to continue or slow down further in the first half of revenue our revenue has grown rapidly since we began shipping products in may  increasing from million in to million in revenue grew by in to million from million in we believe that our revenue growth in  when the global macroeconomic environment negatively impacted many businesses  is a positive sign that our products have a significant value proposition to our customers and that the wan optimization market is still expanding despite the challenging macroeconomic environment 
costs and expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
personnel related costs  including stock based compensation  are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
as of december  we had employees  an increase of from the employees at december  the increase in employees is the most significant driver behind the increase in costs and operating expenses in the increase in employees was required to support our increased revenue 
the timing of additional hires has and could materially affect our operating expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  in any particular period 
stock based compensation expense was million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant stock based compensation expense and anticipate further growth in stock based compensation expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements could be adversely affected 

table of contents the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  inventory valuation and allowances for doubtful accounts 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition our software is integrated on appliance hardware and is essential to the functionality of the product 
as a result  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  for all transactions involving the sale of software 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  which is when product title transfers to the customer  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our appliances and software licenses 
product sales include a perpetual license to our software 
product revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of title at shipment  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
product revenue on sales to channel partners is recorded once we have received persuasive evidence of an end user and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
substantially all of our product sales have been sold in combination with support services  which consist of software updates and support 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
support includes access to technical support personnel and content via the internet and telephone 
support services also include an extended warranty for the repair or replacement of defective hardware 
revenue for support services is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one year 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
through december   in virtually all of our contracts  the only element that remained undelivered at the time of delivery of the product was support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element for which we do not have a fair value is support services  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately  and vsoe for support services is measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue 
table of contents recognition have been met 
deferred product revenue as of december  and  was approximately million and million  respectively 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history with the customer 
if the customer is not deemed creditworthy  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and financial accounting standards board interpretation fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
 and had adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
in accordance with apb  stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  resulted from stock option grants at exercise prices that  for financial reporting purposes  were deemed to be below the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as of december   deferred stock based compensation relative to these options was approximately million  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over the service period  which generally corresponds to the vesting period 
during the years ended december    and  we amortized million  million and million  respectively  of deferred compensation expense  net of reversals for terminations  related to these options 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the prospective transition method  which requires us to apply the provisions of sfas no 
r to new awards granted  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled  after the effective date 
new awards granted include stock options  rsus  and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan the purchase plan 
under this method  stock based compensation expense recognized beginning january  is based on a combination of the following a the grant date fair value of stock option  rsu and employee stock purchase plan awards granted or modified after january   and b the amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to stock option awards granted prior to january   which was calculated using the intrinsic value method as previously permitted under apb under sfas no 
r  we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we use the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally four years 
on september   the effective date of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering ipo  we implemented the purchase plan  which has a two year offering period and two purchases per year 
the fair value of shares granted under the purchase plan is amortized over the two year offering period 
under the purchase plan  employees may purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions at a price per share that is of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock as of the beginning of an applicable offering period or the applicable purchase date  with purchases generally every six months 

table of contents in the year ended december   we granted  rsus 
the fair value of rsus is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant and the related compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  is amortized on a straight line basis over the service period of four years 
the fair value of options granted and purchase plan shares was estimated at the date of grant using the following assumptions year ended december  employee stock options expected life in years risk free interest rate volatility weighted average fair value of grants purchase plan expected life in years risk free interest rate volatility weighted average fair value of grants assumptions used in exclude the assumptions used related to the modification accounting associated with the tender offer 
the expected term represents the period that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
for the years ended december   and  we have elected to use the simplified method of determining the expected term as permitted by sec staff accounting bulletin and due to our lack of sufficient historical exercise data 
the computation of expected volatility for the years ended december    and is based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry and market capitalization data 
as required by sfas no 
r  management estimated expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the estimated forfeiture rates for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
during  we filed a tender offer statement on schedule to with the sec pursuant to which we extended an offer to non section reporting employees to exchange up to an aggregate of  options to purchase shares of our common stock  whether vested or unvested 
options granted prior to may  with an exercise price greater than of the closing market price on april  were eligible to be tendered pursuant to the offer 
the closing market price on april  was 
in accordance with the tender offer the to  the number of new options issued was based on an exchange ratio of new shares for each share exchanged based on the number of options tendered 
a total of  options were tendered and cancelled  and a total of  options were granted on may  at per share 
the new options retain the vesting schedule of the options exchanged 
the to is subject to modification accounting pursuant to sfas no 
r whereby the total compensation cost measured at the date of modification is the portion of the grant date fair value of the original award for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered or has already been rendered at that date plus the incremental cost resulting from the modification 
the incremental cost resulting from the modification is measured as the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified 
the incremental fair value of million for the new awards was computed using an expected life of years to years  a risk free interest rate of to and a volatility of to 
the  incremental fair value of the vested awards was recognized as compensation 
table of contents expense on the modification date in the million incremental fair value of the unvested awards is being amortized over the remaining service period 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to stock options granted under sfas no 
r but not yet recognized was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures of million 
this cost will be amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period 
amortization in the years ended december   and  was million   and million  respectively 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested rsus granted under sfas no 
r to employees and directors but not yet recognized was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures of million 
this cost will be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of years 
amortization in the year ended december  was million and zero in the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   there was million  net of estimated forfeitures  left to be amortized under our purchase plan  which will be amortized over the remaining vesting period  which is months 
amortization in the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under this method  income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax expense and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current income tax expense together with assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax purposes versus financial accounting purposes that may create net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we rely on management estimates and assumptions in preparing our income tax provision 
in the year ended december  and prior years  in accordance with sfas no  we recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our historical levels of income  expectations of future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies 
a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was recorded because of the uncertainty of the realization of our deferred tax assets  which is primarily dependent upon future taxable income 
in the year ended december   management reevaluated the need for a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets as a result of cumulative profits generated in the most recent three year period as well as other positive evidence 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets and recorded a tax benefit of million in this benefit was partially offset by a provision for income taxes of million for related to federal  foreign and state income taxes 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets 

table of contents to the extent we conclude that future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies warrant the release of all or a portion of the remaining valuation allowance  which totaled  as of december   a further reduction to the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax benefit in such period 
we are subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain tax positions we have taken  such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
as of december   we have million recorded for such contingencies and have recognized a decrease in our deferred tax asset of  we have elected to record interest and penalties recognized in accordance with fin in the financial statements as income taxes 
inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
a portion of our inventory relates to evaluation units located at customer locations  as some of our customers test our equipment prior to purchasing 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand is written down to its estimated realizable value based on historical usage  expected demand  and with respect to evaluation units  the historical conversion rate and age of the units 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products  the timing of new product introductions and technological obsolescence of our products 
inventory write downs are reflected as an increase to the cost of product and amounted to approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in inventory obsolescence write downs was related to legacy inventory and resulted from the launch of the new series  which is expected to replace the older legacy models 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the applicable portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
for those receivables not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our appliances and software licenses and from support and services 
product revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our steelhead products and is typically recognized upon shipment 
support and services revenue includes unspecified software license updates and product support

cost of support and service revenue consists of personnel costs of technical support and professional services personnel  spare parts and logistics services 
as we expand internationally and into other sectors  we may incur additional costs to conform our products to comply with local laws or local product specifications 
in addition  as we expand internationally  we will continue to hire additional technical support personnel to support our growing international customer base 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix and average selling prices of our products  new product introductions and enhancements  the cost of our appliance hardware  expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations  cost of support and service personnel  and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold

sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and include personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers  and are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to make investments in sales and marketing with the intent to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base by increasing the number of sales personnel worldwide  expanding our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  increasing channel penetration  building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events 
we expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase and continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive and sales and marketing expenses do not immediately result in increased revenue 
hiring additional sales personnel reduces short term operating margins until the sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance

based on the terms of the settlement agreement we recorded operating expense of million during no such expenses existed in other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income on our cash and marketable securities  interest expense  and foreign currency exchange losses

year ended december  dollars in thousands interest income interest expense other total other income  net compared to other income expense  net  decreased in the year ended december  due to decreased interest income on cash and marketable securities balances as a result of declining interest rates 
weighted average interest rates applicable to our cash and marketable securities balances decreased to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  other expense in the year ended december  and consists primarily of foreign currency losses 
compared to other income expense  net  increased in the year ended december  primarily due to interest income on higher cash and marketable securities balances 
we did not have interest expense in  as we paid off the balance of our credit facility on october  other expense decreased due to recording our preferred stock warrants to fair value in and no such adjustment was required in in the year ended december  we recognized a  charge to record our preferred stock warrants at fair value 
subsequent to our ipo  we were no longer required to record the warrants to fair value 
other expense in the years ended december  consists primarily of foreign currency losses 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes was million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our income tax provision benefit consists of federal  foreign  and state income taxes 
our effective tax rate was  and for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for as compared to was primarily the result of the reduction in income tax expense of million due to the reduction of valuation allowances during the fourth quarter of against our domestic deferred tax assets 
this benefit was partially offset by a provision for income taxes of million in related to federal  foreign and state income taxes 

table of contents our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state taxes  significant permanent differences and the change in our valuation allowances on our net deferred tax assets 
significant permanent differences arise from the portion of stock based compensation expense that is not expected to generate a tax deduction  such as stock compensation expense on grants to foreign employees  our purchase plan and incentive stock options  offset by the actual tax benefits in the current periods from disqualifying dispositions of those shares 
in the year ended december  and in prior years  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of the realization of the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our historical levels of income  expectations of future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies 
in the year ended december   management reevaluated the need for a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets as a result of cumulative profits generated in the most recent three year period as well as other positive evidence 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets 
to the extent we conclude that future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies warrant the release of all or a portion of the remaining valuation allowance  which totaled  as of december   a reduction in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax benefit in such period 
our effective tax rate in has fluctuated significantly on a quarterly basis 
the effective tax rate can be affected by our stock based compensation expense  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets  changes in actual results versus our estimates  or changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in october  the federal research and development tax credit was reinstated 
the impact of the credit on our effective tax rate is reflected in the tax rate for the year ended december  we are subject to potential income tax audits on open tax years by any taxing jurisdiction which we operate in 
the taxing authorities of the most significant jurisdictions are the united states internal revenue service  california franchise tax board and hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom uk 
we do not anticipate any material adjustments to our tax provisions relating to previously filed tax returns 
the statute of limitations for federal  state  and uk tax purposes are generally three  four  and three years respectively  however  we continue to carryover tax attributes prior to these periods for federal and state purposes  which would still be open for examination by the respective tax authorities 
accordingly  all years since our inception are open to tax examinations for federal and state purposes 
our uk tax returns from to the present are open for examination 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended december  in management s opinion  the data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  and reflects all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this data

as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
in addition  a significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last month of the quarter  which we believe reflects customer buying patterns of products similar to ours and other products in the technology industry generally 
as a result  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term 
commencing with the first shipment of our products in the second quarter of  revenue has increased sequentially in all but one quarter  due to increases in the number of products sold to new and existing customers and international expansion 
cost of revenue has increased sequentially each quarter in absolute dollars  however  has decreased over time as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in gross margins is primarily due to higher margins on product revenue as a result of lower unit product costs 
excluding the impact of the quantum settlement of million in the third quarter of  operating expenses increased sequentially in all quarters  as we continued to add headcount and related costs to accommodate our growing business

marketable securities consist of government sponsored enterprise obligations  treasury bills and corporate bonds and notes 
we adopted sfas no 
in the year ended december  the fair value of marketable securities is determined in accordance with sfas no 
 which defines the fair value as the exit price in the principal market in which we would transact 
the fair value of our marketable securities has not materially fluctuated from historical cost 
the accumulated unrealized gains  net of tax  on marketable securities recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our stockholders equity is approximately  the recent volatility in the credit markets has increased the risk of material fluctuations in the fair value of marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities increased by million to million in the year ended december  pursuant to certain lease agreements and as security for our merchant services agreement with our financial institution  we are required to maintain cash reserves  classified as restricted cash 
current restricted cash totaled  at december  and  at december   and long term restricted cash totaled million at december  and long term restricted cash is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consists primarily of funds held as collateral for letters of credit for the security deposit on the leases of our corporate headquarters and is restricted until the end of the lease terms on august  and july  since the fourth quarter of  we have expanded our operations internationally 
our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and therefore changes in foreign exchange rates have not materially affected our cash flows from operations 
as we fund our international operations  our cash and cash equivalents are affected by changes in exchange rates 
to date  the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has not been material 
cash flows from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  product costs  outside services  and rent payments 
our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we grow our revenue and spend on hiring personnel in order to grow our business 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  primarily due to increased profitability after excluding the effects of non cash stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to investments in marketable securities and capital expenditures to support our growth 
cash used in investing activities increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to additional purchases of marketable securities and additional capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities in the year ended december  consisted of repurchases of common stock and proceeds and tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under our purchase plan 
on april   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program  which authorizes us to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock during a period not to exceed months from the board authorization date 
the program does not require us to purchase a minimum number of shares  and may be suspended  modified or discontinued at any time 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock under this program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  or an average of per share 
the timing and amounts of these repurchases were based on market conditions and other factors including price  regulatory requirements and capital availability 
the share repurchases were financed by available cash balances and cash from operations 
we believe that our net proceeds from operations  together with our cash balance at december   will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
in february  we acquired mazu networks  inc for approximately million of cash which was paid for from our existing cash balance 
in the future  we may enter into other arrangements for potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  year ending december  total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable  legally binding and specify terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of payment 
obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  nor did we have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
other at december  and  we did not have commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations or other such debt arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and therefore our revenue and receivables are not subject to significant foreign currency risk 
we do incur certain operating expenses in currencies other than the us dollar and therefore are subject to volatility in cash flows due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro  australian dollar and singapore dollar 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts since exchange rate fluctuations have had minimal impact on our operating results and cash flows 
we sell predominantly in us dollars  and the recent increase in value of the us dollar relative to most other major currencies may negatively affect our sales as any foreign currency devaluation against the us dollar would increase the real cost of our products to our customers and partners in foreign markets where we sell in us dollars 
in addition  sales would be negatively affected if we chose to more heavily discount our product price in foreign markets to maintain competitive pricing 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market mutual funds  government sponsored enterprise obligations  treasury bills  and other money market securities 
due to the high investment quality and short duration of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair market value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
the recent volatility in the credit markets has caused a macro shift in investments into highly liquid short term investments such as us treasury bills 
this has caused a significant decline in short term interest rates  which we expect will reduce future investment income 
in addition  the volatility in the credit markets increases the risk of write downs of investments to fair market value
