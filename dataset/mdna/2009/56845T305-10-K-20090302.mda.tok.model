certain oil and natural gas industry terms used in this annual report are defined in the glossary of oil and natural gas terms set forth in item business of this annual report 
item business 
general mariner energy  inc is an independent oil and gas exploration  development  and production company 
we were incorporated in august as a delaware corporation 
our corporate headquarters are located at one briarlake plaza  suite  west sam houston parkway south  houston  texas our telephone number is and our website address is www 
mariner energy 
com 
our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange and trades under the symbol me 
we currently operate in three principal geographic areas permian basin  where we are an active driller in the prolific spraberry field at depths between  and  feet 
our increasing permian basin operation  which is characterized by long reserve life  stable drilling and production performance  and relatively lower capital requirements  somewhat counterbalances the higher geological risk  operational challenges and capital requirements attendant to most of our gulf of mexico deepwater operations 
we have expanded our presence in the region  targeting a combination of infill drilling activities in established producing trends  including the spraberry  dean and wolfcamp trends  as well as exploration activities in emerging plays such as the wolfberry and newer wolfcamp trends 
gulf of mexico deepwater  where we have actively conducted exploration and development projects since in water depths ranging from  feet up to  feet 
employing our experienced geoscientists  rich seismic database  and extensive subsea tieback expertise  we have participated in more than deepwater wells 
our deepwater exploration operation targets larger potential reserve accumulations than are generally accessible onshore or on the gulf of mexico shelf 
gulf of mexico shelf  where we drill or participate in conventional shelf wells and deep shelf wells extending to  foot water depths 
we currently pursue a two pronged strategy on the shelf  combining opportunistic acquisitions of legacy producing fields believed to hold exploitation potential and active exploration activities targeting conventional and deep shelf opportunities 
given the highly mature nature of this area and the steep production declines characteristic of most wells in this region  the goal of our shallow water or shelf operation is to maximize cash flow for reinvestment in our deepwater and permian basin operations  as well as for expansion into new operating areas 
during  we produced approximately bcfe and our average daily production rate was mmcfe per day 
at december   we had bcfe of estimated proved reserves  of which approximately were natural gas and were oil  natural gas liquids ngls and condensate 
approximately of our estimated proved reserves were classified as proved developed

recent developments gulf of mexico deepwater acquisition on december   we acquired additional working interests in our existing property  atwater valley block bass lite  for approximately million  increasing our working interest by to 
we internally estimated proved reserves attributable to the acquisition of approximately bcfe natural gas 
acquisition of incremental spraberry interests on february  and december   we acquired additional working interests in certain of our existing properties in the spraberry field in the permian basin  increasing our average working interest across these properties to approximately 
we internally estimated proved reserves attributable to the acquisition of approximately bcfe 
we operate substantially all of the assets 
the purchase prices were approximately million for the february acquisition and million for the december acquisition 
impact of worldwide financial crisis and lower commodity prices on capital program in recent years  oil and gas commodity prices generally trended upwards in response to robust demand and constrained supplies  with oil and gas prices peaking at more than per barrel and per mcf  respectively  in july in response to the sustained increase in commodity prices  the oil and gas industry experienced significant increases in activity and in demand for oil field services 
the increased demand for these services resulted in significant inflation in the cost of drilling rigs  services  equipment and labor 
in the second half of  a world wide economic recession and oversupply of natural gas in north america led to an unprecedented decline in oil and gas prices  with oil falling by more than per barrel from its peak earlier in however  the inflated cost of oil field services resulting from sustained historically high commodity prices did not decrease in line with the decline in commodity prices 
the prospect of continued low commodity prices and disproportionately high service costs has constrained the industry s capital reinvestment and undermined rates of return in new projects  particularly those in areas characterized by high costs or long reserve lives 
in order to manage our capital program within expected cash flows  we tentatively have reduced our capital budget by more than from our activities in the permian basin will focus primarily on expanding beyond our typical spraberry infill drilling operation into new exploration plays  such as the wolfberry and wolfcamp detrital trends 
we plan to delineate prospects and determine their economic viability 
our goal is to expand our prospect inventory and generate opportunities to drill when commodity prices or service costs adjust to levels expected to yield more attractive returns 
until then  we are scaling down our infill drilling and development activities to primarily lease saving operations and contractual drilling commitments 
we also anticipate substantially reduced recompletion and development activities in our gulf of mexico shelf operation until commodity price and service cost dynamics adjust to allow a more attractive rate of return 
in addition  we are allocating a disproportionate portion of our capital budget to our gulf of mexico deepwater exploration program due primarily to contractual drilling commitments 
balanced growth strategy we are a growth company and strive to increase our reserves and production from our existing asset base as well as through expansion into new operating areas 
our management team pursues a balanced growth strategy employing varying elements of exploration  development  and acquisition activities in complementary operating regions intended to achieve an overall moderate risk growth profile at attractive rates of return under most industry conditions 
exploration our exploration program is designed to facilitate organic growth through exploration in a wide variety of exploratory drilling projects  including higher risk  high impact projects that have the potential to create substantial value for our stockholders 
we view exploration as a core competency 
we typically dedicate a significant portion of our capital program each year to prospecting for new oil 
table of contents and gas fields  including in the gulf of mexico deepwater where reserve accumulations are typically much larger than those found onshore or on the shelf 
our explorationists have a distinguished track record in the gulf of mexico 
our reputation for generating high quality exploration prospects also can create potentially valuable partnering opportunities  which can enable us to participate in exploration projects developed by other operators 
development our development efforts are intended to complement our higher risk exploration projects through a variety of moderate risk activities targeted at maximizing recovery and production from known reservoirs as well as finding overlooked oil and gas accumulations in and around existing fields 
our geoscientists and engineers have a solid track record in effectively developing new fields  redeveloping legacy fields  rejuvenating production  controlling unit costs  and adding incremental reserves at attractive finding costs in both onshore and offshore fields 
our development and exploitation program strives to enhance the rate of returns of our projects  allowing us to establish critical operating mass from which to expand in our focus areas  and generate a rich portfolio of relatively lower risk engineering exploitation projects that counterbalance our higher risk exploration activities 
acquisitions in addition to our internal exploration and development activities on our existing properties  we also compete actively for new oil and gas properties through property acquisitions as well as corporate transactions 
our management team has substantial experience identifying and executing a wide variety of tactical and strategic transactions that augment our existing operations or present opportunities to expand into new operating regions 
we primarily focus our acquisition efforts on stable  onshore basins such as the permian basin  which can counterbalance our growing deepwater exploration operations  but we also respond in an opportunistic fashion to attractive acquisition opportunities in the gulf of mexico 
due to our existing prospect inventory  we are not compelled to make acquisitions in order to grow  however we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions aggressively on an opportunistic basis as an integral part of our growth strategy 
our competitive strengths we believe our core resources and strengths include diversity of assets and activities 
our assets and operations are diversified among the permian basin and the gulf of mexico deepwater and shelf 
each of these areas involves distinctly different operational characteristics  as well as different financial and operational risks and rewards 
moreover  within these operating areas we pursue a breadth of exploration  development and acquisition activities  which in turn entail unique risks and rewards 
by diversifying our assets both onshore and in the gulf  and pursuing a full range of exploration  development and acquisition activities  we strive to mitigate concentration risk and avoid overdependence on any single activity to facilitate our growth 
by maintaining a variety of investment opportunities ranging from high risk  high impact projects in the deepwater to relatively low risk  repeatable projects in the permian basin  we attempt to execute a balanced capital program and attain a more moderate company wide risk profile while still affording our stockholders the significant potential upside attendant to an active deepwater exploration company 
large prospect inventory 
we believe we have significant potential for growth through the exploration and development of our existing asset base 
we are one of the largest leaseholders among independent producers in the gulf of mexico 
additionally  we are an active participant at mms lease sales 
we were the apparent high bidder on three blocks at the outer continental shelf lease sale held on august  by the mms 
the mms awarded all three blocks to us  yielding an aggregate exposure of million 
we hold a working interest in each of these blocks 
in addition  the mms awarded us blocks on which we were the apparent high bidder at the central gulf of mexico lease sale held by the mms on march  the awarded blocks involve seven deepwater subsalt prospects both miocene and lower tertiary  four deepwater prospects  four deep shelf prospects  and one conventional shelf prospect 
our net exposure on the awarded bids was million and our working interest ranges from to 
furthermore  in the permian basin we have a large and growing asset base that we anticipate is capable of sustaining our current drilling program for a number of years 
we believe that our large acreage position makes us less dependent on acquisitions for our growth as compared to companies that have less extensive drilling inventories 

table of contents exploration expertise 
our seasoned team of geoscientists has made significant discoveries in the gulf of mexico and has achieved a cumulative success rate during the three years ended december  our geoscientists each average almost years of relevant industry experience 
we believe our emphasis on exploration allows us a competitive advantage over other companies who are either wholly dependent on acquisitions for growth or only sporadically engage in more limited exploration activities 
operational control and substantial working interests 
we serve as operator of properties representing approximately of our production and have an average working interest in our operated properties 
we believe operating our properties gives us a competitive advantage over non operating interest holders  particularly in a challenging financial environment  since operatorship better allows us to determine the extent and timing of our capital programs  as well as to assert the most direct impact on operating costs 
extensive seismic library 
we have access to recent vintage  regional d seismic data covering a significant portion of the gulf of mexico 
we use seismic technology in our exploration program to identify and assess prospects  and in our development program to assess hydrocarbon reservoirs with a goal of optimizing drilling  workover and recompletion operations 
we believe that our investment in d seismic data gives us an advantage over companies with less extensive seismic resources in that we are better able to interpret geological events and stratigraphic trends on a more precise geographical basis utilizing more detailed analytical data 
subsea tieback expertise 
we have accumulated an extensive track record in the use of subsea tieback technology  which enables production from subsea wells to existing third party production facilities through subsea flow line and umbilical infrastructure 
this technology typically allows us to avoid the significant lead time and capital commitment associated with the fabrication and installation of production platforms or floating production facilities  thereby accelerating our project start ups and reducing our financial exposure 
in turn  we believe this lowers the economic thresholds of our target prospects and allows us to exploit reserves that otherwise may be considered non commercial because of the high cost of stand alone production facilities 
properties our principal oil and gas properties are located in the permian basin and the gulf of mexico deepwater and shelf 
the gulf of mexico properties are primarily in federal waters 
the following table presents our top fields by estimated proved reserves for each principal geographic area net approximate estimated estimated working net proved proved reserves operator interest production reserves oil gas bcfe bcfe permian basin spraberry mariner gulf of mexico deepwater atwater valley bass lite mariner garden banks geauxpher mariner green canyon daniel boone w t offshore east breaks northwest nansen anadarko ewing bank north black widow eni gulf of mexico shelf vermilion mariner vermilion mariner west cameron mariner south pass mariner high island mariner ngls are included in oil 
table of contents map permian basin operations our permian basin operations historically have emphasized downspacing redevelopment activities in the prolific oil producing spraberry field in the permian basin 
since we began our permian basin redevelopment initiative in  we have increased by approximately five fold our net acreage position in the related fields and are targeting the permian basin for continued expansion through our permian basin operation s headquarters in midland  texas 
production from the region is primarily from the spraberry  dean and wolfcamp formations at depths between  and  feet  and is heavily weighted toward long lived oil and ngls 
during  our permian basin operations produced approximately bcfe of our total production and accounted for approximately bcfe or of our total estimated proved reserves at year end 
oil and ngls accounted for of total the permian basin production for we drilled wells in the region during with a success rate 
based upon our current level of drilling activity  our drilling inventory in this area would sustain a five year drilling program 
our largest field in the permian basin by reserves is the spraberry field  where we have been active for more than years 
we operate our wells in this field and hold an average working interest 
this property consists of net developed and undeveloped acres of  and  respectively on which there were wells as of december  producing approximately bcfe net in this field is located in the spraberry trend and productive zones in the field include the spraberry  dean and wolfcamp formations 
at year end  our share of estimated proved reserves attributed to this field was bcfe  consisting of oil and natural gas 

table of contents gulf of mexico deepwater operations we have acquired and maintained a significant acreage position in the gulf of mexico deepwater 
we have successfully generated and operated deepwater exploration and development projects since as a corollary to our exploration activities  we have pioneered sophisticated deepwater development strategies employing extensive subsea tieback technologies that allow us to produce our discoveries without the expense of permanent production facilities 
as of december   we held interests in deepwater blocks and subsea wells 
these wells were tied back to host production facilities for production processing 
an additional four wells were then under development for tieback to two additional host production facilities 
although we have interests throughout the gulf of mexico  we focus much of our efforts in infrastructure dominated corridors where our subsea technology can be most efficiently deployed 
we feel our geological understanding based on exploration success in these corridors gives us a competitive advantage in assessing prospects and vying for new leases 
production in our gulf of mexico deepwater operations is largely from pleistocene to lower miocene aged formations and varies between oil and gas depending on formation and age 
during  our deepwater operation produced approximately bcfe of our total production and accounted for approximately bcfe or of our total estimated proved reserves at year end 
natural gas accounted for of total deepwater production for we drilled eight wells in the region during with a success rate 
we operate atwater valley  known as bass lite  in which in december we increased our working interest by to 
it is in the pleistocene formation and is located in approximately  feet of water 
the field consists of two development wells drilled during that are connected by a mile subsea tieback to the devil s tower spar 
production on bass lite began in february and the field produced bcfe net to our interest during the project commenced production at full capacity once the topside facilities work was completed in august at year end  our share of estimated proved reserves attributed to this field was bcfe  of which are natural gas 
we operate garden banks  known as geauxpher  in which we hold a working interest

it is located in approximately  feet of water and we have an approximate working interest in the well 
the field is being developed and first production is expected in at year end  our share of estimated proved reserves attributed to this field was bcfe  consisting of oil and natural gas 
east breaks  known as northwest nansen  is operated by anadarko petroleum corp 
the field  which is in the pliocene pleistocene formation  consists of four wells in approximately  feet of water that are connected by subsea tiebacks to the nansen spar 
we hold a working interest in the east breaks well  which was completed as a gas well  and a working interest in the three east breaks wells  which were completed as oil wells 
the field began producing in february and the field produced bcfe net to our interest during at year end  our share of estimated proved reserves attributed to the field was bcfe  consisting of oil and natural gas 
ewing bank  known as north black widow  is operated by eni petroleum us and began producing in the pliocene pleistocene formation in we hold an approximate working interest in one well  which is located in approximately  feet of water 
our share of net production during was approximately bcfe 
at year end  our share of estimated proved reserves attributed to the field was bcfe  consisting of oil and natural gas 
gulf of mexico shelf operations as an operator on the gulf of mexico shelf for a number of years  we expanded our gulf of mexico shelf operations in through our acquisition of the gulf of mexico operations of forest oil corporation 
table of contents forest and in january through our acquisition of an indirect subsidiary of statoilhydro asa that owns substantially all of its former gulf of mexico shelf assets and operations 
we increased our interests in shelf operations to blocks at year end from blocks at year end due to our operational scale and substantial lease position on the shelf  we are able to pursue a diverse array of exploration and development projects on the shelf  including numerous engineering projects designed to increase production and reserves  as well as to manage production costs through optimization of topside facilities and efficiencies of scale 
drilling prospects run the gamut from relatively small  low risk  conventional shelf projects that can be drilled from one of our numerous existing platform facilities  to high impact  deep shelf exploration prospects at depths approaching  total vertical feet 
during  our gulf of mexico shelf operation produced approximately bcfe of our total production and accounted for approximately bcfe or of our total estimated proved reserves at year end 
natural gas accounted for of total shelf production for we drilled wells in the region during with an success rate 
our largest field in the gulf of mexico shelf by reserves is vermilion at year end  estimated proved reserves attributed to this field were bcfe  consisting of approximately oil and natural gas 
during  we drilled three wells and completed one well before hurricane ike damaged the platform 
hurricane ike also interrupted the drilling of a fourth well 
remaining development involves finishing the drilling of the fourth well  drilling a fifth well and completing the remaining wells 
we anticipate that production from the five new wells will commence by third quarter the field currently has two producing wells one of which is the new well we drilled and completed in in feet of water 
these two wells produced approximately bcfe in we generated this prospect from former forest properties and hold a working interest in the newly drilled wells 
we operate vermilion  which consists of producing wells in less than feet of water

management believes that the presentation of pv values is relevant and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated proved reserves independent of our individual income tax attributes  thereby isolating the intrinsic value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to our reserves 
because many factors that are unique to each individual company affect the amount of future income taxes to be paid  the use of a pre tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies 
for these reasons  management uses  and believes the industry generally uses

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
as a result  estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as change in product prices and operating costs  may require revision of such estimates 
accordingly  oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates

table of contents title to properties substantially all of our properties currently are subject to liens securing our bank credit facility and obligations under hedging arrangements with lenders under our bank credit facility 
in addition  our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other typical burdens and encumbrances 
we do not believe that any of these burdens or encumbrances materially interfere with the use of such properties in the operation of our business 
our properties may also be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws  ordinances  rules  regulations and orders of governmental authorities 
we believe that we have performed customary investigation of  and have satisfactory title to or rights in  all of our producing properties 
as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  minimal investigation of title is made at the time of acquisition of undeveloped properties 
title investigation is made usually only before commencement of drilling operations 
we believe that title issues are less likely to arise with offshore oil and natural gas properties than with onshore properties 
competition we believe that our leasehold acreage  exploration  drilling and production capabilities  large d seismic database and technical and operational experience enable us to compete effectively 
however  our primary competitors include major integrated oil and natural gas companies  nationally owned or sponsored enterprises  and domestic independent oil and natural gas companies 
many of our larger competitors possess and employ financial and personnel resources substantially greater than those available to us 
such companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future is dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
royalty relief the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act rra  effective november   provides that all tracts in the western and central planning areas of the gulf of mexico  including whole lease blocks in the eastern planning area of the gulf of mexico lying west of degrees  minutes west longitude  in water more than meters deep and offered for bid within five years after the effective date of the rra  will be entitled to royalty relief as follows water depth royalty relief meters no royalty payable on the first million boe produced meters no royalty payable on the first million boe produced meters or deeper no royalty payable on the first million boe produced leases offered for bid within five years after the effective date of the rra are referred to as post act leases 
the rra also allows federal offshore lessees the opportunity to apply for discretionary royalty relief for new production on leases acquired before the rra was enacted  or pre act leases 
if the mms determines that new production under a pre act lease would not be economic without royalty relief  then the mms may relieve a portion of the royalty to make the project economic 
in addition to granting discretionary royalty relief  the mms has elected to include royalty relief provisions in many leases issued after november   or post leases 
for these post lease sales that have occurred to date for which the mms has elected to include royalty relief  the mms has specified the water depth categories and royalty suspension volumes applicable to production from leases issued in the sale 
in  the mms adopted additional royalty relief incentives for production of natural gas from reservoirs located deep under shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
these incentives apply to natural gas 
table of contents produced in water depths of less than meters and from deep natural gas accumulations of at least  feet of true vertical depth 
drilling of qualified wells must have started on or after march   and production must begin before may   unless the lessee obtains a one year extension 
these incentives generally apply only to production that occurs during years when the average price of natural gas on the new york mercantile exchange does not exceed the price threshold of per million btu  expressed in dollars 
in regulations published in november  the mms implemented additional royalty relief provisions to reflect statutory changes enacted in the energy policy act of the regulations provide enhanced incentives for gas production from wells of at least  feet of true vertical depth in waters of meters or less 
these regulations also expand the royalty relief incentives for natural gas produced from leases in waters to meters deep by entitling such leases to the royalty relief incentives available under the existing regulations for leases in less than meters of water  with two exceptions 
first  the incentive for production in waters to meters in depth applies to wells for which drilling began on or after may   rather than march   and that begin production before may   rather than may  second  the applicable price threshold is per million btu  expressed in dollars  rather than 
the impact of royalty relief can be significant 
effective with lease sales in  royalty rates for leases in all water depths in the gulf of mexico increased to of production 
for gulf of mexico leases awarded in lease sales  the royalty rate was of production in all water depths 
royalty relief can substantially improve the economics of projects located in deepwater or in shallow water involving deep natural gas 
many of our mms leases that are subject to royalty relief contain language that suspends royalty relief if commodity prices exceed predetermined threshold levels for a given calendar year 
as a result  royalty relief for a lease in a particular calendar year may be contingent upon average commodity prices remaining below the price threshold specified for that year 
since  commodity prices have exceeded some of the predetermined price thresholds  except in  for a number of our projects 
for the affected leases  we have been ordered by the mms to pay royalties for natural gas produced in some of those years 
however  we have challenged the mms s authority to include price thresholds in six of our post act leases awarded in and we believe that post act leases are entitled to automatic royalty relief under the rra  regardless of commodity prices  and have pursued administrative and judicial remedies in this dispute with the mms 
for more information concerning the contested royalty payments and the mms s demands  see item legal proceedings 
regulation our operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry 
many departments and agencies  both federal and state  are authorized by statute to issue  and have issued  rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual participants 
the failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these regulations than are our competitors 
transportation and sale of natural gas historically  the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of  the natural gas policy act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold 
deregulation of natural gas sales by producers began with the enactment of the natural gas policy act of in  congress enacted the natural gas wellhead decontrol act  which removed all remaining natural gas act of and natural gas policy act of price and non price controls affecting producer sales of natural gas effective january  congress could  however  re enact price controls in the future 
the ferc regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions  which affect the marketing of gas produced by us and the revenues received by us for sales of such natural gas 
the ferc requires interstate pipelines to provide open 
table of contents access transportation on a non discriminatory basis for all natural gas shippers 
the ferc frequently reviews and modifies its regulations regarding the transportation of natural gas with the stated goal of fostering competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
in addition  with respect to production onshore or in state waters  the intra state transportation of natural gas would be subject to state regulatory jurisdiction as well 
in august   congress enacted the energy policy act of  or ep act among other matters  ep act amends the natural gas act  or nga  to make it unlawful for any entity  including otherwise non jurisdictional producers such as mariner  to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the ferc  in contravention of rules prescribed by the ferc 
on january   the ferc issued regulations implementing this provision 
the regulations make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc  or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc  for any entity  directly or indirectly  to use or employ any device  scheme or artifice to defraud  to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading  or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person 
ep act also gives the ferc authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the nga up to  per day per violation 
the new anti manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non jurisdictional sales or gathering  but does apply to activities of otherwise non jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted in connection with gas sales  purchases or transportation subject to ferc jurisdiction 
it therefore reflects a significant expansion of the ferc s enforcement authority 
we do not anticipate we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to time by congress  the ferc  state regulatory bodies and the courts 
we cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become effective or their effect  if any  on our operations 
the natural gas industry historically has been closely regulated  thus  there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future 
regulation of production the production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of state and federal statutes  rules  orders and regulations 
state and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  and reports concerning operations 
texas and louisiana  the states in which we own and operate properties  have regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  the spacing of wells  and the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of related production equipment 
texas and louisiana also restrict production to the market demand for oil and natural gas and several states have indicated interests in revising applicable regulations 
these regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells  limit the number of wells  or limit the locations at which we can conduct drilling operations 
moreover  each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to production and sale of crude oil  natural gas and gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
most of our offshore operations are conducted on federal leases that are administered by the mms 
such leases require compliance with detailed mms regulations and orders pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act that are subject to interpretation and change by the mms 
among other things  we are required to obtain prior mms approval for our exploration plans and development and production plans at each lease 
mms regulations also impose construction requirements for production facilities located on federal offshore leases  as well as detailed technical requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells  and removal of platforms and other production facilities on such leases 
the mms requires lessees to post surety bonds  or provide other acceptable financial assurances  to ensure all obligations are satisfied on federal offshore leases 
the cost of these surety bonds or other financial assurances can be substantial  and there is no assurance that bonds or other financial assurances can be obtained in all cases 
we are currently in compliance with all mms financial assurance requirements 
under certain circumstances  the mms is authorized to suspend or terminate 
table of contents operations on federal offshore leases 
any suspension or termination of operations on our offshore leases could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our crude oil and gas production is subject to royalty interests established under the applicable leases 
royalty on production from state and private leases is generally governed by state law and royalty on production from leases on federal or indian lands is governed by federal law 
the mms is authorized by statute to administer royalty valuation and collection for production from federal and indian leases 
the mms generally exercises this authority through standards established under its regulations and related policies 
we do not anticipate that we will be affected by changes in federal or state law affecting royalty obligations any differently than other producers of crude oil and natural gas 
environmental and safety regulations our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state and local levels governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may  among other things require acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  and limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in certain ecologically sensitive and other protected areas 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of remedial requirements and the imposition of injunctions to force future compliance 
offshore drilling in some areas has been opposed by environmental groups and  in some areas  has been restricted 
our business and prospects could be adversely affected to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts our exploration and production activities or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
the following is a summary of some of the existing laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject spills and releases 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  and analogous state laws  impose joint and several liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner and operator of the site where the release occurred  past owners and operators of the site  and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
responsible parties under cercla may be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
additionally  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment 
in the course of our ordinary operations  we may generate waste that may fall within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
we currently own  lease or operate  and have in the past owned  leased or operated  numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas 
many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose actions with respect to the treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control 
it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under such properties  or on or under other locations where such wastes may have been taken for disposal 
these properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination  or to pay the costs of such remedial measures 
although we believe we have utilized operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry  during the course of operations 
table of contents hydrocarbons and other wastes may have been released on some of the properties we own  lease or operate 
we are not presently aware of any pending clean up obligations that could have a material impact on our operations or financial condition 
the oil pollution act opa 
the opa and regulations thereunder impose strict  joint and several liability on responsible parties for damages  including natural resource damages  resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters  adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the united states 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility and the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
the opa establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities of million  while the liability limit for offshore facilities is equal to all removal costs plus up to million in other damages 
these liability limits may not apply if a spill is caused by a party s gross negligence or willful misconduct  the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation  or if a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean up 
the opa also requires the lessee or permittee of an offshore area in which a covered offshore facility is located to provide financial assurance in the amount of million to cover liabilities related to an oil spill 
the amount of financial assurance required under the opa may be increased up to million depending on the risk represented by the quantity or quality of oil that is handled by a facility 
the failure to comply with the opa s requirements may subject a responsible party to civil  criminal  or administrative enforcement actions 
we are not aware of any action or event that would subject us to liability under the opa  and we believe that compliance with the opa s financial assurance and other operating requirements will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition 
water discharges 
the federal water pollution control act of  also known as the clean water act  imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of produced waters and other oil and gas pollutants into navigable waters 
these controls have become more stringent over the years  and it is possible that additional restrictions may be imposed in the future 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system  or npdes  program prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and gas industry into certain coastal and offshore waters 
the clean water act provides for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants  and imposes liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release 
comparable state statutes impose liabilities and authorize penalties in the case of an unauthorized discharge of petroleum or its derivatives  or other pollutants  into state waters 
in furtherance of the clean water act  the environmental protection agency epa promulgated the spill prevention  control  and countermeasure spcc regulations  which require facilities that possess certain threshold quantities of oil that could impact navigable waters or adjoining shorelines to prepare spcc plans and meet specified construction and operating standards 
the spcc regulations were revised in and required the amendment of spcc plans before february   if necessary  and required compliance with the implementation of such amended plans by august  this compliance deadline has been extended multiple times and on may  was extended until july  we have spcc plans and similar contingency plans in place at several of our facilities  and may be required to prepare such plans for additional facilities where a spill or release of oil could reach or impact jurisdictional waters of the united states 
we do not anticipate that the revisions to the spcc regulations will cause a material impact on our operations or financial condition 
air emissions 
the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources  including oil and natural gas operations 
new facilities may be required to obtain permits before operations can commence  and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
we believe that compliance with the clean air 
table of contents act and analogous state laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
in response to such studies  the us congress is actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
in addition  at least states have declined to wait for congress to develop and implement climate control legislation and have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
also  as a result of the us supreme court s decision on april  in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  the epa must consider whether it is required to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources eg  cars and trucks even if congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases 
the court s holding in massachusetts that greenhouse gases fall under the federal clean air act s definition of air pollutant may also result in future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under various clean air act programs  including those that may be used in our operations 
it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation that may be enacted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 
however  future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  demand for our operations  results of operations  and cash flows 
waste handling 
the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and analogous state and local laws and regulations govern the management of wastes  including the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes 
rcra imposes stringent operating requirements  and liability for failure to meet such requirements  on a person who is either a generator or transporter of hazardous waste or an owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment  storage or disposal facility 
rcra specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids  produced waters  and other wastes associated with the exploration  development  or production of crude oil and natural gas 
a similar exemption is contained in many of the state counterparts to rcra 
as a result  we are not required to comply with a substantial portion of rcra s requirements because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
however  these wastes may be regulated by epa or state agencies as solid waste 
in addition  ordinary industrial wastes  such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes  and waste compressor oils  may be regulated under rcra as hazardous waste 
we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes  as they are presently classified  to be significant 
however  any repeal or modification of the oil and natural gas exploration and production exemption  or modifications of similar exemptions in analogous state statutes  would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and would cause us  as well as our competitors  to incur increased operating expenses 
endangered species act 
the endangered species act  or esa  restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa 
however  the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas 
safety 
the occupational safety and health act  or osha  and other similar laws and regulations govern the protection of the health and safety of employees 
the osha hazard communication standard  epa community right to know regulations under title iii of cercla and analogous state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local governments and citizens 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements and with other applicable osha requirements 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
our employees are not represented by any labor unions 
we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike and we consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
insurance matters mariner is a member of oil insurance  ltd 
oil  an energy industry insurance cooperative  which provides our primary layer of physical damage and windstorm insurance coverage 
our coverage is subject to 
table of contents a million per occurrence deductible for our assets and a million per occurrence loss limit 
however  if a single event causes losses to all oil insured assets in excess of million  amounts covered for such losses will be reduced on a pro rata basis among oil members 
in addition to our primary coverage through oil  we also maintain commercial difference in conditions insurance that would apply with no additional deductible once our limits with oil are exhausted  as well as partial business interruption insurance covering certain of our significant producing fields and certain other fields situated in hurricane prone areas 
our business interruption coverage begins to provide benefits after a day waiting period once the designated field is shut in due to a covered event and is limited to of the forecast cash flow from each designated property 
our commercial policy expires annually on june  and is subject to a general limit of million per occurrence and in the case of named windstorms  a combined annual aggregate limit of million covering both property damage and business interruption 
in  our operations were adversely affected by hurricane ike 
the hurricane resulted in shut in and delayed production as well as facility repairs and replacement expenses 
we are evaluating the nature and extent of damage resulting from the hurricane 
with respect to hurricane ike  our oil coverage has a million per occurrence deductible and a million per occurrence limit  subject to an industry wide loss limit per occurrence of million 
to the extent that aggregate claims exceed the oil industry wide loss limit per occurrence  we expect our insurance recovery would be reduced pro rata with all other competing claims from hurricane ike and the shortfall covered by our commercial excess insurance  subject to policy limits 
applicable insurance for our hurricane katrina and rita claims with respect to the gulf of mexico assets previously acquired from forest is provided by oil 
our coverage for the former forest properties is subject to a deductible of million per occurrence and a billion industry wide loss limit per occurrence 
oil has advised us that the aggregate claims resulting from each of hurricanes katrina and rita are expected to exceed the billion per occurrence loss limit and that therefore  our insurance recovery is expected to be reduced pro rata with all other competing claims from the storms 
during  we settled our katrina and rita claims with our excess insurance providers for a one time payment of million 
the insurance coverage for mariner s legacy properties is subject to a million deductible

item a 
risk factors 
risks relating to the oil and natural gas industry and to our business the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession 
a recession or slowdown in economic activity would likely reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in lower oil and natural gas prices  which could materially adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 
in addition  the economic crisis may adversely affect our liquidity 
we may be unable to obtain adequate funding under our bank credit facility because our lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations  or because our borrowing base under the facility may be decreased as the result of a redetermination  reducing it due to lower oil or natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or 
table of contents other reasons 
if funding is not available as needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our business strategies or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile  and a decline in oil and natural gas prices would reduce our revenues  profitability and cash flow and impede our growth 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow depend substantially upon the prices and demand for oil and natural gas 
the markets for these commodities are volatile and even relatively modest drops in prices can affect significantly our financial results and impede our growth 
oil and natural gas prices increased to  and then declined significantly from  historical highs in and may fluctuate and decline significantly in the near future 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  price and quantity of foreign imports  actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other state controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls  level of consumer product demand  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  political conditions in or affecting other oil producing and natural gas producing countries  including the current conflicts in the middle east and conditions in south america and russia  weather conditions  technological advances affecting oil and natural gas consumption  overall us and global economic conditions  and price and availability of alternative fuels 
further  oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other 
to the extent that oil or natural gas comprises more than of our production or estimated proved reserves  our financial results may be more sensitive to movements in prices of that commodity 
lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis  but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item business estimated proved reserves 
in addition  we may  from time to time  enter into long term contracts based upon our reasoned expectations for commodity price levels 
if commodity prices subsequently decrease significantly for a sustained period  we may be unable to perform our obligations or otherwise breach the contract and be liable for damages 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will affect materially the quantities and present value of our reserves  which may lower our bank borrowing base and reduce our access to capital 
estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise 
it requires interpretation of the available technical data and making many assumptions about future conditions  including price and other economic conditions 
in preparing estimates we project production rates and timing of development expenditures 
we also analyze the available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
this process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of 
table of contents which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped 
if the interpretations or assumptions we use in arriving at our estimates prove to be inaccurate  the amount of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover may differ materially from the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves shown in this report 
see item business estimated proved reserves for information about our oil and gas reserves 
in estimating future net revenues from estimated proved reserves  we assume that future prices and costs are fixed and apply a fixed discount factor 
if any such assumption or the discount factor is materially inaccurate  our revenues  profitability and cash flow could be materially less than our estimates 
the present value of future net revenues from our estimated proved reserves referred to in this report is not necessarily the actual current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves on fixed prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs fluctuate over time and may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
the timing of both the production and expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor that we use to calculate the net present value of future net cash flows for reporting purposes in accordance with sec rules may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry  in general  will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor in arriving at an accurate net present value of future net cash flows 
if oil and natural gas prices decrease  we may be required to write down the carrying value and or the estimates of total reserves of our oil and natural gas properties 
accounting rules applicable to us require that we review periodically the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment 
based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews and the continuing evaluation of development plans  production data  economics and other factors  we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
a write down constitutes a non cash charge to earnings 
at december   the net capitalized cost of our proved oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limit and we recorded a non cash ceiling test impairment of million during the fourth quarter 
refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates oil and gas properties  and note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for a discussion of our use of the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties and its impact at december  we may incur other non cash charges in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
we may also reduce our estimates of the reserves that may be economically recovered  which could have the effect of reducing the value of our reserves 
we need to replace our reserves at a faster rate than companies whose reserves have longer production periods 
our failure to replace our reserves would result in decreasing reserves and production over time 
unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proven reserves  our estimated proved reserves will decline as reserves are depleted 
producing oil and natural gas reserves are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors 
high production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties during the initial few years of production 
a significant portion of our current operations are conducted in the gulf of mexico 
production from reserves in the gulf of mexico generally declines more rapidly than reserves from reservoirs in other producing regions 
as a result  our need to replace reserves from new investments is relatively greater than those of producers who produce their reserves over a longer time period  such as those producers whose reserves are located in areas where the rate of reserve production is lower 
if we are not able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves to replace our 
table of contents current and future production  our production rates will decline even if we drill the undeveloped locations that were included in our estimated proved reserves 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and income  are dependent on our success in economically finding or acquiring new reserves and efficiently developing our existing reserves 
approximately of our total estimated proved reserves are either developed non producing or undeveloped and those reserves may not ultimately be produced or developed 
as of december   approximately of our total estimated proved reserves were developed non producing and approximately were undeveloped 
these reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced 
furthermore  not all of our undeveloped or developed non producing reserves may be ultimately produced during the time periods we have planned  at the costs we have budgeted  or at all  which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
any production problems related to our gulf of mexico properties could reduce our revenue  profitability and cash flow materially 
a substantial portion of our exploration and production activities is located in the gulf of mexico 
this concentration of activity makes us more vulnerable than some other industry participants to the risks associated with the gulf of mexico  including delays and increased costs relating to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes  which are common in the gulf of mexico during certain times of the year  drilling rig and other oilfield services and compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations 
our exploration and development activities may not be commercially successful 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes  which are common in the gulf of mexico during certain times of the year  compliance with governmental regulations  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  and limitations in the market for oil and natural gas 
if any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular project  we could lose all or a part of our investment in the project  or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the project  either of which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our exploratory drilling projects are based in part on seismic data  which is costly and cannot ensure the commercial success of the project 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 
even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists and geologists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators 
d seismic data do not enable an interpreter to conclusively determine whether hydrocarbons are present or producible economically 
in addition  the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies may require greater predrilling expenditures than other drilling strategies 
because of these factors  we could incur losses as a result of exploratory drilling expenditures 
poor results from exploration activities could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows  ability to replace reserves and results of operations 

table of contents oil and gas drilling and production involve many business and operating risks  any one of which could reduce our levels of production  cause substantial losses or prevent us from realizing profits 
our business is subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas  including fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  uncontrollable flows of underground natural gas  oil and formation water  natural events and natural disasters  such as loop currents  and hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  lost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these events occurs  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of our operations and repairs to resume operations 
our offshore operations involve special risks that could increase our cost of operations and adversely affect our ability to produce oil and natural gas 
offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or leasehold acquisitions  or result in loss of equipment and properties 
exploration for oil or natural gas in the gulf of mexico deepwater generally involves greater operational and financial risks than exploration on the shelf 
deepwater drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies  involving a higher risk of technological failure and usually higher drilling costs 
moreover  deepwater projects often lack proximity to the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  necessitating significant capital investment in subsea flow line infrastructure 
subsea tieback production systems require substantial time and the use of advanced and very sophisticated installation equipment supported by remotely operated vehicles 
these operations may encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in significant cost overruns 
as a result  a significant amount of time and capital must be invested before we can market the associated oil or natural gas  increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations 
because of the lack and high cost of infrastructure  some reserve discoveries in the deepwater may never be produced economically 
see item business properties gulf of mexico deepwater operations in this annual report on form k for information about our use of tieback technology 
our hedging transactions may not protect us adequately from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and may limit future potential gains from increases in commodity prices or result in losses 
we typically enter into hedging arrangements pertaining to a substantial portion of our expected future production in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow 
these financial arrangements typically take the form of price swap contracts and costless collars 
hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including situations when the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract or production is less than 
table of contents expected 
during periods of high commodity prices  hedging arrangements may limit significantly the extent to which we can realize financial gains from such higher prices 
our hedging arrangements reduced the benefit we received from increases in oil and natural gas prices by approximately million in although we currently maintain an active hedging program  we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions in the future 
as a result  we may be affected adversely during periods of declining oil and natural gas prices 
counterparty contract default could have an adverse effect on us 
our revenues are generated under contracts with various counterparties 
results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of non performance by any of these counterparties of their contractual obligations under the various contracts 
a counterparty s default or non performance could be caused by factors beyond our control such as a counterparty experiencing credit default 
a default could occur as a result of circumstances relating directly to the counterparty  such as defaulting on its credit obligations  or due to circumstances caused by other market participants having a direct or indirect relationship with the counterparty 
defaults by counterparties may occur from time to time  and this could negatively impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
properties we acquire may not produce as projected  and we may be unable to determine reserve potential  identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities 
properties we acquire may not produce as expected  may be in an unexpected condition and may subject us to increased costs and liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
the reviews we conduct of acquired properties  prior to acquisition  are not capable of identifying all potential adverse conditions 
generally  it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition 
ordinarily  we will focus our review efforts on the higher value properties or properties with known adverse conditions and will sample the remainder 
however  even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems or permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their condition  any deficiencies  and development potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as ground water contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation or the remote location of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
in deepwater operations  the availability of a ready market depends on the proximity of  and our ability to tie into  existing production platforms owned or operated by others and the ability to negotiate commercially satisfactory arrangements with the owners or operators 
we may be required to shut in wells or delay initial production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipeline or gathering system capacity 
when that occurs  we are unable to realize revenue from those wells until the production can be tied to a gathering system 
this can result in considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil and natural gas and realization of revenues 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or personnel could affect adversely our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within budget  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
increased drilling activity periodically results in service cost increases and shortages in drilling rigs  personnel  equipment and supplies in certain areas 
shortages in availability or the high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or personnel could delay or affect adversely our exploration and development operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
increases in drilling activity in the united states or the gulf of mexico could exacerbate this situation 

table of contents competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours  giving them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel 
many of our competitors are major and large independent oil and natural gas companies and possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours 
those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
also  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
financial difficulties encountered by our farm out partners  working interest owners or third party operators could adversely affect our ability to timely complete the exploration and development of our prospects 
from time to time  we enter into farm out agreements to fund a portion of the exploration and development costs of our prospects 
moreover  other companies operate some of the other properties in which we have an ownership interest 
liquidity and cash flow problems encountered by our partners and co owners of our properties may lead to a delay in the pace of drilling or project development that may be detrimental to a project 
in addition  our farm out partners and working interest owners may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due 
in the case of a farm out partner  we may have to obtain alternative funding in order to complete the exploration and development of the prospects subject to the farm out agreement 
in the case of a working interest owner  we may be required to pay the working interest owner s share of the project costs 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the capital necessary in order to fund either of these contingencies 
we cannot control the timing or scope of drilling and development activities on properties we do not operate  and therefore we may not be in a position to control the associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
as a result  we have a limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities 
the success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that are outside of our control  including timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells and selection of technology 
compliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could affect production negatively 
exploration for and development  production and sale of oil and natural gas in the united states and the gulf of mexico are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  including environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with these environmental and other requirements 
matters subject to regulation include  among others  environmental assessment prior to development  discharge and emission permits for drilling and production operations  drilling bonds  and reports concerning operations and taxation 
under these laws and regulations  and also common law causes of action  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of pollutants and hazardous materials  remediation and clean up 
table of contents costs and other environmental damages 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with required permits may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to remedial obligations  as well as administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
we cannot predict how agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations  whether additional or more stringent laws and regulations will be adopted or the effect these interpretations and adoptions may have on our business or financial condition 
for example  the opa imposes a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills 
the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  environmental laws or regulations promulgated pursuant to the opa could have a material adverse impact on us 
further  congress or the mms could decide to limit exploratory drilling or natural gas production in additional areas of the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  any of these liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item business regulation for more information on our regulatory and environmental matters 
compliance with mms regulations could significantly delay or curtail our operations or require us to make material expenditures  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
a significant portion of our operations are located on federal oil and natural gas leases that are administered by the mms 
as an offshore operator  we must obtain mms approval for our exploration  development and production plans prior to commencing such operations 
the mms has promulgated regulations that  among other things  require us to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications  restrict the flaring or venting of natural gas  govern the plug and abandonment of wells located offshore and the installation and removal of all production facilities and govern the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases 
our insurance may not fully protect us against our business and operating risks 
we maintain insurance for some  but not all  of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business 
for some risks  we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
as a result of the losses sustained in from hurricanes katrina and rita and in from hurricane ike  as well as other factors affecting market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies  including windstorm insurance  have increased substantially 
in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
as a result  we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
although we maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice  we are not fully insured against all risks  including drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we have not yet been able to determine the full extent of our insurance recovery and the net cost to us resulting from the hurricanes 
see item business insurance matters and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for more information 
risks relating to significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions the evaluation and integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult 
we periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves  properties  prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy 
significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions may involve many risks  including diversion of our management s attention to evaluating  negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions  
table of contents challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations  information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business  our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses  operations or properties  possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations  including assumptions relating to reserves  future production  volumes  revenues  costs and synergies  difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations  and challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our business 
members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process  which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business 
if our senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process  or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process  our business could suffer 
if we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a significant acquisition  our results of operations may be lower than we expect 
the success of a significant acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities from combining the acquired assets or operations with those of ours 
even if a combination is successful  it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we may expect in estimated proved reserves  production volume  cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition or realize these benefits within the expected time frame 
anticipated benefits of an acquisition may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in commodity prices  or in oil and natural gas industry conditions  or by risks and uncertainties relating to the exploratory prospects of the combined assets or operations  or an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties 
if we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from an acquisition  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
financing and other liabilities of a significant acquisition may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or be dilutive to stockholders 
future significant acquisitions and other strategic transactions could result in our incurring additional debt  contingent liabilities and expenses  all of which could decrease our liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  an issuance of securities in connection with such transactions could dilute or lessen the rights of our current common stockholders 
risks relating to financings we will require additional capital to fund our future activities 
if we fail to obtain additional capital  we may not be able to implement fully our business plan  which could lead to a decline in reserves 
we may require financing beyond our cash flow from operations to fully execute our business plan 
historically  we have financed our business plan and operations primarily with internally generated cash flow  bank borrowings  proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties  exploration arrangements with other parties  the issuance of debt securities  privately raised equity and borrowings from affiliates 
in the future  we will require substantial capital to fund our business plan and operations 
we expect to meet our needs from one or more of our excess cash flow  debt financings and equity offerings 
sufficient capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we cannot obtain additional capital resources  we may curtail our drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms 
the issuance of additional debt would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt  thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate requirements  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other competitors 
additionally  if revenues decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices  operating difficulties or declines in reserves  our ability to obtain the capital necessary to undertake or complete future exploration and development programs and to pursue other opportunities may be limited 
this could also result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could result in a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 

table of contents we may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations 
we expect our earnings and cash flow to vary significantly from year to year due to price volatility 
as a result  the amount of debt that we can manage  in some periods  may not be appropriate for us in other periods 
additionally  our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments  including the notes 
any insufficiency could negatively impact our business 
a range of economic  competitive  business and industry factors will affect our future financial performance and  as a result  our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay our debt 
many of these factors  such as oil and natural gas prices  economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of our competitors  are beyond our control 
our debt level and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt obligations 
our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt could have important consequences for our operations  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on debt  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital  capital expenditures and other general business activities  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other activities  limiting management s discretion in operating our business  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  detracting from our ability to withstand  successfully  a downturn in our business or the economy generally  placing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors  and making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  because debt under our bank credit facility will  in some cases  vary with prevailing interest rates 
we may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances 
if we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt  it could lead to an event of default and the consequent acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt 
our ability to comply with these covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic and financial conditions 
in addition  under the terms of our bank credit facility and the indentures governing our two series of senior unsecured notes  we must comply with certain financial covenants  including current asset and total debt ratio requirements under the bank credit facility 
our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance  which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial  market and competitive factors  in particular the selling prices for our products and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy 
the breach of any of the covenants in the indentures or the bank credit facility could result in a default under the applicable agreement or a cross default under each agreement  which would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders  as the case may be  to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments 
if we are unable to repay our debt out of cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance such debt  sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering 
we cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or those future borrowings  equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
the terms of our debt  including our 
table of contents bank credit facility  may also prohibit us from taking such actions 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock  a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions  the value of our assets and our operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure that any such offerings  refinancing or sale of assets could be successfully completed

section of the rra relieves lessees of the obligation to pay royalties on certain leases until after a designated volume has been produced 
four of these leases held by mariner and two held by meri that are producing or have produced contain lease language inserted by the mms that conditions royalty relief on commodity prices remaining below specified thresholds 
since  commodity prices have exceeded some of the predetermined thresholds  except in in may and september  the mms issued orders asserting that the price thresholds had been exceeded in calendar years   and each of the years from through  and  accordingly  that royalties were due under such leases on oil and gas produced in those years 
the potential liability of meri under its leases relate to production from the leases commencing july   the effective date of mariner s acquisition of meri 
mariner and meri believe that the mms did not have the statutory authority to include commodity price threshold language in the leases governed by section of the rra and accordingly have withheld payment of royalties

business overview we are an independent oil and natural gas exploration  development and production company with principal operations in the permian basin and the gulf of mexico 
as of december   approximately of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved developed  with approximately of the total estimated proved reserves located in the permian basin  in the gulf of mexico deepwater and on the gulf of mexico shelf 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable while controlling and reducing costs 
the energy markets historically have been very volatile 
oil and natural gas prices increased to  and then declined significantly from  historical highs in and may fluctuate and decline significantly in the future 
although we attempt to mitigate the impact of price declines and provide for more predictable cash flows through our hedging strategy  a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital 
conversely  the use of derivative instruments also can prevent us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements 
the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession 
a recession or slowdown in economic activity would likely reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in lower oil and natural gas prices  which could materially adversely affect our profitability and results of operations

hurricane expenditures 
during the year ended  we incurred approximately million in hurricane expenditures resulting from hurricanes ike and gustav  of which million were repairs and were capital expenditures 
since  we have incurred approximately million in hurricane expenditures from hurricanes ike  gustav  ivan  katrina and rita  of which million were repairs  were capital expenditures and million were hurricane related abandonment costs 
net of our deductible of million and insurance proceeds received of million  our insurance receivable at december  was million  of which an estimated million is expected to be settled within the next months 
however  due to the magnitude of hurricanes ike  katrina and rita and the complexity of the insurance claims being processed by the insurance industry  the timing of our ultimate insurance recovery cannot be assured 
we expect to maintain a potentially significant insurance receivable through in respect of hurricane ike while we actively pursue settlement of our claims to minimize the impact to our working capital and liquidity 
we expect to recover substantially all of our outstanding oil claims in respect of hurricanes katrina and rita by any differences between our insurance recoveries and insurance receivables will be recorded as adjustments to our oil and natural gas properties 
sources of capital 
our primary sources of capital during were as follows cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility  and insurance proceeds 
bank credit facility we have a secured revolving credit facility with a group of banks pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement dated march   as further amended 
the credit facility matures january  and is subject to a borrowing base which is redetermined periodically 
as of december   maximum credit availability under the facility was billion  including up million in letters of credit  subject to a borrowing base of million scheduled to be redetermined in february the redetermination was pending on february   and we anticipate that it will occur in march the lenders redetermine the borrowing base periodically based upon their evaluation of our oil and gas reserves and other factors 
any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of all lenders 
the outstanding principal balance of loans under the credit facility may not exceed the borrowing base 
if the borrowing base falls below the sum of the amount borrowed and uncollateralized letter of credit exposure  
table of contents then to the extent of the deficit  we must prepay borrowings and cash collateralize letter of credit exposure  pledge additional unencumbered collateral  repay borrowings and cash collateralize letters of credit on an installment basis  or effect some combination of these actions 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at either a libor based rate or a prime based rate  at our option  plus a specified margin 
we must pay a commitment fee of to per year on unused availability under the bank credit facility 
we have used borrowings under the facility to facilitate the forest merger and acquisition of mgom  and have used and may use borrowings under the facility for general corporate purposes 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  were outstanding under the credit facility  and the interest rates were and  respectively 
in addition  as of december  five letters of credit totaling million were outstanding  of which million was required for plugging and abandonment obligations at certain of our offshore fields 
payment and performance of our obligations under the credit facility including any obligations under commodity and interest rate hedges entered into with facility lenders are secured by liens upon substantially all of our assets  and guaranteed by our subsidiaries  other than meri which is a co borrower 
we also are subject to various restrictive covenants and other usual and customary terms and conditions  including limits on additional debt  cash dividends and other restricted payments  liens  investments  asset dispositions  mergers and speculative hedging 
financial covenants under the credit facility require us to  among other things maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets plus the unused borrowing base to consolidated current liabilities of not less than to  and maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of not more than to we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the bank credit facility as of december  our breach of these covenants would be an event of default  after which the lenders could terminate their lending obligations and accelerate maturity of any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility which then would become due and payable in full 
an unrescinded acceleration of maturity under the bank credit facility would constitute an event of default under our senior notes described below  which could trigger acceleration of maturity of the indebtedness evidenced by the senior notes 
senior notes mariner has outstanding the following two issues of debt issued in registered transactions  referred to collectively as the notes million principal amount of senior notes due issued in march the notes million principal amount of senior notes due issued in april the notes the notes are senior unsecured obligations of mariner  rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness  rank equally in right of payment with each other and with mariner s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to mariner s senior secured indebtedness  including its obligations under its bank credit facility  to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness  and to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any non guarantor subsidiaries

future uses of capital 
our identified needs for liquidity in the future are as follows funding future capital expenditures  funding hurricane repairs and hurricane related abandonment operations  financing any future acquisitions that mariner may identify  paying routine operating and administrative expenses  and paying other commitments comprised largely of cash settlement of hedging obligations and debt service 
capital expenditures 
in the second half of  a world wide economic recession and oversupply of natural gas in north america led to an unprecedented decline in oil and gas prices 
however  the inflated cost of oil field services resulting from sustained historically high commodity prices did not decrease 
table of contents in line with the decline in commodity prices 
the prospect of continued low commodity prices and disproportionately high service costs has constrained the industry s capital reinvestment and undermined rates of return in new projects  particularly those in areas characterized by high costs or long reserve lives 
in order to manage our capital program within expected cash flows  we tentatively have reduced our capital budget by more than from refer to item 
business impact of worldwide financial crisis and lower commodity prices on capital program in part i of this annual report on form k for an outline of our planned activities in the permian basin and gulf of mexico 
we anticipate that our base operating capital expenditures for will be approximately million excluding hurricane related expenditures and acquisitions  with significant potential for increase or decrease depending upon drilling success and cash flow experience during the year 
approximately of the base operating capital program is planned to be allocated to development activities  to exploration activities  and the remainder to other items primarily capitalized overhead and interest 
in addition  we estimate to incur additional hurricane related costs of million during related to hurricane ike  that we believe is substantially covered under applicable insurance 
complete recovery or settlement is not expected to occur during the next months 
obligations and commitments consolidated contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands debt obligations interest obligations operating leases abandonment liabilities seismic obligations capital accrual obligations oil theoretical withdrawal rig commitment other liabilities total contractual cash commitments as of december   we incurred debt obligations under our bank credit facility  the notes 
interest obligations represent interest due on the bank credit facility and the notes at and 
future interest obligations under our bank credit facility are uncertain  due to the variable interest rate on fluctuating balances 
based on a weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility as of december   our cash payments for interest would be million annually for through and million in we accrued approximately million as of december   for an insurance premium contingency related to our membership in oil 
as part of our membership  we are obligated to pay a withdrawal premium if we elect to withdraw from oil 
we do not anticipate withdrawing from oil  however  due to the contingency  oil calculates a potential withdrawal premium annually based on past losses and we accrue a liability for the potential premium 
oil requires smaller members to provide a letter of credit or other acceptable security in favor of oil to secure payment of the withdrawal premium 
acceptable security has included a letter of credit or a security agreement pursuant to which a member grants oil a security interest in certain claim proceeds payable by oil to the member 
we anticipate that we will enter into such a security agreement  granting to oil a security interest in a portion of our hurricane ike claim proceeds payable by oil 
we expect to have the ability to replace the security agreement with a letter of credit or other acceptable security in favor of oil 

table of contents other liabilities include accrued loe of million  accrued liabilities of million  gas balancing of million  oil and gas payable of million  accrued compensation of million  other g a of million and other liabilities for million 
adequacy of capital sources and liquidity future capital resources 
our anticipated sources of liquidity in the future are as follows cash flow from operations in future periods  proceeds under our bank credit facility  proceeds from insurance policies relating to hurricane repairs  and proceeds from future capital markets transactions as needed 
in  we intend to tailor our operating capital program exclusive of hurricane related expenditures and acquisitions within our projected operating cash flow so that our operating capital requirements are largely self funding under normal commodity price assumptions 
we anticipate using proceeds under our bank credit facility only for working capital needs or acquisitions and not generally to fund our operations 
we would generally expect to fund future acquisitions on a case by case basis through a combination of bank debt and capital markets activities 
based on our current operating plan and assumed price case  our expected cash flow from operations and continued access to our bank credit facility allows us ample liquidity to conduct our operations as planned for the foreseeable future 
the timing of expenditures especially regarding deepwater projects is unpredictable 
also  our cash flows are heavily dependent on the oil and natural gas commodity markets  and our ability to hedge oil and natural gas prices 
if either oil or natural gas commodity prices decrease from their current levels  our ability to finance our planned capital expenditures could be affected negatively 
amounts available for borrowing under our bank credit facility are largely dependent on our level of estimated proved reserves and current oil and natural gas prices 
if either our estimated proved reserves or commodity prices decrease  amounts available to us to borrow under our bank credit facility could be reduced 
if our cash flows are less than anticipated or amounts available for borrowing are reduced  we may be forced to defer planned capital expenditures 
in addition  the recent worldwide financial and credit crisis may adversely affect our liquidity 
we may be unable to obtain adequate funding under our bank credit facility because our lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations  or because our borrowing base under the facility may be decreased as the result of a redetermination  reducing it due to lower oil or natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or other reasons 
if funding is not available as needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our business strategies or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
off balance sheet arrangements mariner s bank credit facility has a letter of credit subfacility of up to million that is included as a use of the borrowing base 
as of december   five such letters of credit totaling million were outstanding 
fair value measurement we determine fair value for our natural gas and crude oil costless collars using fair value measurements based on the black scholes valuation model  adjusted for credit risk 
the credit risk adjustment for collar liabilities is based on our credit quality and the credit risk adjustment for collar assets is based on the credit quality of our counterparty 
such valuations have historically approximated our exit price for such derivatives 
we validate the fair value measurements of our collars using a black scholes pricing model using observable market data  to the extent available  and unobservable or adjusted data  if observable data is not available or is not representative of fair value 
as of december   our internal calculations of fair value were determined using market data 

table of contents we determine the fair value of our natural gas and crude oil fixed price swaps by reference to forward pricing curves for natural gas and oil futures contracts 
the difference between the forward price curve and the contractual fixed price is discounted to the measurement date using a credit risk adjusted discount rate 
the credit risk adjustment for swap liabilities is based on our credit quality and the credit risk adjustment for swap assets is based on the credit quality of our counterparty 
our fair value determinations of our swaps have historically approximated our exit price for such derivatives 
due to unavailability of observable volatility data input or use of adjusted implied volatility for our collars  we have determined that fair value measurements of all of our collars are categorized as level in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas see note  fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of december  we had no collars outstanding 
we have determined that the fair value methodology described above for our swaps is consistent with observable market inputs and have categorized our swaps as level in accordance with sfas during the twelve months ended december   we recorded an asset for the increase in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments of million  principally due to the decrease in natural gas and oil commodity prices below our swap prices and floor prices in our collars 
the increase was comprised of an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million  net of income taxes of million  approximately million of unfavorable cash hedging settlements during the period reflected in natural gas and oil revenues  and an unrealized non cash loss due to hedging ineffectiveness under sfas of approximately million reflected in natural gas revenues 
we expect the continued volatility of natural gas and oil commodity prices to have a material impact on the fair value of our derivatives positions 
it is our intent to hold all of our derivatives positions to maturity such that realized gains or losses are generally recognized in income when the hedged natural gas or oil is produced and sold 
while the derivatives settlements may decrease or increase our effective price realized  the ultimate settlement of our derivatives positions is not expected to materially adversely affect our liquidity  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of mariner s financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  oil and gas properties  fair value of derivative instruments  goodwill  abandonment liabilities  income taxes  commitments and contingencies  depreciation  depletion and amortization  share based compensation  and full cost ceiling calculation 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas properties our oil and gas properties are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized  including certain g a costs 
g a costs associated with production  operations  marketing and general corporate activities are expensed as incurred 
the capitalized costs  coupled with our estimated asset retirement obligations recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  are included in the amortization base and amortized to expense using the unit of production method 
amortization is calculated based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
proceeds from the sale or disposition of oil and gas properties are applied to 
table of contents reduce net capitalized costs unless the sale or disposition causes a significant change in the relationship between costs and the estimated value of proved reserves 
capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes of proved oil and gas properties are subject to a ceiling 
the ceiling limits these costs to an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves less estimated future operating and development costs  abandonment costs net of salvage value and estimated related future income taxes 
the full cost ceiling limitation is calculated using natural gas and oil prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and is adjusted for basis or location differentials 
price is held constant over the life of the reserves 
we use derivative financial instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas to hedge against the volatility of natural gas prices 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec guidelines  we include estimated future cash flows from our hedging program in our ceiling test calculation 
if net capitalized costs related to proved properties exceed the ceiling limit  the excess is impaired and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   the net capitalized cost of proved oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling limit due to a decline in oil and gas commodity prices during the fourth quarter and the company recorded a non cash ceiling test impairment of million during the fourth quarter 
the writedown would have been million if we had not used hedge adjusted prices for the volumes that were subject to hedges 
the ceiling limit of our proved reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcfe for gas and per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials for the year ended december  if commodity prices continue to deteriorate during the first quarter of  we may be required to record a ceiling test impairment which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 
estimated proved reserves our most significant financial estimates are based on estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
estimates of proved reserves are key components in determining our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process relies on assumptions and interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by ryder scott company  lp unproved properties the costs associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development are not initially included in the full cost amortization base 
these costs relate to unproved leasehold acreage and include costs for seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination 
interest is capitalized on the costs in unproved properties while in the development stage 
unevaluated leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base once determination has been made or upon expiration of a lease 
geological and geophysical costs  including d seismic data costs  are included in the full cost amortization base as incurred when such costs cannot be associated with specific unevaluated properties for which we own a direct interest 
seismic data costs are associated with specific unevaluated properties if the seismic data is acquired for the purpose of evaluating acreage or trends covered by a leasehold interest owned by us 
we make this determination based on an analysis of leasehold and seismic maps and discussions with our chief exploration officer 
geological and geophysical costs included in unproved properties are transferred to the full cost amortization base along with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
costs of dry holes are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful 
all items included in our unevaluated property balance are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 

table of contents abandonment liability in accordance with sfas  we record the fair value of a liability for the legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which it is incurred and capitalize the corresponding cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
upon our adoption of sfas  we recorded an asset retirement obligation to reflect our legal obligations related to future plugging and abandonment of its oil and natural gas wells 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  the difference is recognized in oil and gas properties 
to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  we employ a present value technique  which reflects certain assumptions  including our credit adjusted risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 
other property other property and equipment is recorded at cost and consists of real estate  it equipment  office furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements and gas gathering systems 
acquisitions and betterments are capitalized  maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation of other property and equipment is provided on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to twenty two years 
per sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we assess other property for impairment when events indicate the carrying value exceeds fair value 
as a result of our sfas assessment performed at december   an impairment of million was recorded related to office property 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
in a purchase transaction  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired net of the fair value of liabilities assumed 
we follow the full cost method of accounting and all of our oil and gas properties are located in the united states 
for the purpose of performing an impairment test  we have determined that we have one reporting unit 
our goodwill impairment reviews consist of a two step process 
the first step is to determine the fair value of our reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the related net assets 
fair value is determined based on our estimates of market values 
if this fair value exceeds the carrying value no further analysis or goodwill write down is required 
the second step is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets 
in this step the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the underlying assets and liabilities  including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets  based on their fair values 
if necessary  goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value 
we perform our goodwill test annually on november and more often if circumstances require 
amounts recorded in goodwill relate to the excess purchase price paid in association with the forest merger 
see note acquisitions and dispositions forest gulf of mexico operation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
in connection with our annual impairment test on november   we performed a step one impairment analysis 
as a result of weakened economic conditions and a decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of  the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeded the fair value and a step two analysis was required to determine the impairment 
our fair value estimates in step two were developed using a weighted average cost of capital wacc of and a control premium of 
a increase and decrease of the wacc would have changed the fair value by and respectively 
we allocated the estimated fair value determined using these assumptions to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of our reporting unit based on their respective values 
this allocation indicated no residual value for goodwill and we recorded approximately million of goodwill impairment in continuing operations as of december  we had previously determined that there was no impairment loss in continuing operations 
table of contents as of december  and  respectively 
in  goodwill decreased as a result of changes in the book and tax basis related to the forest merger 
income taxes our provision for taxes includes both state and federal taxes 
the company records its federal income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry forwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be recovered 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from these estimates  which could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not have uncertain tax positions outstanding and  as such  did not recorded a fin liability for the years ended december  and additionally  in may  the state of texas enacted substantial changes to its tax structure beginning in by implementing a new margin tax of to be imposed on revenues less certain costs  as specified in the legislation 
derivative financial instruments the company utilizes derivative instruments in the form of natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements and costless collar arrangements in order to manage price risk associated with future crude oil and natural gas production and fixed price crude oil and natural gas purchase and sale commitments 
such agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas gains and losses resulting from these transactions  recorded at market value  are deferred and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as appropriate  until recognized as operating income in the company s consolidated statements of operations as the physical production hedged by the contracts is delivered 
the company presents the fair value of its derivatives on a net basis in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts an interpretation of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
fin 
we are required to assess the effectiveness of all our derivative contracts at inception and at every quarter end 
if open contracts cease to qualify for hedge accounting  mark to market accounting is utilized and changes in the fair value of open contracts are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
mark to market accounting may cause volatility in net income 
fair value is assessed  measured and estimated by obtaining forward commodity pricing  credit adjusted risk free interest rates and estimated volatility factors 
in addition  forward price curves and estimates of future volatility factors are used to assess and measure the effectiveness of our open contracts at the end of each period 
the fair values we report in our consolidated financial statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the net cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges are reported as oil and gas revenues and presented in cash flows from operations 
if the hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity  gains or losses are deferred and included in income in the same period as the physical production hedged by the contracts is delivered 

table of contents the conditions to be met for a derivative instrument to qualify as a cash flow hedge are the following i the item to be hedged exposes the company to price risk  ii the derivative reduces the risk exposure and is designated as a hedge at the time the derivative contract is entered into  and iii at the inception of the hedge and throughout the hedge period there is a high correlation of changes in the market value of the derivative instrument and the fair value of the underlying item being hedged 
when the designated item associated with a derivative instrument matures  is sold  extinguished or terminated  derivative gains or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale or settlement of the underlying item 
when a derivative instrument is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer expected to occur or if correlation no longer exists  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in income to the extent the future results have not been offset by the effects of price or interest rate changes on the hedged item since the inception of the hedge 
revenue recognition oil revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  and delivery has occurred and title has transferred 
natural gas and ngls revenues are recorded using the entitlement method 
under the entitlement method  revenue is recorded when title passes based on the company s net interest or nominated deliveries 
the company records its entitled share of revenues based on entitled volumes and contracted sales prices 
the sales price for natural gas  crude oil and ngls are adjusted for revenue deductions 
the revenue deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment 
subsequently  these revenue deductions are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third party documents 
historically  these adjustments have been insignificant 
since there is a ready market for natural gas  crude oil and ngls  the company sells the majority of its products soon after production at various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 
as a result  the company maintains a minimum amount of product inventory in storage 
gas imbalances occur when mariner sells more or less than its entitled ownership percentage of total gas production 
any amount received in excess overproduction of mariner s share is treated as a liability 
if mariner receives less than it is entitled  the shortage underproduction is recorded as a receivable 
imbalances are reduced either by subsequent recoupment of over and under deliveries or by cash settlement  as required by applicable contracts 
production imbalances are recorded at the lowest of i the price in effect at the time of production  ii the current market price or iii the contract price  if a contract exists 
mariner s gas imbalances are not material  as oil and natural gas volumes sold are not significantly different from its share of production share based compensation expense we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options on the grant date  which requires judgment in estimating the expected life of the option and the expected volatility of our stock 
we use a monte carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of restricted stock granted in under our stock incentive plan s long term performance based restricted stock program 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the sec issued the final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting final rule 
the final rule adopts revisions to the sec s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on forms k for years ending on or after december  early adoption of the final rule is prohibited 
the revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies 
the amendments are also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align 
table of contents them with current practices and changes in technology 
revised requirements in the sec s final rule include  but are not limited to oil and gas reserves must be reported using the average price over the prior month period  rather than year end prices  companies will be allowed to report  on an optional basis  probable and possible reserves  non traditional reserves  such as oil and gas extracted from coal and shales  will be included in the definition of oil and gas producing activities  companies will be permitted to use new technologies to determine proved reserves  as long as those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions with respect to reserve volumes  companies will be required to disclose  in narrative form  additional details on their proved undeveloped reserves puds  including the total quantity of puds at year end  any material changes to puds that occurred during the year  investments and progress made to convert puds to developed oil and gas reserves and an explanation of the reasons why material concentrations of puds in individual fields or countries have remained undeveloped for five years or more after disclosure as puds  companies will be required to report the qualifications and measures taken to assure the independence and objectivity of any business entity or employee primarily responsible for preparing or auditing the reserves estimates 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the final rule

sfas 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas achieves these improvements by requiring disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format 
it also provides more information about an entity s liquidity by requiring disclosure of derivative features that are credit risk related 
finally  it requires cross referencing within footnotes to enable financial statement users to locate important information about derivative instruments 
we currently are evaluating the effect the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value  and thereby mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas was effective for the company as of january  sfas did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as the company elected not to measure at fair value additional financial assets and liabilities not already required to be measured at fair value 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  which establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather it eliminates inconsistencies in the guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued during fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
accordingly  our adoption of 
table of contents sfas was limited to financial assets and liabilities  which primarily affects the valuation of the company s derivative contracts 
the adoption of sfas with respect to financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our net asset values see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the company is still in the process of evaluating sfas with respect to its effect on nonfinancial assets and liabilities and therefore has not yet determined the impact that it will have on its financial statements upon full adoption in nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which the company has not applied the provisions of sfas include its asset retirement obligations and assets held for future sale when applicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices and related hedging activities our major market risk exposure continues to be the prices applicable to our natural gas and oil production 
the sales price of our production is primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
historically  prices received for our natural gas and oil production have been volatile and unpredictable 
hypothetically  if production levels were to remain at levels  a increase in commodity prices from those as of december  would increase our cash flow by approximately million for the year ended december  the energy markets have historically been very volatile  and we can reasonably expect that oil and gas prices will be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
in an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of oil and natural gas on our operations  management has adopted a policy of hedging oil and natural gas prices from time to time primarily through the use of commodity price swap agreements and costless collar arrangements 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits future gains from favorable movements 
in addition  forward price curves and estimates of future volatility are used to assess and measure the ineffectiveness of our open contracts at the end of each period 
if open contracts cease to qualify for hedge accounting  the mark to market change in fair value is recognized in oil and natural gas revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
not qualifying for hedge accounting and cash flow hedge designation will cause volatility in net income 
the fair values we report in our consolidated financial statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
hedge gains and losses are recorded by commodity type in oil and natural gas revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
the effects on our oil and gas revenues from our hedging activities were as follows year ended december  in thousands cash loss gain on settlements loss gain on hedge ineffectiveness non cash gain on hedges acquired total unrealized loss gain recognized in natural gas revenue related to the ineffective portion of open contracts that are not eligible for deferral under sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  due primarily to the basis differentials between the contract price and the indexed price at the point of sale

hedges with counterparties that are lenders under our bank credit facility are secured under the bank credit facility 
as of december   the company expects to realize within the next months approximately million in net gains resulting from hedging activities that are currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these hedging gains are expected to be realized as an increase of million to oil revenues and an increase of million to natural gas revenues 
on january   the company liquidated crude oil fixed price swaps in respect of thousand barrels in exchange for a cash payment of million and installment payments of million to be received monthly throughout 
table of contents interest rates borrowings under our bank credit facility mature on january  and bear interest at either a libor based rate or a prime based rate  at our option  plus a specified margin 
both options expose us to risk of earnings loss due to changes in market rates 
we have not entered into interest rate hedges that would mitigate such risk

if the balance of our bank debt at december  were to remain constant  a increase in market interest rates would decrease our cash flow by approximately million for the year ended december
