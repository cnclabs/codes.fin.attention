during the first three quarters of  the company achieved an excellent earnings performance due to the realization of savings from the restructuring program undertaken in  increased selling prices to mitigate the effect of escalating raw materials and energy costs  the favorable effect of foreign exchange and manufacturing cost savings 
in the fourth quarter of  however  the precipitous downturn in the steel  paper  construction and automotive end markets resulted in a significant drop in demand for the company s products 
as a result  earnings per share for the fourth quarter decreased percent from the fourth quarter of and percent from the third quarter of in response to the downturn in business activity  the company established incremental procedures to generate and conserve its cash and reduce costs by suspending its stock buyback program  curtailing production through shortened work weeks  and by continuing its intensive expense control and procurement initiatives 
in addition  the company reallocated its asset portfolio in its pension plan to preserve capital and reduce exposure to market risk 
the company also implemented an additional restructuring program to reduce its workforce by approximately through both layoffs and permanent reductions 
severance related costs associated with this workforce reduction were approximately million 
worldwide net sales for were billion  a three percent increase over sales of billion 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of million  or percentage points of growth 
income from operations were million in as compared with a loss of million in the prior year 
included in income from operations in were restructuring and impairment charges of million 
included in the operating loss of the prior year were restructuring costs of million and impairment of assets charges of million 
income from continuing operations was million as compared with a loss of million in the prior year due to the restructuring charges 
income from discontinued operations was million in  due primarily to gains from the sale of four idle facilities previously written down 
in  we had a loss from discontinued operations of million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges 
net income was million as compared with a loss of million in the prior year 
the company s balance sheet at december  continues to be very strong 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  was over million 
in addition  we have available lines of credit of million  our debt to equity ratio was very low at  and our current ratio was our cashflows from operations were in excess of million in we are facing unprecedented uncertainty in the economic environment as a result of the global financial crisis 
however  as a result of the initiatives we undertook in to restructure and realign our business  and due to our strong balance sheet  the company believes it is in a strong position to manage through these difficult and uncertain times 
however  we face some significant risks and challenges in the future our global business could continue to be adversely affected by decreases in economic activity 
us steel production is at its lowest levels since the mid s at million tons per week 
housing starts are at year lows with the december annualized rate at  units and the full year rate at  units  as compared to million units in in the automotive industry  light vehicle sales were down in and in the fourth quarter of in the paper industry  production levels within the north american and european uncoated freesheet markets  our most significant market areas  continued to contract to adjust to reduced demand 
the ongoing tightening of credit in the financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers or our suppliers to obtain financing 
the uncertainty in the global economy may also continue to impact our pension costs 
changes in the fair market value of our pension assets  rates of return on assets  and discount rates could have a significant impact on our net periodic pension costs and well as our funding requirements 
our success depends in part on the performance of the industries we serve  particularly paper  steel  construction and automotive 
some of our customers may experience further consolidations and shutdowns or may face increased liquidity issues  which could deteriorate the aging of our accounts receivable  increase our bad debt exposure and possibly trigger impairment of assets 
consolidations in the paper and steel industries concentrate purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers  increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as minerals technologies inc most of our paper pcc sales are subject to long term contracts that may be terminated pursuant to their terms  or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
our filler fiber composite technology continues in development through customer trials  but has yet to be proven on a long term commercial scale 
we are subject to volatility in pricing and supply availability of our key raw materials used in our paper pcc product line and refractory product line 
our ability to recover increased costs is uncertain and may become more difficult in this economic environment 
we continue to rely on china for the majority of our supply of magnesium oxide in the refractories segment and may be subject to uncertainty in availability and cost 
the performance of our processed minerals and specialty pcc product lines are subject to fluctuations in energy costs 
as we expand our operations abroad we face the inherent risks of doing business in many foreign countries  including foreign exchange risk  import and export restrictions  and security concerns 
during the third quarter of  katahdin paper company shut down indefinitely one of its paper machines in millinocket  maine  due to increased energy costs 
the company s satellite pcc facility has also shutdown indefinitely in conjunction with the paper machine shut down 
katahdin paper company is currently evaluating the possibility of installing a biomass boiler 
if the millinocket mill does not resume operations  the company would incur an impairment of assets charge of approximately million 
the company will continue to focus on innovation and new product development and other opportunities for continued growth as follows development of the filler fiber composite program  which continues to undergo large scale paper machine trials  to increase the fill rate for uncoated freesheet paper 
increasing our sales of pcc for paper by further penetration of the markets for paper filling at both freesheet and groundwood mills  particularly in emerging markets 
further expansion of the company s pcc coating product line using the satellite model 
leverage the company s expertise in crystal engineering  especially in helping papermakers customize pcc morphologies for specific paper applications 
development of unique calcium carbonates used in the manufacture of novel biopolymers  a new market opportunity 
rapid deployment of value added formulations of refractory materials that not only reduce costs but improve performance 
continuing our penetration in emerging markets through our manufacturing facilities in china and turkey  both within the refractories segment 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these opportunities

in the fourth quarter of  production levels within the north american and european uncoated free sheet markets  our most significant market areas  continued to contract to adjust to reduced demand and inventories in reaction to the global economic crisis 
compared to the fourth quarter of last year  we saw additional machine shutdowns and paper mill closures  which could only be partially offset by increased volumes from our new facilities in thailand and brazil 
as a result  volume declines of occurred in the fourth quarter which resulted in full year paper pcc sales volumes declining by from the prior year 
volume declines partially offset increased selling prices from the pass through of raw material cost increases and foreign exchange  resulting in sales growth

net income loss dollars in millions growth growth net income loss the company recorded net income of million in as compared with a net loss of million in the loss in was attributable to impairment of assets and restructuring charges in both continuing operations and discontinued operations 
the company recorded net income of million in outlook looking forward  we remain concerned about the current state of the global economy and the impact it will have on our product lines 
us and global economic conditions worsened significantly in the last quarter of the stress caused to international credit markets  initially driven in large part by the devaluation of risky us sub prime debt  led to a dramatic tightening in liquidity 
the us and foreign governments have responded with several initiatives to alleviate the strain on the financial markets 
while these programs have had some positive effects on financial systems  credit remains tight and economic conditions in the us and globally have continued to deteriorate 
both industrial production and consumer spending have fallen sharply in the last half of as a result  we are presently experiencing weakness in all of the industries we serve paper  steel  construction and automotive 
steel production worldwide experienced steep declines in the fourth quarter of and there were several paper machine shutdowns that affected our satellite pcc product line as the paper industry continues to consolidate and rationalize capacity 
in addition  there is further deterioration in the residential and commercial construction and automotive markets  which is affecting our processed minerals product line 
there is no clear indication as to when global economic conditions will improve 
however  as a result of the realigning and restructuring of our operations in  we strengthened the basic foundation of our businesses 
therefore  we are in a better position to effectively manage through these difficult economic times 
the company initiated the following actions in response to the uncertainties in the global economy intensified monitoring and review processes around customers  suppliers and banking partners 
established additional cash conservation strategies 
suspended stock buyback program 
reallocated our pension assets to conserve value 
shortened work weeks 
significantly reduced overtime 
continued our intensive expense control initiatives 
initiated an additional restructuring program with both permanent reductions and layoffs 
in  we plan to focus on the following growth strategies continue development and potential commercial introduction of filler fiber composite technology for the paper industry to increase the fill rates of uncoated freesheet paper 
increase market penetration of pcc for paper filling at both freesheet and groundwood mills  particularly in emerging markets 
further expansion of the company s pcc coating product line using the satellite model 
emphasize higher value specialty products and application systems to increase market penetration in the refractories segment 
expand regionally into emerging markets  particularly to china and eastern europe 
development of unique calcium carbonates used in the manufacture of biopolymers  a new market opportunity 
continue to improve our cost competitiveness in all product lines 
explore selective acquisitions to complement our existing businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
as we continue to expand our operations overseas  we face the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including inflation  fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates  changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds  civil unrest  terrorism  unstable governments and legal systems and other factors 
some of our operations are located in areas that have experienced political or economic instability  including indonesia  brazil  thailand  china and south africa 
in addition  our performance depends to some extent on that of the industries we serve  particularly the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing  and construction industries 
our sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially about ten years in length  with paper companies at whose mills we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  generally in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a number of our customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to us as those currently in effect could cause our future sales growth rate to differ materially from our historical growth rate and  if not renewed  could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the pcc plant 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided from operations in were used principally to fund million of capital expenditures  to repay long term debt of million and to repurchase million of common shares for treasury 
cash provided from operating activities totaled million in as compared with million in the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in working capital and a decrease in pension funding  as compared to the prior year 
this increase primarily relates to increased inventory levels as compared with december early in  the company accelerated purchases of higher priced raw materials imported from china to avoid potential supply interruptions 
additionally  lower volumes in the fourth quarter of affected inventory balances at december  as a result  days of inventory on hand increased to days from days in the prior year 
included in cash flow from operations was pension plan funding of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result of the market decline  the company reallocated its asset portfolio in its pension plan to fixed income securities to prevent potential further declines in pension assets 
the company s pension plans are over funded  and presently there are no minimum funding requirements necessary 
the company expects its net periodic pension expense to increase significantly in as a result of a lower asset base and amortization of unrealized losses on its investment assets due to market conditions 
on october   our company s board of directors authorized the company s management  at its discretion  to repurchase up to million in additional shares over the next three year period 
the company completed this program in february and repurchased  shares under this program at an average price of approximately per share 
on october   the company s board of directors authorized the company s management to repurchase  at its discretion  up to million of additional shares over the next two year period 
as of december    shares have been repurchased under this program at an average price of a proximately per share 
on january   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock of per share 
no dividend will be payable unless declared by the board and unless funds are legally available for payment 
we have million in uncommitted short term bank credit lines  of which million was in use at december  at the present time  we have no indication that the financial institutions would be unable to commit to these lines of credit should the need arise 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for should approximate million  principally related to the construction of pcc plants and other opportunities that meet our strategic growth objectives 
we expect to meet our other long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
the aggregate maturities of long term debt are as follows million  million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
the company s debt to capital ratio is  which is well below the financial covenant ratio in its debt agreements 
the company has contingent obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of approximately million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long term assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  asset retirement obligations  income tax valuation allowances  stock based compensation  and litigation and environmental liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of our pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
there were no significant revenue adjustments in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
we have consignment arrangements with certain customers in our refractories segment 
revenues for these transactions are recorded when the consigned products are consumed by the customer 
revenues from sales of equipment are recorded upon completion of installation and receipt of customer acceptance 
revenues from services are recorded when the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses recoveries of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  we also analyze the collection history and financial condition of our other customers considering current industry conditions and determine whether an allowance needs to be established or adjusted 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation to purchase products made using those assets 
our sales of pcc are predominately pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper mills at which we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from our facility could result in an impairment of assets or accelerated depreciation at such facility 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  market capitalization below invested capital 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we principally measure any impairment by our ability to recover the carrying amount of the assets from expected future operating cash flow on a discounted basis 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  the company conducts its goodwill impairment testing in accordance with sfas for each reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter with the assistance of valuation experts 
sfas specifies a two step process for testing of goodwill impairment and measuring the magnitude of any impairment 
step one involves a developing the fair value of total invested capital of each reporting unit in which goodwill is assigned  and b comparing the fair value of total invested capital for each reporting unit to its carrying amount  to determine if there is goodwill impairment 
should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value  then the step one test is failed  and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under step two 
the step two used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the company has three reporting units  pcc  processed minerals and refractories 
the company performs its valuation utilizing two approaches to analyze and estimate value 
these are the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach incorporates the discounted cash flow method and focuses on the expected cash flow of the reporting unit 
a number of assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows  including sales volumes and prices  cost of sales  working capital  capital spending and discount rates 
we assumed minimal sales growth for our sales growth assumptions longer term ranged from to  which is consistent with our historical trends 
we also utilized a discount rate of for each reporting unit and  in addition  incorporated a company specific risk premium of to adjust for the recent economic conditions 
the market approach utilizes two methodologies  the guideline company method and the similar transactions method 
the guideline company method focuses on comparing the reporting units risk profile and growth prospects to selected similar publicly traded companies 
the similar transactions method considers prices paid in recent transactions in the reporting unit s industry or related industries 
in  the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of each respective carrying value  resulting in no impairment of goodwill 
the impairment testing involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions  changes which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions 
pension benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering the majority of employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and actuarial models which attempt to estimate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these models include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense liability recorded by us follows a one percentage point change in our major assumptions would have the following effects 
effect on expense millions of dollars discount rate salary scale return on asset increase decrease effect on projected benefit obligation millions of dollars discount rate salary scale increase decrease asset retirement obligations we currently record the obligation for estimated asset retirement costs at a fair value in the period incurred 
factors such as expected costs and expected timing of settlement can affect the fair value of the obligations 
a revision to the estimated costs or expected timing of settlement could result in an increase or decrease in the total obligation which would change the amount of amortization and accretion expense recognized in earnings over time 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
a one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
the company s accounts for stock based compensation expense under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on their date of grant 
this model is based upon assumptions relating to the volatility of the stock price  the life of the option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
of these  stock price volatility and option life require greater levels of judgment and are therefore critical accounting estimates 
we used a stock price volatility assumption based upon the historical and implied volatility of the company s stock 
we believe this is a good indicator of future  actual and implied volatilities 
for stock options granted in the period ended december   the company used a volatility assumption of 
the expected life calculation was based upon the observed and expected time to post vesting forfeiture and exercise 
for stock options granted during the fiscal year ended december   the company used a year life assumption 
the company believes the above critical estimates are based upon outcomes most likely to occur  however  were we to simultaneously increase or decrease the option life by one year and the volatility by basis points  recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately million in either direction for the year ended december  for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
prospective information and factors that may affect future results the sec encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand companies future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this report may contain forward looking statements that set our anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipates  and words and terms of similar substance  used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
we cannot guarantee that the outcomes suggested in any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and the accuracy of assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and should refer to the discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions in item a  risk factors 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on us 
however  in recent years both business segments have been affected by rapidly rising raw material and energy costs 
the company and its customers will typically negotiate reasonable price adjustments in order to recover a portion of these rapidly escalating costs 
as the contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation  there is a time lag before such price adjustments can be implemented 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of our sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and foreign currency and interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
we do not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant change in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our bank debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore our results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to such bank debt outstanding 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had open forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million of foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts mature between january and july of the fair value of these instruments at december  and december  was a liability of million and million  respectively 
in  the company entered into forward contracts to purchase million euros as a hedge of its net investment in europe 
these contracts mature in october the fair value of these instruments at december  was an asset of million
