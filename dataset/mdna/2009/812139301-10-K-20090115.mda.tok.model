item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this filing 
except where the context suggests otherwise  the terms we  us and our refer to sealy corporation and its subsidiaries 
business overview we believe we are the largest bedding manufacturer in the world  with a domestic market share of approximately in we believe our market share in is comparable to we manufacture and market a complete line of bedding innerspring and non innerspring products  including mattresses and box springs  holding leading positions in key market categories such as luxury bedding products and among leading retailers 
our conventional bedding products include the sealy  sealy posturepedic  stearns foster and bassett brands and accounted for approximately of our total domestic net sales for the year ended november  in addition to our innerspring bedding  we also produce a variety of visco elastic memory foam and latex foam bedding products 
we expect to experience continued market share growth in these product lines as we seek to strengthen our competitive position in the specialty bedding non innerspring mattress market 
we distinguish ourselves from our major competitors by maintaining our own component parts manufacturing capability and producing substantially all of our mattress innerspring and latex mattress components requirements and approximately half of our box spring component parts requirements 
the current economic and weak retail environments have affected the level of spending by end consumers and has caused a decrease in mattress sales across the industry 
from january through november  the total decrease in sales levels was as reported by the international sleep products association 
we expect this challenging business environment to continue into we have continued our focus on lean manufacturing principles which results in continuing improvements in our manufacturing processes and cost savings 
additionally  we continue to focus on new product development to bring new and innovative product to the market 
in january  we introduced our new sealy posturepedic innerspring line which is designed to eliminate tossing and turning caused by pressure points 
this product line was designed in conjunction with orthopedic surgeons  and reviewed by an independent orthopedic advisory board 
in june  we introduced a new line of specialty bedding products in the form of our sealy posturepedic purembrace mattresses featuring our proprietary smartlatex 
this product line  as with our new sealy posturepedic product  was designed to eliminate pressure points that cause tossing and turning 
we have also invested capital in the business to increase our capability to design products 
in  we opened our new center of excellence pressure mapping laboratory which allows us to use the latest technologies available to identify uncomfortable pressure points 
it also allows us to better quantify sleep quality and directly link it to sleep surfaces 
our industry continues to be challenged by the unprecedented volatility in the price of petroleum based and steel products  which affects the cost of our polyurethane foam  polyester  polyethylene foam and steel innerspring component parts 
domestic supplies of these raw materials are being limited by supplier consolidation  the exporting of these raw materials outside of the us due to the weakened dollar and other forces beyond our control 
during fiscal and  the cost of these components saw significant increases above their recent historical averages 
we expect these costs  particularly those related to steel and polyurethane and latex foams to decrease during fiscal due to an expected decline in related commodity prices  but these decreases may not occur 
the manufacturers of products such as petro chemicals and wire rod  which are the materials purchased by our suppliers of foam and drawn wire  may reduce supplies in an effort to maintain higher prices 
these actions would delay or eliminate price reductions from our suppliers 
we have continued to see sales growth in our international operations over the last several years  with our foreign subsidiaries contributing of our total revenues during fiscal however  the economic slowdown we have been experiencing in the us has begun to spread and we are experiencing a slowdown in international markets as well 
furthermore  changes in foreign exchange rates contributed favorably to international results and these trends have begun to reverse 
local currency sales declined in fiscal in canada and europe  our two largest international markets  and profits in these markets were also negatively impacted by rising raw material costs 
raw materials the cost of our steel innerspring  polyurethane foam  polyester  and polyethlylene component parts were impacted sharply by the volatility in the prices of steel and petroleum 
we expect the cost of these components to decrease from the all time highs experienced in our fiscal fourth quarter 
during fiscal  we entered into commodity based physical contracts to buy natural gas at agreed upon fixed prices 
these contracts were entered into in the normal course of business 
we do not engage in commodity hedging programs 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
us gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we choose accounting policies within us gaap that our management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
our management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
our accounting policies are stated in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item we believe the following accounting estimates are critical to understanding our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements cooperative advertising  rebate and other promotional programs we enter into agreements with our customers to provide funds to the customer for advertising and promotion of our products 
we also enter into volume and other rebate programs with our customers whereby funds may be rebated to the customer 
when sales are made to these customers  we record liabilities pursuant to these agreements 
we periodically assess these liabilities based on actual sales and claims to determine whether all of the cooperative advertising earned will be used by the customer or whether the customers will meet the requirements to receive rebate funds 
we generally negotiate these agreements on a customer by customer basis 
some of these agreements extend over several periods and are linked with supply agreements 
most of these agreements coincide with our fiscal year  however  our customers typically have ninety days following the end of a period to submit claims for reimbursement of advertising and promotional costs 
therefore  significant estimates are required at any point in time with regard to the ultimate reimbursement to be claimed by our customers 
subsequent revisions to such estimates are recorded and charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified 
costs of these programs totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
of these costs  amounts associated with volume rebates  supply agreement amortization  slotting fees  end consumer rebates and other customer allowances which were recorded as a reduction of sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the costs associated with cooperative advertising were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses and were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts during  the economic environment became more challenging and caused a higher occurrence of bankruptcies for mattress retailers 
it has also caused many of the smaller mattress retailers to exit the market 
we actively monitor the financial condition of our customers to determine the potential for any nonpayment of trade receivables 
in determining our reserve for bad debts  we also consider other general economic factors 
our management believes that our process of specific review of customers  combined with overall analytical review provides a reliable evaluation of ultimate collectibility of trade receivables 
we recorded a bad debt provision of million  or approximately percent of sales  in fiscal provisions for bad debts recorded in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
warranties and product returns our warranty policy provides a year non pro rated warranty service period on all currently manufactured sealy posturepedic  stearns foster and bassett bedding products and some other sealy branded products and a year warranty period on the major components of our trueform and mirrorform visco elastic products as well as our springfree latex product  introduced in  the last ten years of which are pro rated on a straight line basis 
in  we introduced and subsequently discontinued right touch  which has a twenty year limited warranty that covers only certain parts of the product and is pro rated for part of the twenty years 
in fiscal  we amended our warranty policy on sealy brand promotional bedding to three years for our new line introduced in january and shipped in the second quarter of fiscal the impact of the changes to the warranty policies did not have a significant impact on our financial results or position 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage at the time the sale is recorded based on historical trends of warranty costs 
we utilize warranty trends on existing similar product in order to estimate future warranty claims associated with newly introduced product 
our accrued warranty liability totaled million and million as of november  and december   respectively 
in fiscal  we completed an analysis of our returns claims experience for the us business within the americas segment based on historical return trends using new information that is available which allows us to better track and match claims received to the sales for which those claims were initially recorded 
this change in estimate resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of approximately million for fiscal as well as a corresponding reduction in the accrued returns obligation 
our estimate involves an application of the lag time in days between the sale date and the date of its return applied to the current rate of returns 
share based compensation plans we have five share based compensation plans  as described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item we have adopted the provisions of fas no 
revised share based payment fas r 
for new awards issued and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled  the cost is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant  and compensation expense is recognized for those awards earned over the service period 
certain of the equity awards vest based upon the company achieving certain ebitda performance targets 
during the service period  management estimates whether or not the ebitda performance targets will be met in order to determine the vesting period for those awards and what amount of compensation cost should be recognized related to these awards 
at the date of grant  we determine the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing formula or the trinomial lattice model  as appropriate under the circumstances 
management estimates the period of time the employee will hold the option prior to exercise and the expected volatility of sealy corporation s stock  each of which impacts the fair value of the stock options 
the fair value of restricted shares is based upon the closing price of the company s common stock as of the grant date 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for certain losses related to medical claims with excess loss coverage of  per claim per year 
the company also utilizes large deductible policies to insure claims related to general liability  product liability  automobile  and workers compensation 
our recorded liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is reviewed by us and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  medical cost inflation  or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
during fiscal  we recognized a reduction of reserves of million 
this was in part due to a continued reduction in the severity and number of claims 
also contributing to the decrease in the reserve was a prepayment of claims that was made prior to november  during fiscal  we recognized a reduction of reserves totaling million due to favorable loss development from a reduction in both the frequency and severity of historical claims experience 
during fiscal  we recognized a reduction of reserves totaling million  which included a million change in estimate due to a change from industry loss development factors to our own historical loss development factors 
the remaining change relates to favorable loss development due to a reduction in both the frequency and severity of historical claims experience 
all such charges relate to plant labor and are therefore included in cost of goods sold for the period 
impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
we assess recoverability using several methodologies  including the present value of estimated future cash flows and comparisons of multiples of enterprise values to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the analysis is based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted at rates consistent with the cost of capital specific to the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the indicated fair value of the reporting unit  a second analysis is performed to measure the fair value of all assets and liabilities 
if  based on the second analysis  it is determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  goodwill is considered impaired 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  market conditions deteriorated significantly 
this deterioration resulting from the global economic downturn had not yet matured or been considered in our annual test of goodwill 
because of the potential impact of these conditions on our projections and the indicated fair value of our reporting units  we performed an interim evaluation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of reflecting our current views regarding the impact of the changed economic environment 
this analysis indicated potential impairment in the goodwill of our europe and puerto rico reporting units 
as a result  we estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill in those reporting units compared to carrying amounts and recorded an impairment charge of million to impair goodwill of million recorded in the puerto rico reporting unit and million in the europe reporting unit 
this impairment charge is based upon estimates of the fair value of property and equipment and certain intangible assets  including customer relationships 
we will finalize these estimates in the first quarter of fiscal the expected volatility in the price of our steel and petroleum based components and the current uncertainty in the credit and equity markets may impact the estimates used in evaluating goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for potential impairment 
in light of these changes in market conditions  we will continue to monitor impairment indicators across our reporting units 
the total carrying value of our goodwill was million and million at november  and december   respectively 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings  claims  and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
a negative outcome of these matters is considered remote  and management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we record an income tax valuation allowance when the realization of certain deferred tax assets  including net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards  is not more likely than not 
these deferred tax items represent expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which may result in tax deductions in the future 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the valuation allowance and income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements 
our net deferred tax assets at november  were million  net of a million valuation allowance 
effective december   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our federal  state and foreign tax positions and in the determination of our tax provision 
despite our belief that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate  it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax matters 
we may adjust these liabilities as relevant circumstances evolve  such as guidance from the relevant tax authority  our tax advisors  or resolution of issues in the courts 
these adjustments are recognized as a component of income tax expense entirely in the period in which they are identified 
conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fas and provides additional guidance on the timing and method for the recognition and measurement of such conditional obligations 
fin became effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted fin as of the beginning of fiscal and have recorded an adjustment as of november   the first day of fiscal  of approximately million  net of income tax benefit of million  to recognize the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
in addition  we recorded million in property  plant and equipment and a liability of million in other noncurrent liabilities as of november  during fiscal  and  we recognized an additional million  million  and million  respectively  in property  plant and equipment and other noncurrent liabilities for leases entered into during the year 
we also recognized accretion expense of million during fiscal and an insignificant amount of accretion expense was recognized during fiscal these resulted from obligations in certain of our facility leases that require us to return those properties to the same or similar condition at the end of the lease as existed when we began using those facilities 
although the lease termination dates range from to  we may be able to renegotiate such leases to extend the terms 
in addition to the above obligations  we also own certain factories that contain asbestos 
current regulations require that we remove and dispose of asbestos if the factory undergoes major renovations or is demolished 
although we are not required to remove the asbestos unless renovation or demolition occurs  we are required to monitor and ensure that it remains stable and notify any potential buyer of its existence 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an asset retirement obligation of million to remove asbestos at a us facility that was renovated in the second quarter of fiscal also  in fiscal  we removed asbestos at a european facility 
we have recognized an asset retirement obligation of million for the remaining asbestos in our european facilities 
we have not recognized asset retirement obligations in our financial statements for asbestos at any other facilities because management believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for the retirement obligation as the range of time over which we may be required to remove and dispose of the asbestos is unknown or cannot be estimated 
we currently have no plans to demolish a factory or to undertake a major renovation that would require removal of the asbestos at any of these other facilities 
management will continue to monitor this issue and will record an asset retirement obligation when sufficient information becomes available to estimate the obligation 
initial public offering on april   we completed an initial public offering ipo of our common stock  raising million of net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount 
we used a portion of the proceeds to pay a cash dividend to shareholders of record immediately prior to the ipo of million 
we also used a portion of the proceeds from the ipo to repurchase and retire million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due june the notes in a series of open market transactions completed on april  at prices ranging from to of par  plus accrued interest 
on april   we used approximately million of ipo proceeds to redeem the entire outstanding balance of the senior subordinated pay in kind notes pik notes  along with accrued interest and prepayment penalties through the date of the redemption 
for a detailed presentation of the sources and uses of cash from the ipo  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included in item merger and recapitalization on april   we completed a merger with an entity owned by affiliates of kkr whereby kkr acquired approximately of our capital stock 
certain of our stockholders prior to the merger  including affiliates of bain capital  llc and others  which we refer to collectively as rollover stockholders  retained approximately an interest in our capital stock 
additionally  we refinanced our existing credit agreements in connection with this merger 
subsequently on september   sealy mattress company a owned subsidiary of the company  completed an exchange offer whereby all of the senior subordinated notes were exchanged for publicly traded  registered securities with identical terms other than certain terms relating to registration rights and certain interest rate provisions otherwise applicable to the original senior subordinated notes

the fiscal year ended december  was a week year 
year ended november  compared with year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales for the year ended november  were  million  a decrease of million  or from the year ended december  fiscal year was a week year  while fiscal year was a week year 
the decrease in net sales attributable to the rd week in fiscal was million or of fiscal net sales 
total americas net sales were  million for fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal this decrease was primarily related to our us operations within the americas segment 
total us net sales of  million for fiscal declined million from  million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the net sales attributable to the rd week in for the us were million 
the us net sales decrease of million was attributable primarily to a decrease in wholesale unit volume  partially offset by a increase in wholesale average unit selling price 
the decrease in unit volume was affected by weak retail demand  which intensified in our fiscal fourth quarter 
sales of our new posturepedic  smartlatex and sealy branded products outperformed the rest of the portfolio 
the slight increase in average unit selling price was due in part to the price increases taken in december and july average unit selling price was also favorably impacted by the million favorable impact from the change in the estimated reserve for non warranty product returns 
partially offsetting these favorable effects was the impact of increased floor sample discounts related to new product introductions as well as softer sales of higher price point products such as stearns foster 
in canada  local currency sales decreases of translated into decreases of in us dollars as retail demand in this market increasingly deteriorated during the year 
local currency sales decreases in our canadian market were driven by a decrease in unit volume  offset by a increase in average unit selling price 
the decrease in unit volume is primarily attributable to declines brought about because of a weak retail environment in this market 
elsewhere in the americas  we experienced sales gains in our mexico and argentina markets 
however  retail demand in these markets has also begun to decline 
in our europe segment  local currency sales decreases of translated into an increase of in us dollars 
local currency sales decreases in the european market were attributable to an decrease in unit volume driven by decreased sales of latex bed cores to other manufacturers  partially offset by a increase in average unit selling price associated with price increases to our customers to offset some of the increased cost of raw materials 
finished goods sales in europe decreased in local currency in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  a decrease of million compared to fiscal the results include the impact of the rd week  which represented million 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit in fiscal decreased percentage points to 
this was due to a decrease in gross profit margins within both of our segments 
total americas gross profit in fiscal decreased million to million  which as a percentage of sales  represented a decrease of percentage points to 
the decrease in gross profit for the americas segment was primarily driven by a decrease in the us gross profit in fiscal us gross profit decreased million to million or of net sales  which is a decrease of percentage points of net sales from the prior year period 
the decrease in percentage of net sales was driven primarily by higher inflation on core inputs such as steel and foam 
in addition  the domestic gross profit margin relative to the prior year was negatively impacted by less absorption of overhead expenses due to lower volume and reduced sales of higher price point products such as stearns foster 
additionally  incremental costs of approximately million were incurred in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to compliance with july federal flame retardant regulations 
the us gross profit was positively impacted by a change in accounting estimate related to our warranty returns reserves recorded in the second quarter of fiscal which resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of approximately million 
also  us gross profit was positively impacted by continued improvements in manufacturing efficiencies  particularly factory labor and product scrap costs 
the results of fiscal include million of refunds on lumber tariffs received from canadian suppliers see note of the consolidated financial statements in item as well as million more startup costs associated with the latex facility in mountain top  pennsylvania 
in canada  our gross profit margin decreased percentage points to of net sales primarily due to less absorption of overhead expenses due to lower sales volumes and rising material costs 
in our europe segment  the gross profit margin decrease resulted from manufacturing ineffiencies experienced related to lower production volume and price competition experienced in the oem business 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to million of lower volume driven variable expenses and reductions in fixed costs 
actions taken to reduce fixed costs included million of reductions in compensation related expenses  and million less promotional expenses related to more efficient launches of new products in the us as compared to fiscal in addition  spending on professional services and other discretionary items declined relative to fiscal reduced sales drove a reduction of million in volume variable expenses comprised of a million decrease in cooperative advertising costs partially offset by higher transportation costs  a million increase in bad debt costs and the impact of significantly higher foreign currency valuations relative to the us dollar 
the fixed cost reductions were partially offset by million of costs associated with a reduction in personnel and executive search costs 
the selling  general and administrative expense recorded in fiscal also reflected the gain on the sale of our orlando facility of million as well as million of costs associated with an organizational realignment 
goodwill impairment loss 
during fiscal  we recognized a total non cash charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill of our puerto rico and europe reporting units 
the impairment was indicated by an update to our fiscal annual impairment testing of goodwill performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the goodwill impairment reflected an estimated reduction in the fair value of puerto rico and europe as a result of lower expected cash flows for the business and represents the entire goodwill balances for those reporting units 
we will complete our analysis of these fair values in the first quarter of fiscal and reflect any change in the estimate at that time  if necessary 
no such impairments were identified in fiscal restructuring and related costs 
we recognized pretax restructuring costs of million during the year ended november  no such costs were recognized during the year ended december  these charges primarily relate to the following actions in the first quarter of fiscal  management made the decision to cut back the manufacturing operations in brazil and move to a business model under which significantly more product will be supplied by production from other sealy manufacturing facilities 
as a result  the company incurred charges of million related to employee severance and related benefits 
the company does not expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to this activity 
the plan was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  management elected to close its administrative offices near milan  italy and relocate these activities to its manufacturing facility in silvano  italy 
this closure resulted in the elimination of approximately employees who elected not to relocate in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge related to this action of million during the year ended november   the majority of which related to employee severance and benefits 
an insignificant amount of this charge was related to relocation costs 
this plan was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  management also made the decision to close its manufacturing facility in clarion  pennsylvania 
this facility was closed on october  this closure resulted in the elimination of approximately positions  the majority of which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a pre tax restructuring and impairment charge related to this action of million during fiscal  of which million was related to employee severance and benefits and other exit costs  and million of which was non cash in nature  related to fixed asset impairment charges 
the impairment charges were recognized based on the difference between the carrying value and the amount expected to be recovered through sale of the property  plant and equipment 
the company expects to incur additional restructuring charges related to this activity of approximately million to million  principally in the form of relocation costs  which are expected to be recorded in first quarter of fiscal  after which time the plan should be complete 
royalty income  net of royalty expense 
our consolidated royalty income  net of royalty expense  for fiscal decreased million to million from fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in international licensee sales 
interest expense 
our consolidated interest expense in fiscal decreased million from fiscal our weighted average borrowing costs for fiscal and were and  respectively 
our borrowing cost and the related interest expense decreased because of lower interest rates on the unhedged variable rate component of our floating rate debt offset partially by an increase in the outstanding amount on our revolving credit facility 
the borrowing cost was also reduced because of the retirement of million of our notes late in fiscal debt extinguishment and refinancing expenses 
during fiscal  we incurred cash charges of million related to the amendment of our senior credit facility which represents amounts paid to the creditors in connection with the amendment 
during fiscal  we incurred million of debt extinguishment costs consisting of million of non cash charges offset by a million gain related to the retirement of million of our notes 
income tax 
our effective income tax rate generally differs from the federal statutory rate due to the effects of certain foreign tax rate differentials and state and local income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the effective rate for the fiscal period was increased by due to lower pre tax income and the impairment of goodwill for our puerto rico and europe reporting units which is not tax deductible 
the effective rate for the fiscal period was reduced by a benefit of approximately million resulting from a reduction in our income tax reserve as a result of the elimination of certain federal and state tax exposures due to the expiration of statutes of limitations and approximately million from the reduction of the valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards due to the availability of capital gains  and the reversal of previously established valuation allowances for mexican deferred tax assets  partially offset by valuation allowances established during the year 
year ended december  compared with year ended november  net sales 
our consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were  million  an increase of million  or from the year ended november  fiscal year was a week year  while fiscal year was a week year 
the increase in net sales attributable to the rd week was million 
total americas net sales were  million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase was primarily related to our us and canadian operations within the americas segment 
total us net sales were  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal in response to the challenging market conditions in the us bedding industry and increased competition in the luxury portion of the market  our focus has been on driving unit volume 
by driving unit volume  we were able to maintain the number of slots on the floors of our retail customers 
we believe that by maintaining these slots  we are in a better position to take advantage of any improvement in industry conditions  and more importantly  insure that we will have sufficient distribution points for new products 
this strategy drove a us net sales increase of million which was attributable to an increase in unit volume  partially offset by a decrease in average unit selling price 
the increase in unit volume is primarily attributable to the strong performance of our sealy brand promotional product sales  which were up from the prior year period  and growth of our specialty bedding product sales  which increased over the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in our average unit selling price is primarily due to the higher volume of lower priced mattresses  such as our sealy brand promotional products and lower sales of higher priced luxury innerspring products 
in addition  strategic pricing actions were taken on selected products such as the stearns foster and trueform lines to drive unit volume 
in canada  local currency sales gains of translated into gains of in us dollars 
local currency sales gains in our canadian market were driven by a increase in unit volume  combined with a decrease in average unit selling price 
the changes in unit volume and average unit selling price were the result of selective pricing actions and promotional activity with national accounts 
elsewhere in the americas  we experienced sales gains in our mexico and argentina markets 
in our europe segment  local currency sales gains of translated into an increase of in us dollars 
local currency sales gains in the european market were attributable to a increase in unit volume driven by increased sales of latex bed cores to other manufacturers  combined with a decrease in average unit selling price associated with the increased sales of lower priced latex bed cores 
finished goods sales in europe increased in local currency or in us dollars in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million compared to fiscal the results include the impact of the rd week  which represented million 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased percentage points to 
this was due primarily to a decrease in our us and canada gross profit margins within our americas segment 
total americas gross profit increased million to million  which as a percentage of sales  represented a decrease of percentage points to 
us gross profit decreased million to million or of net sales  which is a decrease of percentage points of net sales from the prior year period 
this decrease in percentage of net sales was driven by the addition of million of flame retardant materials to our products  the change in product mix and strategic pricing actions mentioned above and million of start up costs associated with the new latex facility in mountain top  pennsylvania 
in addition  results included a million favorable adjustment due to changes in estimates underlying the reserves for workers compensation claims in and prior years 
partially offsetting these effects were continued improvements in our manufacturing efficiencies  lower employee health insurance costs arising from our transition to a new third party administrator  as well as million of refunds on lumber tariffs received from canadian suppliers see note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
on a per unit basis  us material costs increased over the prior year due primarily to additional costs to make our products compliant with the federal flame retardancy regulations  partially offset by improved yield on raw materials 
in canada  our gross profit margin decreased percentage points to of net sales primarily due to pricing actions taken that reduced average unit selling prices 
in our europe segment  the gross profit margin decrease resulted from increased sales of lower priced latex bed cores to other manufacturers  which carry a lower unit price and gross margin 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and november  this increase as a percent of sales is primarily due to million of volume driven variable expenses  including a million increase in cooperative advertising costs and a million increase in delivery costs due primarily to higher unit volume 
other cost increases included a million increase in promotional expenses in the us operations associated with the roll out of our new posturepedic reserve products and stearns foster product line and other promotional expenses  a million increase in spending on national advertising and million of costs associated with an organizational realignment in the us this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in compensation and other sales and administration costs in addition to a gain on the sale of our orlando facility of million 
expenses associated with ipo 
during fiscal  we incurred million of expenses directly related to the ipo  which included approximately million of transaction related bonuses paid to management employees and million paid to kkr for the termination of the management services agreement  and million in expenses related to debt retirement and non cash compensation 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
royalty income  net of royalty expense 
our consolidated royalty income  net of royalty expense  for fiscal decreased million to million from fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in international royalty revenue 
interest expense 
our consolidated interest expense in fiscal decreased million from fiscal  primarily due to lower debt levels resulting from million in voluntary prepayments of our senior term debt since november   the retirement of million of pik notes and million of the notes in the second quarter of fiscal using proceeds from the ipo as well as the retirement of million of the notes in fiscal these reductions were partially offset by slightly higher borrowing costs 
our weighted average borrowing costs for fiscal and were and  respectively 
debt extinguishment and refinancing expenses 
during fiscal  we incurred million of debt extinguishment costs consisting of million of non cash charges offset by a million gain relating to the retirement of million of our notes 
during fiscal  we incurred million of debt extinguishment costs consisting of million of cash expenses and million of non cash charges related to the extinguishment of debt retired using proceeds from the ipo as well as million of cash expenses and million of non cash charges related to the refinancing of our senior term debt in august  income tax 
our effective income tax rate generally differs from the federal statutory rate due to the effects of certain foreign tax rate differentials and state and local income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
the effective rate for the fiscal period was reduced by a benefit of approximately million resulting from a reduction in our income tax reserve as a result of the elimination of certain federal and state tax exposures due to the expiration of statutes of limitations and approximately million from the reduction of the valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards due to the availability of capital gains  and the reversal of previously established valuation allowances for mexican deferred tax assets  partially offset by valuation allowances established during the year 
the effective rate for the fiscal period was reduced by a benefit of approximately million resulting from a reduction in our income tax reserve as a result of the elimination of certain federal and state tax exposures and approximately million from the reduction of the valuation allowance on capital loss carryforwards due to the availability of capital gains 
liquidity and capital resources principal sources of funds our principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
our principal uses of funds consist of operating expenditures  payments of principal and interest on our senior credit agreements  capital expenditures  and interest payments on our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
capital expenditures totaled million for the year ended november  and we expect the level of capital expenditures to reduce significantly in fiscal during fiscal  there was no significant spending for additional production capacity 
we believe that annual capital expenditure limitations in our current credit agreements will not prevent us from meeting our ongoing capital needs 
our introductions of new products typically require us to make initial cash investments in inventory  promotional supplies and employee training which may not be immediately recovered through new product sales 
however  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb such expenditures related to new products and that these expenses will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating cash flow 
at november   we had approximately million available under our revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to mature in  after taking into account letters of credit issued totaling million 
our net weighted average borrowing cost was and for the years ended november  and december   respectively 
due to concern over our ability to remain in compliance with our maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios under our senior credit facility  we entered into the second amendment to the third amended and restated credit agreement on november  this amendment loosened the restrictions provided by these ratios in the near term 
these ratios are currently times for the maximum leverage ratio and for the minimum interest coverage ratio and become more restrictive over time under the amended agreement and reduce to times for the maximum leverage ratio and increase to times for the minimum interest coverage ratio by june in connection with the amendment  we paid an amendment fee to the lenders of million which represents basis points on the outstanding balance under the senior credit facility as well as an arrangement fee of approximately million 
additionally  the amendment had the effect of significantly increasing the applicable margin rates for our senior secured term loans by to basis points and by basis points for our senior revolving credit facility 
given the significant amount of debt outstanding under the senior credit facility  the increased interest rates will have a significant impact on our required interest payments to be made in future periods 
however  we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity provided by operating cash flow to be able to satisfy the level of debt service requirements as revised by this amendment 
based on our ability to amend the secured credit facility as discussed above and our periodic borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility during fiscal for amounts above the amounts required to fund operations in order to ensure the availability of funds under the agreement  we believe that we will be able to obtain additional funds as necessary under this arrangement during fiscal in order to support our operations 
as a result of the ipo completed april   approximately million of the net proceeds were used to retire the senior subordinated pik notes including accrued interest and prepayment penalties thereon  and approximately million was used to repurchase and retire million of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under our notes along with accrued interest and market premiums thereon 
we also retired million of our notes during fiscal since august   the date of the third amended and restated credit agreement  we have repaid million of the outstanding balance of the term loans  including million of payments made in fiscal debt we have incurred debt  including senior credit facilities consisting of a million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in april and senior secured term loan facilities maturing in august and august outstanding balances on these senior facilities were million at november  we also have an outstanding principal balance of million at november  on our notes 
on august   we amended our senior secured credit agreement to provide for two senior secured term loans  one for million maturing august  and one for million maturing august  as indicated above  we amended our senior secured credit agreement in fiscal to make the financial leverage and interest coverage ratios less restrictive 
the amendment also increased the applicable interest rate margins charged on the senior secured term loans and senior revolving credit facility  by basis points on the million term loan  basis points on the million term loan and basis points on the senior revolving credit facility 
in addition  this amendment also increased the percentage of excess cash flow that is required to be used to prepay loans beginning with the fiscal year 
the total amount of million available under our senior revolving credit facility was unchanged by the amendment 
however  certain amendments were made to the availability of these funds through the swing line provisions of the agreement 
in connection with the amendment  we incurred a charge of million during the fourth fiscal quarter of for fees and expenses related to the amendment 
since august  we have repaid million of the original million outstanding on our term loan maturing august  and million of the original million outstanding on our term loan maturing august  future principal debt payments are expected to be paid out of cash flows from operations and borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
as of january   we have million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the new senior secured credit facilities bear interest at our choice of the eurodollar rate or adjusted base rate abr  in each case  plus an applicable margin of for eurodollar loans and for abr loans 
as amended  beginning in fiscal  we may be required to make principal prepayments that are equal to of excess cash flow for the preceding fiscal year  as defined in our senior secured credit agreement  reducing to if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to to 
we do not expect there to be any mandatory prepayments due in fiscal on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective december  fixing the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of the outstanding balance under the senior secured term loan through november  declining to million from december through november  and further declining to million from december through november we will select the eurodollar rate on the hedged portion of the senior secured term loan during the term of the swap 
additionally  we entered into three interest rate swaps for million euro  million euro  and million euro which fix the floating interest rate on the debt of our europe segment at   and  respectively 
the notional amounts of these contracts amortize over the life of the agreement and the agreements expire in may  january and october we have not formally documented these interest rate swaps as hedges 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of interest expense 
subsequent to year end  on december   the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements effective december  the first of these swaps fixes the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of the outstanding balance under the senior credit facility through november  the second of these swaps fixes the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of the outstanding balance under the senior credit facility through february  the company will select the eurodollar rate on the hedged portion of the senior credit facility during the term of these swaps 
the outstanding notes  which are publicly traded  registered securities  consist of million aggregate principal amount maturing june   bearing interest at per annum payable semiannually in arrears on june and december  commencing on december  during the second quarter of fiscal  we used a portion of the proceeds from the ipo to retire approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we retired an additional million and million  respectively  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
there were no retirements of the notes in fiscal at november  we were in compliance with the covenants contained within our senior credit agreements and indenture governing the notes 
as part of our ongoing evaluation of our capital structure  we continually assess opportunities to reduce our debt  which opportunities may from time to time include voluntary prepayments of our senior secured term debt  or redemption or repurchase of a portion of our senior subordinated notes to the extent permitted by our debt covenants 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made a voluntary prepayment on its tranche a term loan of million 
this prepayment was allocated to the mandatory principal payments under tranche a due in february  may and august of in addition  our board authorized a common stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our company s stock 
our ability to repurchase common stock under this program is restricted by the company s third amended and restated credit agreement as amended 
as of november   we had repurchased million under this program  of which none was repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal from december  through january   there were no repurchases of shares under this program 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay the interest on or to refinance our indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon the current level of operations and our current expectations for future periods in light of the current economic environment  we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under the senior credit agreement  will be adequate to meet the future liquidity needs during the one year following november  we will be required to make scheduled principal payments of approximately million during the next twelve months  with million for our senior secured term loans  million for our financing obligations and capital leases and the remainder for debt owed by our international subsidiaries 
however  as we continually evaluate our ability to make additional prepayments as permitted under our senior credit agreements  it is possible that we will make additional voluntary prepayments on our senior debt during that time to the extent permitted by our debt covenants 
while we believe that we will have the necessary liquidity through our operating cash flow and revolving credit facility for the next year to fund our debt service requirements  capital expenditures and other operational cash requirements  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  realize anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements or obtain future borrowings under the senior credit agreements in an amount sufficient to enable us to do so 
in addition  we rely on the revolving credit facility to provide a significant portion of our operational cash flow needs and debt service requirements 
while this facility remains in place through april  we expect there will be a need to refinance this debt upon its maturity 
additionally  the senior and subordinated debt mature in the following years through  and we will likely be required to refinance this debt as it matures 
we may not be able to affect any future refinancing of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
dividend during fiscal  the company paid out dividends totaling million 
the company announced on april  that its board of directors voted to suspend the company s quarterly dividend 
this decision is intended to increase our financial flexibility and will enable it to better allocate its capital in order to enhance shareholder returns over time 
our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends such as meeting a minimum leverage ratio 
we currently do not meet this requirement 
therefore  we do not currently expect a dividend will be declared during the first fiscal quarter of cash flow analysis the following table summarizes our changes in cash fiscal year in thousands statement of cash flow data cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effect of exchange rate changes on cash   change in cash and cash equivalents    cash and cash equivalents beginning of period    end of period    we use a week fiscal year ending on the closest sunday to november  but no later than december the fiscal years ended november  and november  were week years 
the fiscal year ended december  was a week year 
year ended november  compared with year ended december  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations decreased million to a million net source of cash for the year ended november   compared to a million net source of cash for the year ended december  this decrease has been primarily driven by a reduction in net income from fiscal of million 
this decrease has been partially offset by changes in working capital driven primarily by a reduction in accounts receivable balances 
cash flows used in investing activities 
our cash flows used in investing activities decreased approximately million from fiscal primarily due to million lower capital expenditures for fiscal as compared with the prior fiscal year 
the decreased capital expenditures were primarily due to the completion of our new facility in orlando  florida  the completion of the mountain top  pennsylvania facility and the commencement of work on a second production line at the same facility and the construction of a warehouse at our production site in italy in fiscal these expenditures were partially offset by million lower proceeds on sales of assets 
fiscal results included million received from the sale of our orlando  florida facility 
cash flows used in financing activities 
our cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended november  decreased million to a net use of million from a net use of million for the year ended december  this decrease has been driven by million less of dividend payments and million less net borrowings against our senior revolving credit facility in fiscal further  in fiscal  million was used to repurchase our common stock  million was used to retire a portion of our notes and million was used for payments on our senior secured term loans 
year ended december  compared with year ended november  cash flows from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations increased million to a million net source of cash for the year ended december   compared to a million net source of cash for the year ended november  contributing to this increase was the inclusion of approximately million of expenses in net income and interest payments associated with the ipo and related debt extinguishments in the prior year  with the remaining increase primarily the result of changes in working capital and timing of various vendor payments 
cash flows from investing activities 
our cash flows used in investing activities increased approximately million from fiscal primarily due to million higher capital expenditures for fiscal as compared with the prior fiscal year 
the increased capital expenditures were primarily due to the completion of our new facility in orlando  florida  the completion of the mountain top  pennsylvania facility and the commencement of work on a second production line at the same facility and the construction of a warehouse at our production site in italy 
these expenditures were partially offset by million higher proceeds on sales of assets  including million received from the sale of our orlando  florida facility 
cash flows from financing activities 
our cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december  increased million to a net use of million from a net use of million for the year ended november  this increase has been primarily driven by million used to repurchase our common stock  the retirement of million of our notes and million of payments on our senior secured term loans in fiscal these uses have been partially offset by an increase in the net borrowings against our outstanding senior revolving credit facility of million in fiscal in fiscal  we received million of ipo proceeds which were used to make a million dividend payment and to retire million of debt 
debt covenants our long term obligations contain various financial tests and covenants 
the senior secured credit facilities require us to meet a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
the indenture governing the notes also requires us to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio in order to incur additional indebtedness  subject to certain exceptions 
we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants 
the specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements  each of which we have previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
as of november  our calculated maximum leverage ratio was times compared with a requirement of times and our minimum interest coverage ratio was times compared with a requirement of times 
certain covenants contained in the senior secured credit facilities and notes are based on what we refer to herein as adjusted ebitda 
in those agreements  ebitda is defined as net income plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance as discussed above 
adjusted ebitda is presented herein as it is a material component of these covenants 
for instance  the indenture governing the notes and the agreement governing sealy mattress company s senior secured credit facilities each contain financial covenant ratios  specifically leverage and interest coverage ratios  that are calculated by reference to adjusted ebitda 
non compliance with the financial ratio maintenance covenants contained in sealy mattress company s senior secured credit facilities could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under such facilities  while non compliance with the debt incurrence ratios contained in the indenture governing the notes would prohibit sealy mattress company and its subsidiaries from being able to incur additional indebtedness other than pursuant to specified exceptions 
in addition  under the restricted payment covenants contained in the indenture governing the notes  the ability of sealy mattress company to pay dividends is restricted by formula based on the amount of adjusted ebitda 
while the determination of unusual items is subject to interpretation and requires judgment  we believe the adjustments listed below are in accordance with the covenants discussed above and are pursuant to the terms of the debt agreement or approval of the debtors 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  they are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
because not all companies use identical calculations  these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net loss to ebitda and ebitda to adjusted ebitda for the year ended november  in thousands net loss interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda unusual and nonrecurring losses goodwill impairment debt refinancing costs executive severance non cash compensation restructuring related costs non executive severance other various a adjusted ebitda a consists of various immaterial adjustments

off balance sheet arrangements we occupy premises and utilize equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the obligations under those leases are not recorded on our balance sheet 
many of these leases provide for payment of certain expenses and contain renewal and purchase options 
during the fiscal years ended november   december  and november   we recognized lease expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
we are involved in a joint venture to develop markets for sealy branded products in asia 
the joint venture is not considered to be a variable interest entity and is therefore not consolidated for financial statement purposes 
we account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method  and our net investment of million is recorded as a component of debt issuance costs  net  and other assets within the consolidated balance sheet at november  we believe that any possible commitments arising from this joint venture will not be significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as previously discussed  our debt at november  consists of million outstanding under a million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in  million outstanding under a senior secured term loan facility maturing in  million outstanding under a senior secured term loan facility maturing in  million outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  million due on our financing obligations and an additional million of other borrowings  most of which are owed by our international subsidiaries 
we engage in various hedging activities in order to mitigate the risk of variability in future cash flows resulting from floating interest rates on our debt and projected foreign currency purchase requirements 
accordingly  we have entered into contractual arrangements for interest rate swaps and forward purchases of foreign currency 
the related assets and liabilities associated with the fair value of such derivative instruments are recorded on our balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in our income statement  except for those associated with those agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s federal  state and foreign tax positions and in the determination of its tax provision 
despite the company s belief that its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate  it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter 
the company may adjust these liabilities as relevant circumstances evolve  such as guidance from the relevant tax authority  or resolution of issues in the courts 
these adjustments are recognized as a component of income tax expense entirely in the period in which they are identified 
while the company is currently undergoing examinations of certain of its corporate income tax returns by tax authorities  no issues related to these reserves have been presented to the company and the company has not been informed that such audits will result in an assessment or payment of taxes related to these positions during the one year period following november  we adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective december  as of the date of the adoption  our reserve for uncertain tax positions including penalties and interest was million 
at november   the entire reserve for uncertain tax positions of million including penalties and interest of which million is classified as a noncurrent asset and million is classified as a noncurrent liability 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
as such  the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities are not included in the table below 
our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of november  are summarized below in thousands contractual obligations after total obligations principal maturities of long term debt projected interest on long term debt projected cash flows on derivatives operating leases obligations under license agreements purchase commitments related to capital expenditures total other commercial commitments after total commitments standby letters of credit million of our outstanding debt at november  is subject to variable interest rates 
interest payments are projected based on rates in effect at november  assuming no variable rate fluctuations going forward 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements that were entered into on december  which converted another million of variable rate debt to a fixed interest rate  an increase in the interest rates applicable to the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt by would result in approximately million in additional annual cash interest expense 
net cash payments on our hedging instruments consist of the projected net settlements of our interest rate swap as of november  based on the projected interest rates used to value the swap on that date 
in addition  we entered into two additional interest rate swaps on december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
obligations under operating leases include only projected payments under current lease terms  excluding renewal options and assuming no exercise of any purchase options 
amounts represent minimum guarantees owed under license agreements 
we have made firm purchase commitments of approximately million as of november  related to the purchase of equipment related to a new product line 
we issue letters of credit in the ordinary course of business primarily to back our various obligations under workers compensation and other insurance programs  environmental liabilities  and open positions on certain of our derivative instruments 
these obligations will renew automatically on an annual basis unless cancelled per our instructions 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  we have a million long term obligation arising from underfunded pension plans 
future minimum pension funding requirements are not included in the schedule above as they are not available for all periods presented 
during fiscal  we estimate that we will make approximately million in contributions to the plans 
in fiscal  we contributed million into the plans 
the increase in the funding requirements between years has been driven  in part  by the underperformance of the plan assets during fiscal due to the slowdown of the overall global economy 
only agreements to purchase goods or services with fixed or minimum obligations are included in the schedule above 
it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business

foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries in which we manufacture or sell our products would result in a change of approximately million in our earnings 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from purchases in a foreign currency  we have instituted a forecasted cash flow hedging program 
we hedge portions of our purchases denominated in foreign currencies and royalty payments to third parties with forward contracts 
at november   we had five forward foreign currency contracts outstanding to purchase a total of million euros with expiration dates ranging from december  through december  at november   the fair value of these contracts was a liability of an insignificant amount 
the changes in fair value of the foreign currency hedges are included in net income  except for those contracts that have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
for contracts designated as hedges for accounting purposes  the changes in fair value related to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized as a component of comprehensive income 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt 
to manage this risk  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to convert certain variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as of november   we had an outstanding interest rate swap agreement effective december  that fixes the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of the outstanding balance under the senior secured term loan through november  declining to million from december through november  and further declining to million from december through november the fair value of this swap instrument was a liability of million at november  additionally  we entered into three interest rate swaps for million euro  million euro  and million euro which fix the floating interest rate on the debt of our europe segment at   and  respectively 
the notional amounts of these contracts amortize over the life of the agreement and the agreements expire in may  january and october we have not formally documented these interest rate swaps as hedges 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of interest expense 
the fair value of these swap instruments was an asset of million at november  subsequent to year end  on december   the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements effective december  the first of these swaps fixes the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of the outstanding balance under the senior credit facility through november  the second of these swaps fixes the floating portion of the interest rate at on million of the outstanding balance under the senior credit facility through february  a increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our interest rate derivative instrument would not have a material impact on our earnings during the next fiscal year 
based on the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt outstanding at november   a basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates would have an approximately million dollar impact on our annual interest expense 
this is before giving effect to the two new interest rate swap agreements that were entered into on december  for a combined notional amount of million 
commodity price risks the cost of our steel innerspring  polyurethane foam  polyester and polyethylene component parts are impacted by the unprecedented volatility in the price of steel and petroleum 
we expect the cost of these components to decrease at least initially in fiscal due to an expected decline in related commodity prices 
during fiscal  we entered into commodity based physical contracts to buy natural gas at agreed upon fixed prices 
these contracts were entered into in the normal course of business 
we do not engage in commodity hedging programs
