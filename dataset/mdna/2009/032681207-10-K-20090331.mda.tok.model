item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed under forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including the risk factors described in item a 
our business we are an it services company that is focused on providing configured solutions for our clients 
we provide it staffing and project based services  including application development and integration  systems integration  portals and collaboration solutions  network and infrastructure solutions  and managed services 
the demand for our services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and locations that we serve 
the pace of technological change and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for our services 
competition for new engagements and pricing pressure has been strong 
during the second half of  we noticed a decrease in the demand for our services  primarily in our high volume it staffing clients and our value added reseller business 
we also have noticed that our solutions related projects have longer sales cycles and are being deferred by our clients 
we anticipate this weakness in market demand to continue for most of if not all of we are determined to become a more focused it professional services organization 
we are intentionally eliminating or divesting non strategic  non core service offerings and lines of business 
in  we intend to operate as a smaller enterprise that is focused on returning to operating profitability 
we continue to execute on our plan which we believe will allow us to emerge from the current economic downturn as a stronger  more institutionally mature business that can serve as a platform for future growth 
the success of our business depends primarily on the volume of assignments and projects we secure  the bill and contract rates for those assignments and projects  the costs of the consultants that provide the services and the quality and efficiency of our sales  recruiting and administrative functions 
we are also dependent on the client demand for infrastructure solutions which impacts our value added reseller business and acceptable pricing and terms from our channel partners 
our extensive network of qualified it professionals  our over years of it industry experience  our recruiting process  our ability to deliver on demand  our value added technology industry partnerships and our overall commitment to quality are factors that we believe are key to the success of our business 
factors outside of our control  such as the demand for it staffing and solutions  available credit and capital for our clients  general economic conditions and the supply of qualified consultants  will also affect our success 
our revenue is primarily driven by bill rates and billable hours 
most of our billings for our staffing and solutions services are on a time and materials basis  which means we bill our clients based on contracted bill rates for the number of hours that each of our consultant s works on a project 
hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications 
general economic conditions  macro it and professional service expenditure trends and competition may create pressure on our pricing 
increasingly  large customers  including those with preferred supplier arrangements  
table of contents have been seeking pricing discounts in exchange for higher volumes of business or maintaining existing levels of business 
billable hours are affected by numerous factors  such as the quality and scope of our service offerings and competition at the national and local levels 
we also generate revenue from product sales which are generally recorded when the product is delivered and revenue from fixed price engagements which are generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project 
our principal operating expenses are the cost of providing our services through the use of our employee consultants or subsupplier consultants  product costs and selling  administrative and other operating costs 
cost of services is comprised primarily of the costs of consultant labor  including employees  subsuppliers and independent suppliers  and related employee benefits 
we compensate most of our consultants only for the hours that we bill to our clients  which allows us to better match our labor costs with our revenue generation 
for certain of our service offerings  our consultant employees are retained on a salaried basis which requires us to maintain effective utilization of those consultants 
with respect to our consultant employees  we are responsible for employment related taxes  medical and health care costs and workers compensation 
labor costs are sensitive to shifts in the supply and demand of our consultants  as well as increases in the costs of benefits and taxes 
the principal components of selling  administrative and other operating costs are management  administrative staff  sales and recruiting salaries  sales and recruiting commissions  facility rent and related costs and depreciation expense 
we maintain centralized support functions for our local and regional locations including sales support  financial  internal technology  human resources  and legal 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december st 
therefore  the fiscal year ends for  and were january   december   and december   respectively 
fiscal year contains weeks  whereas fiscal years and contain weeks 
the additional week in fiscal did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
overview of fiscal results during fiscal  we focused on increasing our mix of higher margin services  exiting out of low margin  non core lines of business and reducing our selling  administrative and other expenses 
the sale of symmetry  the discontinuation of our staffing relationship with one of our largest staffing accounts and the expected annualized reduction of over million in our selling  administrative and other expenses are consistent with the plan to restore us to profitability 
we also launched microsoft practice offerings in select locations and invested our technology infrastructure  sales team and leadership 
we believe all of these items are important steps in the continued transformation of our business 
our results of operations  however  have been negatively impacted in fiscal by the uncertain economic environment 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal is a result of the negative impact the economic environment has had on the demand for it professional services  staffing and products and our planned exit from non core and low margin lines of business 
early in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold symmetry  our managed staffing business  to comsys and discontinued our staffing relationship with one of our large staffing accounts 
together  business through symmetry and the large staffing account represented approximately million in quarterly revenue and million in annualized revenue 
gross margins as a percent of revenue increased due to the impact of implementing our strategy of exiting low margin lines of business and accounts and the reduction in lower margin product sales 
selling  administrative and other operating sg a expenses declined in fiscal due largely to reducing our operating costs as part of the plan and the reduction in business volume 
the fiscal loss also include a non cash charge of million to write off goodwill and a million charge for restructuring  severance and other consulting costs 

table of contents we generated cash from operations of million for fiscal as of january   we had a cash balance of million and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
results of operations for fiscal as compared to fiscal the following table illustrates the relationship between revenue and expense categories and provides a count of employees and technical consultants for fiscal versus fiscal year ended fiscal year ended fiscal increase decrease of revenue of revenue dollars in thousands amount amount amount revenue professional services provided directly professional services provided through subsuppliers product sales total revenue expenses cost of services provided directly cost of services provided through subsuppliers cost of product sales selling  administrative and other operating costs restructuring costs and other severance related costs intangible assets impairment goodwill impairment amortization of intangible assets total expenses operating loss non operating income interest expense loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss personnel management and administrative technical consultants 
table of contents revenue revenue from services provided directly declined from the comparable period a year ago 
the decline in revenue was primarily due to our decision to discontinue our relationship with one of our large staffing accounts and a reduction in the number of billable technical consultants which was partially offset by an increase in overall billing rates over the prior year 
our subsupplier revenue  which is mainly pass through revenue with associated fees  declined by over the prior year primarily due to the sale of symmetry early in the third quarter of fiscal product sales during fiscal declined by over the prior year due to an overall reduction in business volume 
cost of services provided directly cost of services provided directly represents our payroll and benefit costs associated with our billable consultants 
this category of expense as a percentage of direct services revenue was in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in expense as a percentage of direct services revenue is a result of our focus on delivering a greater level of higher value services 
these services are delivered at higher rates which enable us to better leverage the cost of service delivery 
cost of services provided through subsuppliers cost of services provided through subsuppliers represents our cost when we utilize third parties to fulfill our obligations to our large staffing clients 
this category of expense as a percentage of revenue for services provided through subsuppliers was in fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in the expense as a percentage of subsupplier revenue is a result of increased rates from our subsuppliers 
cost of product sales cost of product sales represents our cost when we resell hardware and software products 
this category of expense  as a percentage of product sales  was in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the increase in expense as a percentage of revenue is a result of the mix of product sales between the comparable periods 
selling  administrative and other operating costs sg a costs include management and administrative salaries  commissions paid to sales representatives and recruiters  location costs  and other administrative costs 
this category of costs decreased approximately million from fiscal and represented of total revenue for fiscal  compared to in fiscal sg a expenses decreased primarily as a result of our execution of the cost reduction aspects of our plan and a reduction of sales and recruiting expense due to the decrease in business volume 
restructuring costs and other severance related costs during fiscal  we recorded restructuring and severance related expenses totaling million 
of this amount  million related to workforce reductions and severance 
the remaining million related to lease obligations and abandonment costs net of anticipated sub lease income for locations where we have chosen to downsize or exit completely 
we recorded restructuring and severance related expenses of million during fiscal of this amount  million related to workforce reductions and severance 
the remaining million related to lease obligations and abandonment costs net of anticipated sub lease income for locations where we have chosen to downsize or exit completely 

table of contents intangible assets impairment during fiscal and following the termination of the principals of redwood solutions corporation redwood  a company we acquired in  we experienced a gradual decline in revenue associated with a major client relationship acquired as part of that transaction 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue from this client relationship continued to decline  and management determined it would not attempt to re engage with this relationship 
we determined the intangible customer based asset  which had been established when redwood was acquired  had become impaired 
as such  the asset  originally valued at million  net of million of accumulated amortization  was written off 
this write off resulted in an impairment charge of million 
on december   our board of directors adopted the plan to refocus our business 
as such  a decision was made to aggressively cease using the sequoianet 
com trade name acquired in following this decision  the sequoianet 
com trade name  originally valued at million  with a net recorded value of million  was written down to its fair value 
this write down resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the remaining fair value of this trade name million was amortized over the first six months of fiscal  the period of time during which the trade name was expected to continue to bring value 
goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of  we determined that events and changes in circumstances had occurred in our business that would indicate that the goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  may be impaired 
our forecast for operating results for future periods had declined and we experienced a significant reduction in the price of our publicly traded shares 
as a result of these two events  we determined it was likely that a reduction in fair value of our reporting units had occurred 
given these indicators of potential impairment  we performed an impairment evaluation as of january  which considered these changes in circumstances 
based upon the results of this analysis  we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling million 
in december  we significantly changed our key business strategies assumed in the september  goodwill evaluation 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced a significant drop in the price of our publicly traded shares 
as a result of these two events  we determined it was likely that a reduction in fair value of our reporting units had occurred 
given these indicators of potential impairment  we performed another impairment evaluation at december  which considered these changes in circumstances 
based upon the results of this analysis  we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling million for fiscal amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets relates primarily to our customer lists 
this category of expense decreased due to the write off of certain intangible assets in fiscal that were no longer amortized in fiscal non operating income non operating income decreased by million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the prior year included a million non cash item resulting from the return of  shares of our common stock from an escrow account following the departure of two of the principals of redwood 
interest expense interest expense decreased by approximately million for fiscal due to a decrease in average borrowings to million from million in fiscal additionally  a reduction in interest 
table of contents rates from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal reduced the amount of interest expense 
income taxes during fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes for amounts due for certain state income taxes and changes in our reserves for tax obligations 
we recorded no additional income tax expense associated with our net operating losses because any tax expense that would otherwise have been recorded has been negated by adjusting the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
if  however  we successfully return to profitability to a point where future realization of deferred tax assets  which are currently reserved  become more likely than not  we may be required to reverse our existing valuation allowances to realize the benefit of those assets 
during fiscal  we recorded million of income tax expense  which relates to a million increase to the valuation allowance to fully reserve our remaining deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal personnel our technical consulting staff levels finished the year at approximately  a reduction from the prior year 
the decline in technical consulting staff levels is due to a reduction of approximately billable consultants as a result of the transfer of our existing contract with one of our largest staffing accounts to other suppliers and an overall decline in business volume 
the decline in management and administrative personnel is due to our focus on reducing the number of management and administrative personnel that are necessary to support the business operations 
the reported technical consulting staff levels exclude our medical concepts staffing  our medical staffing business  due to the separate industry focus of that business 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

table of contents revenue services revenue provided directly by our employees during fiscal decreased from fiscal  while revenue from subsuppliers and product sales increased and  respectively  during the same period 
early in fiscal  we experienced a significant decline in the number of billable technical staff due to a high number of purchase order expirations 
this is typical for our business 
we made some progress during fiscal on improving average bill rates and regaining some of the headcount we lost early in the year 
by the end of fiscal  however  we had not returned to our beginning headcount numbers  and we had not managed to return our direct services revenue to fiscal levels 
during fiscal  a higher percentage of our total revenue came from subsuppliers compared to fiscal our subsupplier revenue is mainly pass through revenue with associated fees for management and administration providing minimal profit 
in october  we began providing managed services to a significant new client 
as a result of this new relationship  subsupplier revenue grew in fiscal product sales increased in fiscal over fiscal the increase in product sales occurred largely in our ip communications business where we resell a significant amount of cisco ip telephony products 
cost of services provided directly cost of services provided directly primarily represents the direct payroll and benefit costs associated with billable consultants 
as a percent of service revenue  these costs increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease in fiscal direct service margins was driven by a higher concentration of national accounts where margins are lower than our other direct business and a continuing decline in the margins we generate from our largest client 
cost of services provided through subsuppliers cost of services provided through subsuppliers represents the cost when we utilize third parties to fulfill our obligations to our large staffing clients 
this category of expense as a percentage of revenue for services provided through subsuppliers was in fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in expense as a percentage of subsupplier revenue is due to an improvement in the rates charged by our subsuppliers 
cost of product sales cost of product sales represents our cost of the hardware and software products we sell 
these costs  as a percentage of product sales  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal although a change in policy at one of our technology partners enabled us to drive product revenue higher during much of fiscal  the products comprising much of this increased volume was sold at lower margins than we have seen in previous periods 
these lower margins during much of the year were offset by very favorable margins on products sold during the fourth quarter 
vendor pricing and promotional programs change regularly causing the margins we realize when selling product to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
selling  administrative and other operating costs sg a costs include management and administrative salaries  commissions paid to sales representatives and recruiters  location costs  and other administrative costs 
this category of costs represented of total revenue for fiscal  down slightly from in fiscal the decline in these costs is reflective of the cost reduction measures implemented early in fiscal 
table of contents restructuring costs and other severance related costs in connection with the implementation of our new business plan and other executive management changes  we recorded restructuring and severance related costs of million for fiscal of this amount  million related to workforce reductions and severance 
the remaining million related to lease obligations and abandonment costs net of anticipated sub lease income for locations where we have chosen to downsize or exit completely 
intangible assets impairment during fiscal and following the termination of the principals of redwood  we experienced a gradual decline in revenue associated with a major client relationship acquired as part of that transaction

on december   our board of directors adopted the plan to refocus our business 
as such  a decision was made to cease using the sequoianet 
com trade name acquired in fiscal following this decision  the sequoianet 
com trade name  originally valued at million  with a net recorded value of million  was written down to its fair value 
this write down resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the remaining fair value of this trade name million was amortized over the first six months of fiscal  the period of time during which the trade name was expected to continue to bring value 
goodwill impairment in december  we significantly changed our key business strategies assumed in the september  goodwill evaluation 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced a significant drop in the price of our publicly traded shares 
as a result of these two events  we determined it was likely that a reduction in fair value of our reporting units had occurred 
given these indicators of potential impairment  we performed another impairment evaluation at december  which considered these changes in circumstances 
based upon the results of this analysis  we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling million for fiscal amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets is related primarily to our customer lists and is relatively constant due to no significant changes in the intangible assets being amortized 
non operating income non operating income during fiscal consisted primarily of a non cash item resulting from the return of  shares of common stock from an escrow account following the departure of two principals of a company we acquired in these shares were valued at million 
interest expense interest expense during fiscal decreased by million as compared to fiscal due to a decrease in average borrowings under the line of credit from million to million and a decrease in interest rates 

table of contents income taxes during fiscal  we recorded million of income tax expense 
the majority of this expense relates to a million increase to the valuation allowance to fully reserve our remaining deferred tax assets at the end of during fiscal  we continued our practice of recording no income tax benefit associated with our net losses because the benefit created by our operating losses have been negated by the establishment of additional reserves against our deferred assets 
if we successfully return to profitability to a point where future realization of deferred tax assets which are currently reserved  becomes more likely than not  we may be required to reverse our existing valuation allowances resulting in an income tax benefit 
personnel our billable technical consulting staff levels at the end of fiscal finished the year down by approximately consultants from the end of fiscal this number excludes headcount of our subsuppliers and headcount from medical concepts staffing  our medical staffing business  due to the separate industry focus of that business 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
liquidity and capital resources the following table provides information relative to the liquidity of our business 
in thousands january  december  increase decrease percentage increase decrease cash and cash equivalents   nm accounts receivable other current assets total current assets accounts payable salaries and vacations line of credit restructuring accruals current other current liabilities total current liabilities working capital current ratio total shareholders equity nm not meaningful 
table of contents change in working capital working capital was million at january   down approximately million from december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased by at january   compared to december  our total current assets decreased approximately million in compared to the prior year as a result of significantly lower accounts receivable offset slightly by an increase in our cash and cash equivalents 
our accounts receivable decreased primarily due to the sale of symmetry and the discontinuation of our staffing relationship with one of our largest staffing accounts in the third quarter and the general decline in business volume 
our total current liabilities decreased approximately million in compared to the prior year primarily due to a decline in subsupplier activity  fewer personnel  and the timing of our fiscal year end as it relates to salary accruals 
in  accounts payable declined approximately million due to the impact of eliminating the subsuppliers involved with symmetry and a decline in subsupplier volume 
the timing of our fiscal year end and the reduction in personnel during is primarily responsible for the lower salaries and vacations payable balance while current year cash flows from operations enabled us to repay the outstanding line of credit balance 
in addition  severance payments associated with restructuring and payments made to previous participants of our deferred compensation plans contributed in reducing our total current liabilities for the year ended january  compared to the prior year 
we believe our working capital and availability under our ge capital credit agreement will be sufficient to support the cash flow needs of our business in fiscal continuing operating losses  a significant increase in bad debt experience  a significant lengthening of payment terms  or significant costs associated with restructuring activities could create a need for additional working capital 
an inability to obtain additional working capital  should it be required  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we expect to be able to comply with the requirements of our credit agreement  however  failure to do so could affect our ability to obtain necessary working capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  the current ge capital credit agreement expires on january  we expect to either renew or obtain a new credit facility during fiscal sources and uses of cash credit facility cash and cash equivalents increased by million from december  to january  our primary need for working capital is to support accounts receivable and to fund the time lag between payroll and vendor disbursements and receipt of fees billed to clients 
historically  we have been able to support internal growth in our business with internally generated funds and the use of our credit facility 
our asset based revolving credit agreement provides up to million of availability 
at january   our borrowing availability under this credit facility  which fluctuates based on our level of eligible accounts receivable  was million and we had no amounts outstanding 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by all of our assets 
this line of credit is available to us to fund working capital needs and other investments such as acquisitions as these needs arise 
we believe we will be able to continue to meet the requirements of this agreement 
the revolving credit agreement requires us to take advances or pay down the outstanding balance on the line of credit daily 
however  we can request fixed term advances of one  two or three months for a portion of the outstanding balance on the line of credit 
effective august   we amended our credit agreement and modified certain terms of the agreement 
the amendment reduced the annual commitment fee to of the unused portion of the line  reduced the annual administration fee to  and reduced the interest rates on daily advances to the wall street journal s prime 
table of contents rate  or as of january   and fixed term advances to the applicable libor rate plus 
the agreement continues  among other things  to prohibit the payment of dividends and to restrict capital expenditures 
effective january   we again amended the credit agreement extending the expiration date from october  to january  the amendment eliminated certain reserves in calculating the amount we can borrow under the facility and changed the definition of eligible accounts receivable in calculating our borrowing capacity 
the effect of the modifications was to increase the borrowing capacity under the line by approximately million 
during fiscal  we made capital expenditures totaling million compared to million in fiscal on july   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our common stock 
on july   we amended our credit agreement with ge capital to allow us to repurchase up to  of our common stock 
timing of repurchases will be based on several factors  including the price of the common stock  general market conditions  corporate and regulatory requirements and alternate investment opportunities 
repurchases may be made in the open market or through private transactions  in accordance with sec requirements 
repurchases may be suspended at any time and are subject to the terms and conditions of our credit agreement with ge capital which includes restrictions based on our borrowing availability under the credit agreement and a maximum dollar expenditure for repurchases 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of 
in fiscal  we did not engage in any repurchases of our common stock 
as of january   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if we are successful in reaching profitability  we expect our net operating loss carry forwards to offset approximately million of pre tax earnings from federal and state income taxes 
contractual obligations we have entered into arrangements that represent certain commitments and have arrangements with certain contingencies 
we lease office facilities under non cancelable operating leases  are engaged in license agreements with future commitments  and have deferred compensation that is payable to participants in accordance with the terms of our restated special executive retirement plan and other agreements 
our line of credit that was paid in full as of january   expires on january  our line of credit balance is treated as a current liability on our balance sheet as our agreement requires us to take advances or pay down the outstanding balance daily 
we incur interest expense on all amounts outstanding on our line of credit at a variable interest rate 
we incur interest expense on certain portions of our deferred compensation obligation

table of contents critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the estimates described below are the most sensitive estimates made by management in the preparation of the financial statements 
estimates of future operating results realization of certain assets recorded in our consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
in evaluating the recorded value of our intangible assets and deferred tax assets  we are required to make critical accounting estimates regarding our future operating results 
these estimates are based on management s current expectations but involve risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates 
to evaluate our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we rely heavily on our undiscounted cash flow model to assess the value of the asset at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
the undiscounted cash flow valuation technique requires us to project operating results and the related cash flows over a ten year period 
these projections involve risks  uncertainties and other factors and are by their nature subjective 
if actual results were substantially below projected results  an impairment of the recorded value of our indefinite lived intangible assets could result 
to assess the recorded value of our deferred tax assets for possible impairment  we must predict the likelihood of future taxable income generation 
realization of any net deferred tax assets requires the generation of future taxable income prior to the expiration of the federal and state net operating loss carry forward benefits 
allowance for doubtful accounts in each reporting period  we determine an amount to set aside to cover potentially uncollectible accounts 
an evaluation of accounts receivable for risk associated with a client s ability to make contractually required payments is used to determine this reserve 
these determinations require considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate potential for collection of these receivables and include reviewing the financial stability of the client  the clients ability to pay and current market conditions 
if our evaluation of a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future charges 
accrual of unreported medical claims in each reporting period  we estimate an amount to accrue for medical costs incurred but not yet reported under our self funded employee medical insurance plan 
we base our determination on an evaluation of past rates of claim payouts and trends in the amount of payouts 
this determination requires significant judgment and assumes past patterns are representative of future payment patterns and that we have identified any trends in our claim experience 
a significant shift in usage and payment patterns within our medical plans could necessitate significant adjustments to these accruals in future accounting periods 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties or affect significant line items within our financial statements and potentially result in 
table of contents materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
goodwill statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets prohibits companies from amortizing purchased goodwill 
instead  we examine our goodwill at least annually to determine if impairment has occurred 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company is required to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company currently performs the annual evaluation of goodwill as of the last day of its monthly accounting period for august 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of trade names and customer lists 
we evaluate our trade names and client lists for possible impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or the disposal of long lived assets requires that if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  then the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between reported income and income considered taxable by the taxing authorities 
sfas no 
also requires the resulting deferred tax assets to be reduced by a valuation allowance if some portion or all of the deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized 
sales taxes we account for our sales tax and any other taxes that are collected from our clients and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis 
the assessment  collection and payment of these taxes are not reflected on our income statement 
restructuring and other severance related costs while we believe our current estimates regarding lease obligations are adequate  our inability to sublet the remaining space  negotiate early termination agreements or obtain payments from sub lessees could necessitate significant adjustments to these estimates in the future 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue as services are performed 
this includes staffing services  technology integration services  and outsourcing and advisory services that are billed on an hourly basis 
for product sales  except in rare circumstances  we act as the primary obligor in the transaction 
accordingly  except for those rare situations where net revenue reporting is appropriate because we are acting as an agent in the sale of product  product revenue is recorded for the gross amount of the transaction when the products are delivered 
certain of our outsourcing and help desk engagements provide for a specific level of service each month for which we bill a standard monthly fee 
revenue for these engagements is recognized in monthly installments over the period of the contract 
in some such 
table of contents contracts we invoice in advance for two or more months of service 
when we do this  the revenue is deferred and recognized over the term of the contractual agreement 
in certain situations  we will contract to sell both product including third party software and or hardware and services in a single client arrangement with multiple deliverables 
these arrangements are generally to resell certain products and to provide the service necessary to install such products and optimize functionality of such products 
we account for multiple deliverable arrangements involving third party software products under the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition and have established vendor specific objective evidence of each deliverable 
other non software related multiple deliverable arrangements are accounted for utilizing the guidelines of etif  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we account for each of the components of multiple deliverable arrangements separately by using the identified fair values of each component to allocate the total consideration of the arrangement to the separate components 
in certain client situations  where the nature of the engagement requires it  we utilize the services of other companies in our industry 
if these services are provided under an arrangement whereby we agree to retain only a fixed portion of the amount billed to the client to cover our management and administrative costs  we classify the amount billed to the client as subsupplier revenue 
these revenues  however  are recorded on a gross versus net basis because we retain credit risk and are the primary obligor to our client 
all revenue derived from services provided by our employees or other independent contractors working directly for us are recorded as direct revenue 
we periodically enter into fixed price engagements 
when we enter into such an engagement  revenue is recognized over the life of the contract based on time and materials input to date and estimate time and materials to complete the project 
this method of revenue recognition relies on accurate estimates of the cost  scope  and duration of the engagement 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  then future revenues may be negatively affected or losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
all future anticipated losses are recognized in the period they are identified 
income taxes we file a consolidated income tax return in the us federal jurisdiction 
we also file consolidated or separate company income tax returns in most states  canada federal  ontario province and the united kingdom 
as of january   there are no federal  state  and foreign income tax audits in progress 
we are no longer subject to us federal audits for tax years before  and with few exceptions  the same for state and local audits 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes
