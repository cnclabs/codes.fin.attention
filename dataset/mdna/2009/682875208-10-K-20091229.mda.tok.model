fiscal highlights and recent developments during fiscal we received million from rockridge capital holdings  llc rockridge  an entity controlled by one of our largest shareholders  in accordance with the terms of a note and stock purchase agreement that we entered into with rockridge dated april  and which was amended on september  we also received another  under the note and stock purchase agreement on october   resulting in cumulative allowable borrowings of million 
this transaction is secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets  such lien subordinated only to the extent higher priority liens on assets  primarily accounts receivable and certain designated software and equipment  are held by certain of our other lenders and is repayable in equal monthly installments through august   which installments include principal plus interest at per annum 
the outstanding principal amount  or portions thereof  are convertible into our common stock under certain conditions and the note and stock purchase agreement also provides that rockridge may receive an origination fee of  restricted onsm common shares 
see liquidity and capital resources 
on december  we entered into an agreement with a certain financial institution the lender whereby our collateralized line of credit arrangement the line was amended to extend it for two years through december  and to increase the borrowing limit to million subject to our accounts receivable balances and aging 
in addition  effective december   the outstanding balance will bear interest at per annum  adjusted for future changes in the prime rate and we will incur a weekly monitoring fee of one twentieth of a percent of the borrowing limit 
the interest rate at the time of the amendment was per annum prime rate plus  with no monitoring fee 
as a result of this amendment  certain financial covenants were also relaxed 
see liquidity and capital resources 
during december  we received funding commitment letters executed by three entities agreeing to provide us  within twenty days after our notice given on or before december   aggregate cash funding of  the funding under the commitment letters would be in exchange for our equity under mutually agreeable terms to be negotiated at the time of funding  or in the event such terms could not be reached  in the form of repayable debt 
terms of the repayable debt would also be subject to negotiation at the time of funding  provided that  among other things  the debt would be unsecured and the rate of return on such debt  including cash and equity consideration given  would not be greater than i a cash coupon rate of fifteen percent per annum and a ii total effective interest rate of thirty percent per annum 
we received a letter from nasdaq dated january  indicating that we had calendar days  or until july   to regain compliance with what is now listing rule a formerly marketplace rule c the rule  which is necessary in order to be eligible for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market 
the nasdaq letter indicated that our non compliance with the rule was as a result of the bid price of onsm common stock closing below per share for the preceding thirty consecutive business days 
after a series of extensions arising from nasdaq s suspension of their enforcement of this listing requirement  the final extension ended on july  since we were in a bid price compliance period at the time of the initial suspension  we remained at the same stage of the process we were in when the nasdaq first announced the suspension until that suspension was terminated on july  accordingly we were subsequently notified by nasdaq that we had until october  to regain compliance with the rule 
on october   we received a letter from nasdaq stating that since we had not regained compliance with the rule as of october   our common stock was subject to delisting 
however  such delisting would not occur if we requested a hearing with the nasdaq listing qualifications panel the panel and pending the panel s decision subsequent to that hearing 
we requested such a hearing with the panel  which we attended on december   and at which time we presented our plan for regaining compliance with the rule and requested that our securities be allowed to remain listed pending the completion of that plan 
based on the panel s consideration of that plan  as well as any other relevant factors  the panel has the ability to grant us a period of up to days counting from the date of the october  letter to regain compliance with the rule 
as of december   the panel had not informed us of their decision and there can be no assurance that the panel will grant our request for continued listing 
we might be considered compliant with the rule  subject to the nasdaq staff s discretion  if our common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days 
the closing onsm share price was per share on december  although we have not decided on such action  we have been advised that as a florida corporation we may implement a reverse split of our common shares without shareholder approval  provided a proportionate reduction is made in the number of our authorized common shares and we provide appropriate advance notice to nasdaq and other applicable authorities 
the terms of the senior convertible debentures and the subordinated convertible debentures and the related warrants issued by us from december through april  plus the common shares issued by us in connection with the april infinite merger  contain penalty clauses if our common stock is not traded on nasdaq or a similar national exchange 
on december   narrowstep filed a complaint against us in the court of chancery of the state of delaware  seeking million in damages plus other fees  costs  interest and other remedies in connection with our termination of the narrowstep merger agreement 
after reviewing the complaint  we determined that narrowstep has no basis in fact or in law for any claim and accordingly  this matter has not been reflected as a liability on our financial statements 
furthermore  we do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
see details in item legal proceedings above 
on may   we were served with a summons and complaint filed in broward county  florida  containing a breach of contract claim against us by a firm seeking compensation for legal services allegedly rendered to us  plus court costs  in the amount of approximately  we have accrued approximately  related to this matter on our financial statements as of september  we believe that the ultimate resolution of the matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

results of operations our consolidated net loss for the year ended september  was approximately million loss per share as compared to a loss of approximately million loss per share for the prior fiscal year  an increase in our loss of approximately million 
the increased net loss was primarily due to a million charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the current fiscal year arising from the difference between our market capitalization  as adjusted  and our net book value ie  stockholders equity as reflected in our financial statements versus no comparable amount in the prior fiscal year 
the following table shows  for the periods presented  the percentage of revenue represented by items on our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended september  revenue dmsp and hosting webcasting audio and web conferencing network usage other total revenue cost of revenue dmsp and hosting webcasting audio and web conferencing network usage other total costs of revenue gross margin operating expenses compensation professional fees write off deferred acquisition costs impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets other general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses loss from operations other expense  net interest expense other income  net total other expense  net net loss the following table is presented to illustrate our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition 
this table should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes therein 
for the years ended september  increase decrease amount percent total revenue total costs of revenue gross margin general and administrative expenses write off deferred acquisition costs impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets depreciation and amortization total operating expenses loss from operations other expense  net net loss revenues and gross margin consolidated operating revenue was approximately million for the year ended september   a decrease of approximately  from the prior fiscal year  primarily due to decreased revenues of the audio and web conferencing services group  although revenues of the digital media services group also decreased during this period 
audio and web conferencing services group revenues were approximately million for the year ended september   a decrease of approximately  from the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily a result of i decreased network usage service fees from the ednet division and ii decreased network equipment sales and rental revenues from the ednet division  which decreases we believe resulted from a reduction in television and movie production activity in the current year in response to a general economic slow down 
for some time the infinite division sales force has been focusing on entering into agreements with organizations with resources to provide infinite s audio and web conferencing services to certain targeted groups 
in april  we announced infinite s strategic partnership with proforma  a leading provider of graphic communications solutions 
in august  we announced that infinite signed a reseller agreement with copper conferencing  one of the nation s leading  carrier class conferencing services providers for small and medium sized businesses 
in march we announced infinite s master agency agreement with presidio networked solutions  a systems integrator 
in april  we announced infinite s collaboration with peerport to launch webmeet community  an integrated suite of virtual collaboration services 
although these relationships and initiatives are important as a basis for building future sales  in some cases there will be a lead time of a year or longer before they are reflected in actual recorded sales 
furthermore  we recently began a reorganization of the infinite management and sales staff  which included the hiring of a new divisional president in june therefore  due to the expected effects of the recent infinite reorganization still in process  as well as the ednet trends discussed above which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future  we do not expect the fiscal revenues of the audio and web conferencing services group for the year as a whole to exceed the fiscal amounts 
digital media services group revenues were approximately million for the year ended september   a decrease of approximately  from the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to an approximately  decrease in webcasting division revenues plus smaller decreases in certain other divisions 
however we recorded an approximately  net increase in dmsp and hosting division revenues over the prior fiscal year 
this increase in dmsp and hosting division revenues included i an approximately  increase in dmsp store and stream and streaming publisher revenues and ii an approximately  increase in hosting and bandwidth charges to certain larger dmsp customers serviced by our smart encoding division 
as of september   we had monthly recurring subscribers to the store and stream and or streaming publisher applications of the dmsp  which applications were developed as a focused interface for small to medium business smb clients  as compared to subscribers as of september  including large dmsp hosting customers supported by our smart encoding division  these customer counts were and  respectively 
we expect this dmsp customer base to continue to grow  especially as a result of our recent launch of version of streaming publisher 
streaming publisher is designed to provide enhanced capabilities for advanced users such as publishers  media companies and other content developers 
the streaming publisher upgrade to the dmsp is a key step in our objective to address the developing online video advertising market and includes features such as automated transcoding the ability to convert media files into multiple file formats  player gallery the ability to create various video players and detailed usage reports  as well as advanced permissions  security and syndication features 
users of the basic store and stream version of the dmsp may easily upgrade to the streaming publisher version for a higher monthly fee 
in addition to the development of these additional features and products  we have made progress on our development of an enhanced video search function  which is now referred to as video search engine optimization vseo 
vseo is based on the software and hardware infrastructure purchased primarily from autonomy virage plus the allocation of internal resources from our programming and development professionals 
although the timing of further vseo development is subject to our overall development priorities  it is currently expected to be released no later than the end of fiscal in addition to the store and stream and streaming publisher applications of the dmsp  we are continuing to work with several entities assisting us in the deployment via the dmsp of enabling technologies necessary to create social networks with integrated professional and user generated multimedia content 
one of the key components of our march acquisition of auction video was the video ingestion and flash transcoder  already integrated into the dmsp as an integral component of the services offered to social network providers and other user generated video ugv applications 
auction video s technology is being used in various applications such as online yellow pages listings  delivering video to mobile phones  multi level marketing and online newspaper classified advertisements  and can also provide for direct input from webcams and other imaging equipment 
in addition  our auction video service was approved by ebay to provide video hosting services for ebay users and powersellers high volume users of ebay 
the auction video acquisition is another strategic step in providing a complete range of enabling  turnkey technologies for our clients to facilitate video on the web applications  which we believe will make the dmsp a more competitive option as an increasing number of companies look to enhance their web presence with digital rich media and social applications 
in addition to the beneficial effect of the auction video technology on dmsp revenues  we believe that our ownership of that technology will provide us with other revenue opportunities  including software sales and licensing fees  although the timing and amount of these revenues cannot be assured 
in march we retained the law firm of hunton williams to assist in expediting the patent approval process and helping protect our rights related to our patent pending ugv technology 
in april  we revised the original patent application primarily for the purpose of splitting it into two separate applications  which  while related  are being evaluated separately by the us patent office uspo 
in august  february and may  the uspo issued non final rejections of the claims pending in the first of the two applications 
in october we submitted an amendment to the first of the two applications  which amendment we expect the uspo to respond to within ninety days after the date of our submission 
regardless of this  our management has determined that a final rejection of these claims would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the uspo has taken no formal action with regard to the second of the two applications 
certain of the former owners of auction video  inc have an interest in proceeds that we may receive under certain circumstances in connection with these patents 
as a result of this technology  plus other enhancements to the dmsp as noted above and our increased sales and marketing focus on opportunities with social networks and other high volume users of digital rich media  as well as a result of sales of the recently launched version of streaming publisher  we expect the fiscal dmsp and hosting revenues for the year as a whole to exceed the corresponding fiscal amounts  although such increase cannot be assured 
as mentioned above  webcasting revenues decreased by for the year ended september  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  the number of webcasts produced increased to approximately  webcasts for the year ended september   versus approximately  webcasts for the prior fiscal year 
since most of the event increase was attributable to audio events with a lower per event cost than video events  the average revenue per webcast event decreased to approximately for the current fiscal year period as compared to approximately for the prior fiscal year 
the number of webcasts reported  as well as the resulting calculation of the average revenue per webcast event  does not include any webcast events attributed with or less revenue  based on our determination that excluding such low priced or even no charge events increases the usefulness of this statistic 
although webcasting revenues declined during the fourth quarter of fiscal from the revenue levels for the first three quarters of that fiscal year  we are already seeing the start of a return to those previous revenue levels  based on order flow and other sales activity thus far for the first quarter of fiscal we remain optimistic with respect to an increased level of revenues during fiscal as a result of this initial revenue improvement as well as the following factors which we believe will favorably impact our webcasting revenues in fiscal bt reseller agreement in october  we announced an expansion of our business relationship with bt conferencing  a division of bt group plc  one of the world s leading providers of communications solutions and services  via the signing of a new webcasting  iencode  and digital media services reseller agreement 
under the strategic global reseller agreement  bt conferencing will now be offering our webcasting  iencode and digital media services to its new and existing clients worldwide 
in addition  we will be using bt conferencing infrastructure and services to support our operations 
expanding government business in november we announced that we had been awarded a stake in a three year master services agreement msa by the state of california to provide video and audio streaming services to the state and participating local governments 
in august we announced that we had been awarded three new multi year public sector webcasting services contracts with the united states nuclear regulatory commission nrc  california state department of technology services dts  and california state board of equalization boe 
in april we announced that  in addition to the extension of the nrc contract for the first full year after a successful initial test period  we were engaged to perform webcasting services for use by the us department of interior  minerals management service  via a strategic partner relationship 
we recognized related revenues for all of the above government related contracts of approximately  and  for the years ended september  and  respectively 
in november  we announced that we were engaged to perform webcasting services for the department of the treasury s internal revenue service irs and to provide webinar services for use by the us department of housing and urban development s federal housing administration fha philadelphia homeownership center hoc  via a strategic partner relationship 
we also announced the extension of the nrc contract  discussed above  for the second full year 
new products and technology we recently launched iencode  a full featured  turnkey  standalone webcasting solution  designed to operate inside a corporate lan environment with multicast capabilities 
although we recorded some iencode revenue during fiscal and we introduced version v of iencode in june  v was not available for delivery to our customers until december we expect to ship v units and supply v upgrades to the more than existing installations of the prior version of these appliances total by the end of the second fiscal quarter 
as a result  we expect iencode sales to increase to more meaningful levels in fiscal  as compared to fiscal we have recently completed several feature enhancements to our proprietary webcasting platform  including embedded flash video and animations as well as a webinar service providing the means to hold a virtual seminar online in real time and both audio and video editing capabilities 
in addition  we recently announced an upgrade to our webcasting service  featuring broadcast quality video using the industry standard aspect ratio  which we named visual webcaster hd 
the new upgrade includes the ability to use high definition cameras and other hd sources input via sdi serial digital interface into our encoders  providing a broadcast quality experience 
during fiscal  we began the development of the marketplace mp platform  which will enable the creation of on line virtual marketplaces  trade shows and social communities 
we will charge each promoter a monthly fee based on the number of exhibitors within their mp marketplace  as well as a share of the revenue from advertising in their mp marketplace  but we also expect to recognize additional revenue beyond these exhibitor and advertising fees since mp will integrate with and utilize almost all of our other technologies including dmsp  webcasting  ugc and conferencing 
mp will be available for sale by january and we already have several expressions of interest and or preliminary commitments for mp marketplaces from the existing publishers and trade show companies that we have already introduced the product to 
we have had very positive feedback from our existing distributors and clients for the initial trial version of this product  and we expect to be able to sign a meaningful number of promoter contracts within the next several months 
in december  we announced an agreement with the tarsus group plc tarsus to implement and market mp to tarsus more than  trade shows and  suppliers that are part of their trade show news network www 
tsnn 
com  a leading online resource for the trade show  exhibition and event industry 
due to the significant revenue potential from a single mp sale  which we estimate to be as much as  per year  we expect this product will have a significant impact on our future revenues 
however  every mp sale will not be expected to generate this level of revenue and the attainment of any revenue from a mp sale will be subject to various factors  including the implementation of the mp product by the promoter purchaser  including the sales of booths to exhibitors and related advertising  which amount and timing cannot be assured 
due to the anticipated increases in webcasting revenues  the anticipated increases in dmsp and hosting revenues and revenues upon the introduction of marketplace  all as discussed above  we expect the fiscal revenues of the digital media services group for the year as a whole to exceed the corresponding fiscal amounts  although such increase cannot be assured 
consolidated gross margin was approximately million for the year ended september   a decrease of approximately  from the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was due to approximately  less gross margin from the audio and web conferencing services group  corresponding to the  decrease in audio and web conferencing services group revenues as discussed above  as well as decreased gross margin percentage on those revenues from to 
primary reasons for this decreased gross margin percentage were i certain costs related to providing webconferencing services that are generally fixed to us and do not vary with utilization ii increased costs from purchasing additional overflow operating capacity from third parties and iii decreases in our per minute charges to certain customers deemed necessary in order to respond to competition 
the consolidated gross margin percentage was for the year ended september   versus for the prior fiscal year 
the consolidations of two of our co location facilities into two other existing locations are in process and expected to be completed during the second fiscal quarter 
during the third fiscal quarter  we are planning to discontinue the use of a third party software application incorporated as part of our dmsp and hosting services in favor of a less costly application 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  we are also planning to reduce the number of telephone switches and or switch locations used by our infinite division 
these consolidations  as well as recently negotiated reductions in our bandwidth and telephone line and usage rates  are expected to reduce our cost of sales by approximately  during fiscal  as compared to those costs for fiscal  although such results cannot be assured 
based primarily on our expectations of increased digital media services group sales  as well as the cost savings in process and expected to have some impact in fiscal  both as discussed above  we expect consolidated gross margin in dollars for fiscal year for the year as a whole to exceed the prior fiscal year  although such increase cannot be assured 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses were approximately million for the year ended september   an increase of approximately million over the prior fiscal year  primarily due to charges in the current fiscal year for i goodwill impairment and ii a write off of deferred acquisition costs  versus no comparable amounts in the prior fiscal year 
the effect of such charges  which totaled approximately million  plus the effect of an increase of approximately  in compensation expense for the year ended september   was partially offset by declines in professional fees expense and depreciation and amortization expense in the current fiscal year as compared to those amounts in the prior fiscal year 
the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the accounting standards codification asc issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
there is a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment 
we performed impairment tests on acquired onstream as of december   including an assessment of the fair value of the net assets of this reporting unit by considering the projected cash flows and by analysis of comparable companies  including such factors as the relationship of the comparable companies revenues to their respective market values 
although  based on these factors  the first step of the two step testing process of acquired onstream s net assets which include the dmsp preliminarily indicated that the fair value of those intangible assets exceeded their recorded carrying value as of december   it was noted that as a result of the then recent substantial volatility in the capital markets  our stock price and market value had decreased significantly and as of december   our market capitalization  after appropriate adjustments for control premium and other considerations  was determined to be less than our net book value ie  stockholders equity as reflected in our financial statements 
based on this condition  and in accordance with the provisions of the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the asc  we recorded a non cash expense  for the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets  of million for the three months ended december  none of our reporting units with significant goodwill or intangible assets were scheduled for a recurring annual impairment review during the september  quarter and as of september   we noted no business or other conditions that would indicate the necessity for interim step one testing of individual reporting units for impairment 
therefore  the comparison of our market capitalization to our net book value as of september  was not considered to be relevant at that date  and the non cash expense for the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets was also million for the year ended september  however  if our stock price and market value continue at the december  levels per share or decline further  such condition may result in future non cash impairment charges to our results of operations related to our goodwill and other intangible assets arising from our next scheduled recurring annual impairment review  which will be as of december  on may   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement to acquire narrowstep  inc narrowstep  which merger agreement was amended twice on august  and on september  
the terms of the merger agreement  as amended  allowed that if the acquisition did not close on or prior to november   the merger agreement could be terminated by either us or narrowstep at any time after that date provided that the terminating party was not responsible for the delay 
on march   we terminated the merger agreement and the acquisition of narrowstep 
as a result of this termination  we recorded the write off of  of certain previously deferred acquisition related costs  which is reflected in our operating results for the year ended september  we may incur additional future costs and expenses related to narrowstep but not included in this write off  arising from a lawsuit filed against us by narrowstep on december  see further discussion in item legal proceedings above 
we do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  although this cannot be assured 
compensation expense for the year ended september  was approximately  greater than the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due an approximately  increase in our infinite division s selling and operating payroll expenses and an approximately  increase in non cash expenses related to equity based compensation shares and options for all divisions  partially offset by an approximately  increase in the amount of internal software development salaries and benefits capitalized by us  all items for fiscal as compared to fiscal on august   our compensation committee granted  five year plan options to senior management in exchange for the cancellation of an equivalent number of non plan options held by those individuals and expiring at various dates through december  with no change in the exercise prices  which are all in excess of the market value of an onsm share as of august  as a result of this cancellation and corresponding issuance  we recognized non cash compensation expense of approximately  for the year ended september   of which  was included in compensation expense and the remainder recognized as professional fee expense 
during fiscal year  we have taken aggressive steps to reduce operating costs  including compensation related expenses 
in addition  effective october   a significant portion of our workforce  including all of management  took a payroll reduction  which we expect will be maintained until increased revenue levels result in positive cash flow 
this action  as well as payroll cost reduction actions we took during fiscal  represent anticipated compensation expense reductions of approximately million for fiscal  as compared to fiscal regardless of the above  it is possible that some or all of this savings will be offset by compensation cost increases as a result of other actions we may deem necessary in fiscal as compared to fiscal on december   our compensation committee granted  five year plan options to senior management in exchange for the cancellation of an equivalent number of non plan options held by those individuals and expiring in december  with no change in the exercise price  which was in excess of the market value of an onsm share as of the grant date 
as a result of this cancellation and corresponding issuance  we expect to recognize non cash compensation and professional fee expense of approximately  for the three months ended december  professional fee expense for the year ended september  was approximately  less than the prior fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily due to lower non cash expenses related to equity based compensation shares and options paid for financial and other consulting services 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended september  was approximately million less than the prior fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily due to i reduced depreciation expense related to the dmsp as a result of certain dmsp components reaching the end of the useful lives assigned to them for book depreciation purposes and ii reduced amortization expense related to certain intangible assets as a result of the impairment loss we recorded during the three months ended december   which was recorded as a reduction of the historical depreciable cost basis of those assets as of that date 
based primarily on expected reductions in compensation costs for fiscal compared to fiscal as discussed above  we expect our consolidated operating expenses for fiscal year to be less than the corresponding prior year amounts excluding any reduction arising from the lack of goodwill impairment charges or write offs of acquisition costs in fiscal as compared to those costs in fiscal  although this cannot be assured 
other expense other expense of approximately  for the year ended september  represented an approximately  increase as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this additional expense was primarily related to an increase in interest expense of approximately  arising from a much higher level of interest bearing debt  as well as increased effective interest rates  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  as of september   we had outstanding interest bearing debt with a total face amount of approximately million  which was primarily comprised of i approximately million in borrowings outstanding for working capital under a line of credit arrangement with a financial institution  collateralized by our accounts receivable and bearing interest at prime plus as of september   ii convertible debentures for financing software and equipment purchases with a balance of million and bearing interest expense at per annum and iii the rockridge note balance of approximately million and incurring interest expense at per annum 
in addition to these stated interest amounts  we are also recognizing interest expense as a result of amortizing discount on these debts 
as compared to the approximately million of interest bearing debt as of september   the total was approximately million as of september  in addition to this debt increase of approximately  during fiscal  the interest rate on our working capital line of credit increased from prime plus as of september  to as of september  and the rockridge note borrowings in april carried an effective interest rate of per annum until the september amendment  at which time the effective interest rate was reduced to approximately per annum 
as discussed above our collateralized line of credit arrangement the line was amended in december and as a result the borrowing limit was increased to million and the interest rate modified to be per annum  adjusted for future changes in the prime rate  plus a weekly monitoring fee of one twentieth of a percent of the borrowing limit 
the interest rate at the time of the amendment was per annum prime rate plus but there was no monitoring fee 
based on the outstanding balance of approximately million under the line as of december   the amended terms would represent increased interest expense  including the monitoring fee  of approximately  per year 
based on the increased outstanding balance as well as the increased interest rate on the line effective in december  the rockridge note being outstanding for a full year in fiscal as compared to a portion of fiscal  an additional borrowing of  under the rockridge note on october   and potential further borrowings in fiscal in order to address our working capital deficit  we anticipate our interest expense during fiscal to be greater than it was in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our financial statements for the year ended september  reflect a net loss of approximately million  although cash provided by operations for that period was approximately  although we had cash of approximately  at september   our working capital was a deficit of approximately million at that date 
during the year ended september   we obtained financing from three primary sources i the line  collateralized by our accounts receivable  under which we borrowed approximately  net of repayments during the year  ii the rockridge note  collateralized by all our assets not pledged under the line  under which we borrowed approximately  net of repayments during the year and iii  in cash proceeds from our sale of series a preferred in december  net of subsequent redemptions 
the maximum allowable borrowing amount under the line is now million  subject to certain formulas with respect to the amount and aging of the underlying receivables 
the outstanding balance approximately million as of december  bears interest at per annum  adjustable based on changes in prime after december   plus a weekly monitoring fee of one twentieth of a percent of the borrowing limit 
the outstanding principal under the line may be repaid at any time  but no later than december  which term may be extended by us for an extra year  subject to compliance with all loan terms  including no material adverse change  as well as concurrence of the lender 
we have not been in compliance with certain loan covenants through june   although the lender has granted waivers through that date 
in december the lender agreed that i we are not required to comply with the debt service coverage covenant for the quarter ended september  and the next compliance date for this covenant will be september  and ii effective for the quarter ended september   we are no longer required to comply with the minimum tangible net worth covenant 
during fiscal we borrowed million from rockridge capital holdings  llc rockridge  an entity controlled by one of our largest shareholders  in accordance with the terms of a note and stock purchase agreement that we entered into with rockridge dated april  and amended on september  we received another  under the note and stock purchase agreement on october   resulting in cumulative allowable borrowings of million 
in connection with this transaction  we issued a note the rockridge note  which is secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets  such lien subordinated only to the extent higher priority liens on assets  primarily accounts receivable and certain designated software and equipment  are held by certain of our other lenders 
we also entered into a security agreement with rockridge that contains certain covenants and other restrictions with respect to the collateral 
the rockridge note is repayable in equal monthly installments of  extending through august  the maturity date  which installments include principal except for a  balloon payable at the maturity date and which balloon payment is also convertible into restricted onsm common shares under certain circumstances plus interest at per annum on the remaining unpaid balance 
upon notice from rockridge at any time after september  and prior to the maturity date  up to fifty percent of the outstanding principal amount of the rockridge note excluding the balloon payment subject to conversion per the previous sentence may be converted into a number of restricted shares of onsm common stock 
if we sell all or substantially all of our assets  or at any time after september  and prior to the maturity date  the remaining outstanding principal amount of the rockridge note may be converted by rockridge into a number of restricted shares of onsm common stock 
the note and stock purchase agreement also provides that rockridge may receive an origination fee of  restricted onsm common shares 
the value of those shares is subject to a limited guaranty of no more than an additional payment by us of  which will be effective in the event the shares are sold for an average share price less than the minimum of per share 
the above conversions are subject to a minimum of one month between conversion notices unless such conversion amount exceeds  and will use a conversion price of eighty percent of the fair market value of the average closing bid price for onsm common stock for the twenty days of trading on the nasdaq capital market or such other exchange or market on which onsm common shares are trading prior to such rockridge notice  but such conversion price will not be less than per share 
we prepaid the dividends on all initially issued shares of series a  stated value through the date of the automatic conversion to onsm common shares december  
in accordance with the terms of the series a  at any time after june  until it automatically converts to onsm common shares on december   the holders may require us  to the extent legally permitted  to redeem up to  shares  stated value of the series a shares 
on april   we entered into a redemption agreement with one of the holders of the series a  under which the holder redeemed  shares of series a in exchange for our payment of  on april  accordingly  until december   we may be required to redeem up to another  series a shares by the other holder 
during december  we received funding commitment letters executed by three entities agreeing to provide us  within twenty days after our notice given on or before december   aggregate cash funding of  the funding under the commitment letters would be in exchange for our equity under mutually agreeable terms to be negotiated at the time of funding  or in the event such terms could not be reached  in the form of repayable debt 
terms of the repayable debt would also be subject to negotiation at the time of funding  provided that the debt i would be unsecured and subordinated to the company s other debts  ii would be subject to approval by our other creditors having the right of such pre approval  iii would provide for no principal or interest payments in cash prior to december   although  at our option  consideration may be given in the form of equity issued before that date and iv would provide that any cash repayment of principal after that date would be in equal monthly installments over at least one year but no greater than four years 
the rate of return on such debt  including cash and equity consideration given  would be negotiable based on market values at the time of funding but in any event would be not be greater than i a cash coupon rate of fifteen percent per annum and a ii total effective interest rate of thirty percent per annum such rate including the cash coupon rate plus the fair value of our shares given and or the black scholes valuation of debt conversion features and or issuance of options and or warrants 
as consideration for these commitment letters  the issuing entities will receive an aggregate of seventy five thousand  unregistered shares 
we are currently obligated under convertible equipment notes with a face value of million which are collateralized by specifically designated software and equipment owned by us with a cost basis of approximately million  as well as a subordinated lien on certain other of our assets to the extent that the designated software and equipment  or other software and equipment added to the collateral at a later date  is not considered sufficient security for the loan 
interest is payable every months in cash or  at our option  in restricted onsm common shares  based on a conversion price equal to seventy five percent of the average onsm closing price for the thirty trading days prior to the date the applicable payment is due 
on november   we elected to issue  unregistered shares of our common stock to the investors in lieu of  cash interest on these equipment notes for the period from may through october  which was recorded as interest expense of  on our books  based on the fair value of those shares on the issuance date 
the next interest due date is april  and the principal is not due before june the equipment notes may be converted to restricted onsm common shares at any time prior to their maturity date  at the holder s option  based on a conversion price equal to seventy five percent of the average onsm closing price for the thirty trading days prior to the date of conversion  but in no event may the conversion price be less than per share 
in the event the notes are converted prior to maturity june   interest on the equipment notes for the remaining unexpired loan period will be due and payable in additional restricted onsm common shares in accordance with the same formula for interest as described above 
we are also obligated under capital leases i a capital lease for audio conferencing equipment payable in equal monthly payments of  through august  which includes interest at approximately per annum  plus an optional final payment based on fair value  but not to exceed  and ii a capital lease for telephone equipment payable in equal monthly payments of through january  which includes interest at approximately per annum 
projected capital expenditures for the twelve months ended september  total approximately million which includes software development and hardware upgrades to the dmsp  the webcasting system including iencode  the audio and web conferencing infrastructure and software development and hardware costs in connection with the marketplace platform 
this total includes the payment of approximately  reflected by us as accounts payable at september  which will not be reflected as capital expenditures in our cash flow statement until paid 
this total also includes at least  of projected capital expenditures which we have determined may be financed  deferred past the twelve month period or cancelled entirely  depending on our other cash flow considerations 
in addition  approximately  of the narrowstep acquisition costs first deferred and then written off by us through september  are included in accounts payable at that date and will not be reflected as capital expenditures in our cash flow statement until paid 
on march   we terminated the merger agreement for the acquisition of narrowstep  which merger agreement we had first entered into on may  and then was amended twice on august  and on september  
the merger agreement could be terminated by either onstream or narrowstep at any time after november  provided that the terminating party was not responsible for the delay 
on march   we terminated the merger agreement and the acquisition of narrowstep 
on december   narrowstep filed a complaint against us in the court of chancery of the state of delaware  alleging breach of contract  fraud and three additional counts and seeking i million in damages  ii reimbursement of an unspecified amount for all of its costs associated with the negotiation and drafting of the merger agreement  including but not limited to attorney and consulting fees  iii the return of narrowstep s equipment alleged to be in our possession  iv reimbursement of an unspecified amount for all of its attorneys fees  costs and interest associated with this action and v any further relief determined as fair by the court 
after reviewing the complaint document  we determined that narrowstep has no basis in fact or in law for any claim and accordingly  this matter has not been reflected as a liability on our financial statements 
on december   we were served with a summons and we intend to file the required response on or before the required deadline and to vigorously defend against all claims 
furthermore  we do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  we were sued for breach of contract for legal services allegedly rendered to us in the amount of approximately  we have accrued approximately  related to this matter on our financial statements as of june  and believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  we received a letter from the vendor of certain software used in our smart encoding division  stating that the related licenses would be terminated if payment of approximately   of which is accrued as a liability on our june  balance sheet was not made by september  and that our obligation to pay this amount would not be affected by such license termination 
we believe that the termination of these licenses would not have a material effect on our ongoing operations and furthermore believe that we have meritorious defenses supporting our lack of payment to date  including product performance and integration issues 
during february  we took actions to reduce our operating costs  primarily personnel related  by approximately  per month 
during october  we took additional actions to reduce our operating costs  primarily personnel related  by another approximately  per month 
we recently began to identify and implement certain infrastructure related cost savings  which actions we expect will reduce our operating costs cost of sales by another approximately  per month  once they are fully implemented by the end of fiscal we have estimated that  based on the above reductions in our expenditure levels  we will require an approximately increase in our consolidated revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  in order to adequately fund our minimum anticipated expenditures including debt service and a basic level of capital expenditures through september  we have estimated that  in addition to this ongoing revenue increase  we will also require aggregate financing of approximately  funded over several months starting in january and in addition to the  loan proceeds received from rockridge in october to adequately address our current working capital deficit  to the extent past due vendor and other payments are believed by us to be necessary for us to continue our operations 
we have implemented specific actions  including hiring additional sales personnel  developing new products and initiating new marketing programs  geared towards achieving the above revenue increases 
the costs associated with these actions were contemplated in the above calculations 
however  in the event we are unable to achieve these revenue increases  we believe that a combination of identified decreases in our current level of expenditures that we would implement and the raising of additional capital in the form of debt and or equity that we believe we could obtain from identified sources including but not limited to the issuers of the funding commitment letters discussed above would be sufficient to allow us to operate through september  we will closely monitor our revenue and other business activity through the remainder of fiscal to determine if further cost reductions  the raising of additional capital or other activity is considered necessary 
effective december   our board of directors authorized the sale and issuance of up to  shares of series a convertible preferred stock series a 
on december   we filed a certificate of designation  preferences and rights for the series a with the florida secretary of state 
the series a has a coupon of per annum  an assigned value of per preferred share and a conversion rate of per common share 
series a dividends are cumulative and must be fully paid by us prior to the payment of any dividend on our common shares 
series a dividends are declared quarterly but are payable at the time of any conversion of a  in cash or at our option in the form of onsm common shares  using the greater of i per share or ii the average closing bid price of a common share for the five trading days immediately preceding the conversion 
any shares of series a that are still outstanding as of december  will automatically convert into onsm common shares 
series a may also be converted before that date at our option  provided that the closing bid price of our common shares has been at least per share  on each of the twenty trading days ending on the third business day prior to the date on which the notice of conversion is given 
series a is subordinate to series a but is senior to all other preferred share classes that may be issued by us 
except as explicitly required by applicable law  the holders of series a shall not be entitled to vote on any matters as to which holders of onsm common shares are entitled to vote 
holders of series a are not entitled to registration rights 
during august  ccj trust remitted  to us as a short term advance bearing interest at 
per day equivalent to approximately per annum until the date of repayment or unless the parties mutually agreed to another financing transaction s prior to repayment 
this advance was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our september  balance sheet 
on december   we entered into an agreement with ccj trust whereby accrued interest through that date of  was paid by us in cash and the  advance was converted to an unsecured subordinated note payable at a rate of interest per annum in equal monthly installments of principal and interest for months plus a  principal balloon at maturity 
the remaining principal balance of this note may be converted at any time into our common shares at the greater of i the previous day market value or ii per share 
in conjunction with and in consideration of this note transaction  the  shares of series a held by ccj trust at that date were exchanged for  shares of series a plus four year warrants for the purchase of  onsm common shares at per share 
our accumulated deficit was approximately million at september  we have incurred losses since our inception and our operations have been financed primarily through the issuance of equity and debt 
cash used for operations will be affected by numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  our ability to successfully market and sell the dmsp  iencode and marketplace  market our other existing products and services  the degree to which competitive products and services are introduced to the market  and our ability to control overhead expenses as we grow 
other than working capital which may become available to us from further borrowing or sales of equity including but not limited to proceeds from the funding commitment letters as discussed above  we do not presently have any additional sources of working capital other than cash on hand and cash  if any  generated from operations 
there are no assurances whatsoever that the issuers of the funding commitment letters will be willing and or able to provide cash upon our request and or that we will be able to borrow further funds and or sell the unissued portion of the authorized series a or other forms of equity or that we will increase our revenues and or control our expenses to a level sufficient to provide positive cash flow 
we cannot assure that our revenues will continue at their present levels  nor can we assure that they will not decrease 
as long as our cash flow from sales remains insufficient to completely fund operating expenses  financing costs and capital expenditures  we will continue depleting our cash and other financial resources 
as a result of the uncertainty as to our available working capital over the upcoming months  we may be required to delay or cancel certain of the projected capital expenditures  some of the planned marketing expenditures  or other planned expenses 
in addition  it is possible that we will need to seek additional capital through equity and or debt financing 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt  this will result in increased interest expense 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution 
there can be no assurance that acceptable financing  if needed to fund our ongoing operations  can be obtained on suitable terms  if at all 
our ability to continue our existing operations and or to continue to implement our growth strategy could suffer if we are unable to raise additional funds on acceptable terms  which will have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
cash provided by operating activities was approximately  for the year ended september   as compared to approximately  provided by operations for the prior fiscal year 
the  reflects our net loss of approximately million  reduced by approximately million of non cash expenses included in that loss as well as by approximately million arising from a net decrease in non cash working capital items during the period 
the decrease in non cash working capital items for the year ended september  is primarily due to an approximately  increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
this compares to a net decrease in non cash working capital items of approximately  for the prior fiscal year 
the primary non cash expenses included in our loss for the year ended september  were million arising from a charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  million of depreciation and amortization  approximately million of employee compensation expense arising from the issuance of stock and options  an approximately  write off of deferred acquisition costs and approximately  of amortization of deferred professional fee expenses paid for by issuing stock and options 
the primary sources of cash inflows from operations are from receivables collected from sales to customers 
future cash inflows from sales are subject to our pricing and ability to procure business at existing market conditions 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to approximately million for the prior fiscal year 
current and prior period investing activities primarily related to the acquisition of property and equipment  although the current period also included approximately  of narrowstep acquisition costs that were included in the  write off of such costs recorded during fiscal cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for the year ended september  as compared to approximately million for the prior fiscal year 
current and prior period financing activities primarily related to net proceeds from notes payable and convertible debentures  net of repayments 
the current period also included proceeds from the sale of a preferred shares  net of redemptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and our significant accounting policies are described in note to those statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
our assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the management s most subjective judgments 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described as follows 
our prior acquisitions of several businesses  including the onstream merger and the infinite merger  have resulted in significant increases in goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other unamortized intangible assets  which include acquired customer lists  were approximately million at september   representing approximately of our total assets and of the book value of shareholder equity 
in addition  property and equipment as of september  includes approximately  net of depreciation related to the dmsp 
in accordance with gaap  we periodically test these assets for potential impairment 
as part of our testing  we rely on both historical operating performance as well as anticipated future operating performance of the entities that have generated these intangibles 
factors that could indicate potential impairment include a significant change in projected operating results and cash flow  a new technology developed and other external market factors that may affect our customer base 
we will continue to monitor our intangible assets and our overall business environment 
if there is a material adverse and ongoing change in our business operations or if an adverse change initially considered temporary is determined to be ongoing  the value of our intangible assets  including those of our dmsp or infinite divisions  could decrease significantly 
in the event that it is determined that we will be unable to successfully market or sell our dmsp or audio and web conferencing services  an impairment charge to our statement of operations could result 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets  although not requiring any additional cash outlay  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we follow a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment and described above  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment  including a comparison and reconciliation of the carrying value of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization  after appropriate adjustments for control premium and other considerations 
if our market capitalization  after appropriate adjustments for control premium and other considerations  is determined to be less than our net book value ie  stockholders equity as reflected in our financial statements  that condition might indicate an impairment requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets  although not requiring any additional cash outlay  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we will closely monitor and evaluate all such factors as of december  and subsequent periods  in order to determine whether to record future non cash impairment charges
