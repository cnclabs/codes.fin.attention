item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview cybersource corporation provides electronic payment and risk management solutions 
cybersource solutions enable electronic payment processing for web  call center  and point of sale environments 
we partner with and connect to a large network of payment processors and other payment service providers to offer merchants a single source solution that simplifies electronic payment management 
our payment solutions allow ecommerce merchants to accept a wide range of online payment options  from credit cards and electronic checks  to global payment options and emerging payment types 
we also offer industry leading risk management solutions to help online merchants address complexities such as credit card fraud  online tax requirements  and export controls 
our professional services help to design  integrate  and optimize commerce transaction processing systems for merchants 
we primarily derive our revenues from monthly commerce transaction processing fees and global acquiring fees  and support service fees 
transaction and global acquiring revenues are recognized in the period in which the transactions occur and support service fees are recognized as the related services are provided and costs are incurred 
on november   the company acquired authorize 
net holdings  inc authorize 
net  a provider of products and services primarily for business that sell products and services online 
the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   includes revenues and expenses of authorize 
net for the period from november   the date of acquisition  to december  critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we derive a significant portion of our transaction processing revenues from global acquiring fees charged to merchants for payment processing services 
our fees  which are primarily a percentage of the dollar amount of each transaction processed  are based upon the merchant s monthly charge volume and risk profile 
in addition  we record revenues for miscellaneous services related to global acquiring  such as fees for processing credit card chargebacks 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  we recognize these fees on a gross basis as we are the primary agent in the transaction in the period the merchants transactions are processed 
related interchange fees paid to card issuing banks and assessments paid to credit card associations are recognized in cost of revenues at that time 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments as well as for potential sales returns 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these estimates are based on historical bad debt experience and other known factors 
if the historical data we used to determine these estimates does not properly reflect future losses  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents reserve for merchant losses we have potential liability for certain transactions processed through our global acquiring services if the payments associated with such transactions are rejected  refused  or returned for reasons such as consumer fraud or billing disputes 
for instance  if a billing dispute between a merchant and payer is not ultimately resolved in favor of the merchant  the disputed transaction may be charged back to the merchant s bank and credited to the payer s account 
if the charged back amount cannot be recovered from the merchant s account  or if the merchant refuses or is financially unable to reimburse its bank for the charged back amount  we may bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the payer s bank 
we could also incur fraud losses as a result of merchant fraud 
merchant fraud occurs when a merchant  rather than a customer  intentionally uses a stolen or counterfeit card  card number  or other bank account number to process a false sales transaction  or knowingly fails to deliver merchandise or services in an otherwise valid transaction 
we may be responsible for any losses for certain transactions if we are unable to collect from the merchant 
we evaluate the merchant s risk for potential losses based on historical experience and other relevant factors and record a loss reserve accordingly 
if the data we use to determine potential losses does not properly reflect future losses  additional reserves may be required 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accruals required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we do not believe our current proceedings will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or as a result of the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions to forecast federal  state  and international operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage our business 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million 
this benefit included a million reduction of our remaining valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets as we have determined that these assets will more likely than not be realized 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
total stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december   and was  million and million  respectively  before income taxes 
as of december   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock options was approximately million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we used the black scholes option valuation model to estimate stock based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and we will recognize the expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 

table of contents long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that we perform tests for impairment of our goodwill annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of authorize 
net with a carrying value of approximately million 
significant judgments could be required to evaluate goodwill for impairment in the future including the determination of reporting units  estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
we evaluate the goodwill related to the authorize 
net acquisition on an annual basis as of july statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas requires that we perform tests for impairment of our intangible assets subject to amortization annually and more frequently whenever events or circumstances suggest that our intangible assets may be impaired 
we evaluate the intangible assets related to the authorize 
net acquisition on an annual basis as of july as of december   we had recorded intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of authorize 
net  with a carrying value of approximately million  consisting of partner contracts and related relationships  merchant contracts and related relationships  existing technology  trade name and processor relationships 
the value of the partner contracts and related relationships as well as the merchant contracts and related relationships were derived by considering  among other factors  the expected income and discounted cash flows to be generated from such contracts and relationships 
the value of the existing technology was derived by considering  among other factors  the expected income and discounted cash flows to be generated  taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology and assessments of the life cycle state of the technology 
the value of the trade name was derived by considering  among other factors  expected income and discounted cash flows to be generated  also taking into account the expected period in which the company intends to utilize the trade name 
the value of the processor relationships was derived by considering the expected cost that would be incurred to establish and build connections with the processors 
to evaluate potential impairment  sfas and sfas require us to assess whether the estimated fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets are greater than their carrying value at the time of the test 
accordingly  there could be significant judgment in determining the fair values attributable to our goodwill and intangible assets  including the determination of reporting units  estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
as we are required to periodically evaluate our goodwill and intangible asset balances for impairment  if we incur impairments to our intangible assets  it would have an adverse impact on our future earnings

net purchases of equipment repurchases of common stock we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the level of investment we make in new businesses  new products or new technologies 
we currently have no agreements or understandings with respect to any future investments or acquisitions 
to the extent that our existing cash resources and future earnings are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing

recent pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the impact of adopting sfas r will be dependent on the future business combinations that we may pursue 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we provide our services to customers primarily in the united states and  to a lesser extent  in europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
the majority of sales are currently made in us dollars or pounds sterling 
a strengthening of the dollar or the pound sterling could make our products less competitive in foreign 
table of contents markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we also have non functional currency cash balances that are exposed to foreign currency risk 
for example  a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at december  would result in an approximate million decrease in our cash balances 
currently  we do not have any arrangements to hedge against the effects of currency fluctuations 
all of our cash equivalents are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
we generally invest our excess cash in money market funds 
due to the nature of our cash equivalents  which are money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure
