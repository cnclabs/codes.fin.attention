the company moody s is a provider of i credit ratings and related research  data and analytical tools  ii quantitative credit risk measures  risk scoring software and credit portfolio management solutions and iii software for fixed income pricing data and valuation models 
moody s operates in two reportable segments mis and ma 
mis  the credit rating agency  publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide 
revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors 
the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets 
these offerings include quantitative credit risk scores  credit processing software  economic research  analytical models  financial data  securities pricing and valuation services  and specialized consulting services 
ma also distributes investor oriented research and data developed by mis as part of its rating process  including in depth research on major debt issuers  industry studies  and commentary on topical credit related events 
beginning in january  moody s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august as a result of the reorganization  the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned 
all of moody s other non rating commercial activities  including mkmv and sales of research produced by mis analysts and the production and sales of other products and services  are represented in the ma segment 
as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs 
sovereign and sub sovereign ratings  which were previously part of financial institutions  infrastructure utilities ratings  which were previously part of corporate finance  and project finance  which was previously part of structured finance  were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public  project and infrastructure finance 
in addition  real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business 
furthermore  in august the global managed investments ratings group  previously part of the structured finance business  was combined with the financial institutions business 
within ma  various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions  software and consulting businesses 
the subscriptions business includes credit and economic research  data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis  the software business includes license and maintenance fees for credit risk  securities pricing and valuation software products  and the consulting business includes professional services and credit training associated with risk modeling  credit scorecard development  and other specialized analytical projects  as well as credit education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis 
subscription services are typically sold for an initial month term  with renewal features for subsequent annual periods 
the following is a discussion of the results of operations of these segments  excluding the intersegment royalty revenue for mis and expense charged to ma for the rights to use and distribute content  data and products developed by mis 
additionally  overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company are allocated to each segment based on a revenue split methodology 
overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy  information technology and support staff such as finance  human resource  information technology and legal 
in addition to its reported results  moody s has included in this md a certain adjusted results that the sec defines as non gaap financial measures 
management believes that such non gaap financial measures  when read in conjunction with the company s reported results  can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the company s performance 
these non gaap financial measures relate to legacy tax matters and adjustments made to the company s restructuring plan  further described in note and note  respectively  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
moody s annual report financials 
table of contents certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
critical accounting estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  contingencies  goodwill and intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings  mis uses judgments to allocate billed revenue between the initial assignment of ratings and the future monitoring of ratings in cases where mis does not charge ongoing monitoring fees for a particular issuer 
these judgments are not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties  but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods 
in such cases  mis defers portions of rating fees that it estimates will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated monitoring periods 
the portion of the revenue to be deferred is based upon a number of factors  including the estimated fair market value of the monitoring services charged for similar securities or issuers 
the monitoring period over which the deferred revenue will be recognized is determined based on factors such as the estimated lives of the rated securities 
currently  the estimated monitoring periods range from one to ten years 
at december   and  deferred revenue included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to such monitoring fees 
additionally  in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities  derivatives  international residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities  issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront 
these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods  ranging from three to years  which are based on the expected lives of the rated securities at december  at december   and  deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available 
the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data 
at december   and  accounts receivable included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
revenue earned within the ma segment relating to the three lines of business are recognized as follows subscription based revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period which is typically for an initial month term with renewal features for subsequent annual periods  beginning upon delivery of the initial product  software revenue is recognized at time of delivery which is considered to have occurred upon transfer of the product master or first copy 
if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service  revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs  consulting revenue is generally recognized at the time services are performed 
certain revenue arrangements within the ma segment include multiple elements such as software licenses  maintenance  subscription fees and professional services 
in these types of arrangements  the fee is allocated to the various products or services based on objective measurements of fair value  that is  generally the price charged when sold separately or vendor specific objective evidence 
moody s annual report financials 
table of contents accounts receivable allowance moody s records provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue  based on historical experience and current conditions 
such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
additionally  estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
billing adjustments and uncollectible account write offs are recorded against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current status of customer accounts 
moody s also considers the economic environment of the customers  both from an industry and geographic perspective  in evaluating the need for allowances 
based on its analysis  moody s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances 
this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts 
accordingly  moody s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions 
however  significant changes in any of the above factors  or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could result in amounts that are greater or less than estimates 
in each of  and  the company revised its provision rates for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate accounts receivable allowance 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this md a  commencing on page is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may  in the future  adjust its associated liabilities 
based on its review of the latest information available  and subject to the contingencies described in item md a contingencies  the ultimate monetary liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on moody s future reported results and financial position 
for the years ended december   and  the provision for income taxes reflected credits of million  million and million  respectively  due to changes in the company s liabilities for legacy tax exposures that were assumed by moody s in connection with its separation from old d b in october these tax matters are more fully described under the caption legacy tax matters within item  md a 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets moody s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  annually as of november th or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
as of the impairment test  the reporting units were determined to be mis  ma and fermat 
to test goodwill for impairment the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill and if the fair value exceeds its carrying value then goodwill is not impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value exceeds the carrying value then goodwill is not impaired  otherwise  an impairment loss will be recorded by the amount the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value 
the company allocates corporate items to the carrying value of the reporting unit based on the same methodology as corporate and overhead expenses are allocated 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit  which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans  expected long term growth rates  terminal values  discount rates  determination of moody s weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit  and an impairment charge may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which charge could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
moody s allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination 
the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis 
moody s annual report financials 
table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
restructuring the company has engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee benefit costs  contract termination costs and asset impairments 
if the actual amounts differ from these estimates  the amount of the restructuring charge could be impacted 
for a full description of moody s restructuring actions  refer to the results of operations section below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other post retirement benefits the expenses  assets and liabilities that moody s reports for its pension and other post retirement benefit plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances 
these assumptions include the following future compensation increases  based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets  based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments future healthcare cost trends  based on historical market data  near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates  based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds the discount rate selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations as of december  was derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares the plans projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve 
the cash flows are then discounted back to their present value and an overall discount rate is determined 
moody s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses  assets and liabilities related to the company s post retirement plans 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise 
to the extent the total outstanding gain or loss exceeds a corridor threshold as defined in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and the excess is subject to amortization in annual expense over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants 
for moody s post retirement plans  the total losses as of december  that have not been recognized in annual expense are million  and moody s expects to recognize in net periodic pension expense million for the amortization of actuarial losses 
for moody s funded pension plan  the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense 
as permitted under sfas no 
 the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization 
as of december   the company has an unrecognized asset loss of million  of which million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of expense 
moody s annual report financials 
table of contents the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody s operating income 
these effects have been calculated using the company s current projections of expenses  assets and liabilities related to moody s post retirement plans  which could change as updated data becomes available 
assumption used for estimated impact on operating income decrease increase discount rate weighted average assumed compensation growth rate assumed long term rate of return on pension assets discount rates of and are used for pension plans and other post retirement plans  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect projected expenses 
based on current projections  the company estimates that expenses related to post retirement plans will be million in compared with million in  excluding the costs of curtailment and special termination benefits of million in the expected expense increase in reflects the effects of lower discount rates  higher amortization of actuarial losses  and higher loss on plan assets 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments 
under this pronouncement  companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
some of the assumptions and estimates  such as share price volatility and expected option holding period  are based in part on moody s experience during the period since becoming a public company  which is limited 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 
an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in dollars in millions assumption used for grants increase in assumption estimated impact on operating income in increase decrease average expected dividend yield average expected share price volatility expected option holding period years year income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
the company s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as inter company transactions 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
therefore  income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes  and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 
moody s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters 
the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of its fin tax liabilities 
on january   upon the implementation of fin  the company implemented the accounting policy to classify interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company s consolidated financial statements and to classify associated penalties  if any  as part of other non operating expenses 
prior to the implementation of fin  the company had classified interest related to income taxes and associated penalties as components of income tax expense 
in accordance with fin  prior period financial statements have not been reclassified for this change 
moody s annual report financials 
table of contents fin requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date  assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 
upon the initial implementation of fin  the company recorded a reduction of its january  retained earnings of million  which is comprised of million of tax and accrued interest of million million  net of tax 
as the determination of fin liabilities and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company  there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits  and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company s operating results or financial condition 
other estimates in addition  there are other accounting estimates within moody s consolidated financial statements  including recoverability of deferred tax assets  anticipated dividend distributions from non us subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody s

contingencies from time to time  moody s is involved in legal and tax proceedings  governmental investigations  claims and litigation that are incidental to the company s business  including claims based on ratings assigned by mis 
moody s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business 
management periodically assesses the company s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available

as a result of recent events in the us subprime residential mortgage sector and the credit markets more broadly  various legislative  regulatory and enforcement entities around the world are investigating or evaluating the role of rating agencies in the us subprime mortgage backed securitization market and structured finance markets more generally 
moody s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and other governmental authorities and is cooperating with such investigations and inquiries 
moody s is also cooperating with a review by the sec relating to errors in the model used by mis to rate certain constant proportion debt obligations 
in addition  the company is facing market participant litigation relating to the performance of mis rated securities 
although moody s in the normal course experiences such litigation  the volume and cost of defending such litigation has significantly increased in the current economic environment

the cases have been consolidated and plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in november the company removed the consolidated action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york in december in january  the plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the supreme court of the state of new york 
the company will oppose remand and expects to move to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint upon resolution of the remand motion 
on october   the louisiana municipal police employees retirement system  a purported shareholder of the company s securities  also filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and certain officers  and the company as a nominal defendant  in the us district court for the southern district of new york

on december   rena nadoff  a purported shareholder of the company  filed a shareholder derivative complaint on behalf of the company against its directors and its ceo  and the company as a nominal defendant  in the supreme court of the state of new york

two purported class action complaints have been filed by purported purchasers of the company s securities against the company and certain of its senior officers  asserting claims under the federal securities laws 
the first was filed by raphael nach in the us district court for the northern district of illinois on july  the second was filed by teamsters local pension trust fund in the us district court for the southern district of new york on september  both actions have been consolidated moody s annual report financials 
table of contents into a single proceeding entitled in re moody s corporation securities litigation in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
on june   a consolidated amended complaint was filed  purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of the company s securities during the period february  through october  plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false and or misleading statements concerning the company s business conduct  business prospects  business conditions and financial results relating primarily to mis s ratings of structured finance products including rmbs  cdo and constant proportion debt obligations 
the plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages and their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the case 
the company moved for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint in september on february   the court issued an opinion dismissing certain claims  sustaining others and granting plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint by march  for claims  litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes  where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company has recorded liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate 
in other instances  because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss  management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant 
as additional information becomes available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly 
for income tax matters  the company employs the prescribed methodology of fin implemented as of january  which requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date  assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 
the company cannot predict the ultimate impact that any of the legislative  regulatory  enforcement or litigation matters may have on how its business is conducted and thus its competitive position  financial position or results of operations 
based on its review of the latest information available  in the opinion of management  the ultimate monetary liability of the company for the pending matters referred to above other than the legacy tax matters that are discussed below is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  although it is possible that the effect could be material to the company s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period 
legacy tax matters moody s continues to have exposure to certain legacy tax matters 
the following description of the relationships among moody s  new d b and their predecessor entities is important in understanding the legacy tax matters 
in november  the dun bradstreet corporation separated into three separate public companies the dun bradstreet corporation  acnielsen corporation and cognizant corporation 
in june  the dun bradstreet corporation separated into two separate public companies old d b and rh donnelley corporation 
during  cognizant separated into two separate public companies ims health incorporated and nielsen media research  inc in september  old d b separated into two separate public companies new d b and moody s  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
old d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
old d b and its predecessors also entered into a series of agreements covering the sharing of any liabilities for payment of taxes  penalties and interest resulting from unfavorable irs determinations on certain tax matters  and certain other potential tax liabilities  all as described in such agreements 
further  in connection with the distribution and pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  new d b and moody s have agreed on the financial responsibility for any potential liabilities related to legacy tax matters 
settlement agreements were executed with the irs in regarding legacy tax matters for the years and as of december   the company continues to carry a liability of million with respect to these matters 
with respect to these settlement agreements  moody s and new d b believe that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements among the parties 
moody s and new d b paid these amounts to the irs on their behalf  and attempted to resolve this dispute with ims health and nmr 
as a result  moody s and new d b commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr in connection with the matter 
this matter was resolved during the third quarter of in favor of moody s and new d b  resulting in ims health and nmr having paid a total of million to moody s 
moody s and new d b may also commence an arbitration proceeding to collect amounts owed by ims health and nmr with respect to the matter 
moody s cannot predict the outcome of this matter with any certainty

table of contents amortization expense deductions this legacy tax matter  which was affected by developments in june and as further described below  involves a partnership transaction which resulted in amortization expense deductions on the tax returns of old d b since irs audits of old d b s and new d b s tax returns for the years through concluded in june without any disallowance of the amortization expense deductions  or any other adjustments to income related to this partnership transaction 
these audits resulted in the irs issuing the notices for other tax issues for the years aggregating million in tax and penalties  plus statutory interest of approximately million  which should be apportioned among moody s  new d b  ims health and nmr pursuant to the terms of the applicable separation agreements 
moody s share of this assessment was million including interest  net of tax 
in november  the irs assessed the tax and penalties and used a portion of the deposit discussed below to satisfy the assessment  together with interest 
the company believes it has meritorious grounds to challenge the irs s actions and is evaluating its alternatives to recover these amounts 
the absence of any tax deficiencies in the notices for the amortization expense deductions for the years through  combined with the expiration of the statute of limitations for through  for issues not assessed  resulted in moody s recording an earnings benefit of million in the second quarter of this is comprised of two components  as follows i a reversal of a tax liability of million related to the period from through the distribution date  reducing the provision for income taxes  and ii a reduction of accrued interest expense of million million  net of tax and an increase in other non operating income of million  relating to amounts due to new d b 
in june  the statute of limitations for new d b relating to the tax year expired 
as a result  in the second quarter of  moody s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of million million  net of tax and an increase in other non operating income of million  relating to amounts due to new d b 
on the distribution date  new d b paid moody s million for of certain anticipated future tax benefits of new d b through it is possible that irs audits of new d b for tax years after could result in income adjustments with respect to the amortization expense deductions of this partnership transaction 
in the event these tax benefits are not claimed or otherwise not realized by new d b  or there is an audit adjustment  moody s would be required  pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  to repay to new d b an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits and its share of any tax liability that new d b incurs 
as of december   moody s liability with respect to this matter totaled million 
in march  new d b and moody s each deposited million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the through tax years 
in july  new d b and moody s commenced procedures to recover approximately million of these deposits million for new d b and million for moody s  which represents the excess of the original deposits over the total of the deficiencies asserted in the notices 
as noted above  in november the irs used million of moody s portion of the deposit to satisfy an assessment and related interest 
additionally  in the first quarter of the irs returned to moody s million in connection with this matter  which includes million of interest 
in july  the irs paid moody s the remaining million balance of the original deposit  and in september the irs paid moody s million of interest on that balance 
at december   moody s has recorded liabilities for legacy tax matters totaling million 
this includes liabilities and accrued interest due to new d b arising from the distribution agreement 
it is possible that the ultimate liability for legacy tax matters could be greater than the liabilities recorded by the company  which could result in additional charges that may be material to moody s future reported results  financial position and cash flows
