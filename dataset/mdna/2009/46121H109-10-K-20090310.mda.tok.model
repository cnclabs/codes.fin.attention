table of contents hearing health intricon manufactures hybrid amplifiers and integrated circuit components hybrid amplifiers  along with faceplates for in the ear and in the canal hearing instruments 
intricon is a leading manufacturer and supplier of microminiature electromechanical components to hearing instrument manufacturers 
these components consist of volume controls  microphones  receivers  trimmer potentiometers and switches 
components are offered in a variety of sizes  colors and capacities in order to accommodate a hearing manufacturer s individualized specifications 
hearing instruments  which fit behind or in a person s ear to amplify and process sound for a hearing impaired person  generally are composed of four basic parts and several supplemental components for control or fitting purposes 
the four basic parts are microphones  amplifier circuits  miniature receivers speakers and batteries  all of which intricon manufactures  with the exception of the battery 
intricon s hybrid amplifiers are a type of amplifier circuit 
supplemental components include volume controls  trimmer potentiometers  which shape sound frequencies to respond to the particular nature of a person s hearing loss  and switches used to turn the instrument on and off and to go from telephone to normal speech modes 
faceplates and an ear shell  molded to fit the user s ear  often serve as housing for hearing instruments 
intricon manufactures its components on a short lead time basis in order to supply just in time delivery to its customers and  consequently  order backlog amounts are not meaningful 
using our ulp bodynet family technology  specifically nanodsp and our new wireless nanolink product family  intricon is building a new generation of affordable  high quality hearing aids and similar amplifier devices under contracts for oem s 
dsp devices have better clarity  attractive pricing points and an improved ability to filter out background noise 
during  we introduced ethos  our new high performance adaptive dsp hearing instrument amplifier 
in our view  ethos advanced capabilities are ideally suited for the hearing health market 
we believe the introduction of ethos solidifies our position as a leader of high performance adaptive dsp hearing instrument amplifiers 
furthermore  we believe our strategic alliance with dynamic hearing will allow us to develop new body worn applications and further expand both our hearing health and professional audio product portfolio 
overall  we believe the hearing health market holds significant opportunities for the company 
in the united states  europe and japan  the year old plus age demographic is the fastest growing segment of the population  and many of those individuals could  at some point  benefit from a hearing device that uses intricon s proprietary technology 
while it harbors great potential  the hearing health market is experiencing slowness due to macroeconomic conditions 
in general  the us market does not provide insurance reimbursement for hearing aid purchases 
people can defer their hearing aid purchase 
we believe the softness in the market will continue into reimbursement trends in europe are more favorable  with insurers and the governments covering more devices 
professional audio communications intricon entered the high quality audio communication device market in  and now has a line of miniature  professional audio headset products used by customers focusing on homeland security and emergency response needs 
the line includes several communication devices that are extremely portable and perform well in noisy or hazardous environments 
these products are well suited for applications in the fire  law enforcement  safety  aviation and military markets 
in addition  the company has a line of miniature ear and head worn devices used by performers and support staff in the music and stage performance markets 
our may acquisition of tibbett s industries provided the company access to homeland security agencies in this market 
we believe performance in difficult listening environments and wireless operations will continue to improve as these products increasingly include our proprietary nanodsp  wireless nanolink and ulp nanolink technology

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
if any of the risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of future operations could be materially adversely affected 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our results of operations  which could adversely affect us 
factors that affect our results of operations include  but are not limited to  the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the global economy and financial markets  changes in the mix of products sold  market acceptance of our products and our customer s products  competitive pricing pressures  global currency valuations  the availability of electronic components that we purchase from suppliers  our ability to meet demand  our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by our or our competitors  changing customer requirements  delays in new product qualifications  and the timing and extent of research and development expenses 
these factors have caused and may continue to cause us to experience fluctuations in operating results on a quarterly and or annual basis 
these fluctuations could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  which in turn  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are dependent on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues 
in fiscal year  our largest customer accounted for of our net sales and our five largest customers accounted for of our net sales 
a significant decrease in the sales to or loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our revenues are largely dependent upon the ability of customers to develop and sell products that incorporate our products 
no assurance can be given that our major customers will not experience financial  technical or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and  in turn  our results of operations 
we may not be able to collect outstanding accounts receivable from our customers 
some of our customers purchase our products on credit  which may cause a concentration of accounts receivable among some of our customers 
as of december   we had accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  of  which represented approximately percent of our shareholders equity as of that date 
as of that date  two customers accounted for approximately and percent of our accounts receivable  respectively 
our financial condition and profitability may be harmed if one or more of our customers are unable or unwilling to pay these accounts receivable when due 
if we are unable to continue to develop new products that are inexpensive to manufacture  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to continue to achieve our historical profit margins in our body worn device and electronic products segments due to advancements in technology 
the ability to continue our profit margins is dependent upon our ability to stay competitive by developing products that are technologically advanced and inexpensive to manufacture 
our need for continued investment in research and development may increase expenses and reduce our profitability 
our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
if we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the need to maintain or increase spending levels in this area and the difficulty in reducing costs associated with research and development  our operating results could be materially harmed if our research and development efforts fail to result in new products or if revenues fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of our commitment to invest in research and development  management expects that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues could increase in the future 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive business and if we are unable to be competitive  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
several of our competitors have been able to offer more standardized and less technologically advanced hearing products at lower prices 
price competition has had an adverse effect on our sales and margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance our technical capabilities or compete successfully with our existing and future competitors 
merger and acquisition activity in our hearing health market has resulted in a smaller customer base 
reliance on fewer customers may have an adverse effect on us 
several of our customers in the hearing health market have undergone mergers or acquisitions  resulting in a smaller customer base with larger customers 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with the reduced customer base  it may adversely affect our operating profits and revenue 
unfavorable legislation in the hearing health market may decrease the demand for our products  and may negatively impact our financial condition 
in some of our foreign markets  government subsidies cover a portion of the cost of hearing aids 
a change in legislation that would reduce or eliminate these subsidies could decrease the demand for our hearing health products 
this could result in an adverse effect on our operating results 
we are unable to predict the likelihood of any such legislation 
implementation of our growth strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase revenues 
our growth strategy includes developing new products and entering new markets  as well as identifying and integrating acquisitions 
our ability to compete in new markets will depend upon a number of factors including  among others our ability to create demand for products in new markets  our ability to manage growth effectively  our ability to successfully identify  complete and integrate acquisitions  our ability to respond to changes in our customers businesses by updating existing products and introducing  in a timely fashion  new products which meet the needs of our customers  the quality of our new products  and our ability to respond rapidly to technological change 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may face competition in these new markets from various companies that may have substantially greater research and development resources  marketing and financial resources  manufacturing capability and customer support organizations 
we operate in singapore and germany  and various factors relating to our international operations could affect our results of operations 
in  we operated in singapore and germany 
approximately percent of our revenues were derived from our facilities in these countries in as of december  approximately percent of our long lived assets are located in these countries 
political or economic instability in these countries could have an adverse impact on our results of operations due to diminished revenues in these countries 
our future revenues  costs of operations and profit results could be affected by a number of factors related to our international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in economic conditions from country to country  changes in a country s political condition  trade protection measures  licensing and other legal requirements and local tax issues 
unanticipated currency fluctuations in the euro could lead to lower reported consolidated revenues due to the translation of these currencies into us dollars when we consolidate our revenues 

table of contents we may explore acquisitions that complement or expand our business 
we may not be able to complete these transactions and these transactions  if executed  pose significant risks and may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we intend to explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement  enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities 
we may have difficulty finding these opportunities or  if we do identify these opportunities  we may not be able to complete the transactions for various reasons  including a failure to secure financing 
any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks  including the diversion of our management s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture  possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process  unanticipated liabilities  and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate  operate  maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt 
we may experience difficulty in paying our debt when it comes due  which could limit our ability to obtain financing 
as of december   we had bank indebtedness of  and additional indebtedness of  consisting of  payable to himpp and  payable to amecon 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by general economic conditions and by financial  competitive  political  business and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we believe that availability under our existing credit facility combined with funds expected to be generated from operations and control of capital spending will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operating needs for at least the next months 
if  however  we are unable to renew these facilities in the future or do not generate sufficient cash or complete such financings on a timely basis  we may be required to seek additional financing or sell equity on terms which may not be as favorable as we could have otherwise obtained 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing  additional borrowing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and equity capital markets  as well as our own financial condition 
our success depends on our senior management team and if we are not able to retain them  it could have a materially adverse effect on us 
we are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our senior management team  including mark s 
gorder  our president  chief executive officer and director 
we depend on the services of mr 
gorder and the other members of our senior management team to  among other things  continue the development and implementation of our business strategies and maintain and develop our client relationships 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our engineering and technical personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in our markets 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development and growth of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
the failure to retain and recruit key technical personnel could cause additional expense  potentially reduce the efficiency of our operations and could harm our business 

table of contents we and or our customers may be unable to protect our and their proprietary technology and intellectual property rights or keep up with that of competitors 
our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our markets depends  in part  on our ability and the ability of our customers to protect our and their current and future proprietary technology under patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and unfair competition laws 
we cannot assure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate  or that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around the proprietary rights we own or license 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs in attempting to protect our proprietary rights 
also  despite the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our and our customers products  develop similar technology independently or otherwise obtain and use information that we or our customers regard as proprietary 
we and our customers may be unable to successfully identify or prosecute unauthorized uses of our or our customers technology 
if we become subject to material intellectual property infringement claims  we could incur significant expenses and could be prevented from selling specific products 
we may become subject to material claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others in the future 
we cannot assure that  if made  these claims will not be successful 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim even if the claim is invalid  and could distract management from other business 
any judgment against us could require substantial payment in damages and could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering certain products 
environmental liability and compliance obligations may affect our operations and results 
our manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations as well as internal programs and policies governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the storage  use  handling  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances  wastes and chemicals  and employee health and safety 
if violations of environmental laws occur  we could be held liable for damages  penalties  fines and remedial actions 
our operations and results could be adversely affected by any material obligations arising from existing laws  as well as any required material modifications arising from new regulations that may be enacted in the future 
we may also be held liable for past disposal of hazardous substances generated by our business or former businesses or businesses we acquire 
in addition  it is possible that we may be held liable for contamination discovered at our present or former facilities 
we are subject to numerous asbestos related lawsuits  which could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we are a defendant along with a number of other parties in approximately lawsuits as of december   approximately lawsuits as of december  alleging that plaintiffs have or may have contracted asbestos related diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos products or equipment containing asbestos sold by one or more named defendants 
these lawsuits relate to the discontinued heat technologies segment which was sold in march due to the noninformative nature of the complaints  we do not know whether any of the complaints state valid claims against us 
certain insurance carriers have informed us that the primary policies for the period august   have been exhausted and that the carriers will no longer provide a defense under those policies 
we have requested that the carriers substantiate this situation 
we believe we have additional policies available for other years which have been ignored by the carriers 
because settlement payments are applied to all years a litigant was deemed to have been exposed to asbestos  we believe when settlement payments are applied to these additional policies  we will have availability under the years deemed exhausted 
if our insurance policies do not cover the costs and any awards for the asbestos related lawsuits  we will have to use our cash or obtain additional financing to pay the asbestos related obligations and settlement costs 
there is no assurance that we will have the cash or be able to obtain additional financings on favorable terms to pay asbestos related obligations or settlements should they occur 
the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty 
in light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos lawsuits  there is no guarantee that these lawsuits will not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile  which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell common stock when they want to and at prices they find attractive 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile  and there has been limited trading volume in the common stock 
the common stock market price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors operating results  the timing and announcement of sales or acquisitions of assets by us or our competitors  changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  adverse or unfavorable publicity about our services or us  the commencement of material litigation  or an unfavorable verdict  against us  terrorist attacks  war and threats of attacks and war  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of common stock 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
such volatility and decline has affected many companies irrespective of  or disproportionately to  the operating performance of these companies 
these broad fluctuations and limited trading volume may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  and your ability to sell our common stock 
most of our outstanding shares are available for resale in the public market without restriction 
the sale of a large number of these shares could adversely affect the share price and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities or make acquisitions for common stock 
anti takeover provisions may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change in control would be beneficial to shareholders 
we are a pennsylvania corporation 
anti takeover provisions in pennsylvania law and our charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if we are sold 
for example  our charter provides that the board of directors may issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 
in addition  our bylaws provide for a classified board  with each board member serving a staggered three year term 
directors may be removed by shareholders only with the approval of the holders of at least two thirds of all of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business  the trading price of our stock and our ability to retain our current customers or obtain new customers 
beginning in fiscal  we began a process to document and evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments

item legal proceedings the company is a defendant along with a number of other parties in approximately lawsuits as of december   approximately lawsuits as of december  alleging that plaintiffs have or may have contracted asbestos related diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos products or equipment containing asbestos sold by one or more named defendants 
these lawsuits relate to the discontinued heat technologies segment which was sold in march due to the noninformative nature of the complaints  the company does not know whether any of the complaints state valid claims against the company 
certain insurance carriers have informed the company that the primary policies for the period august   have been exhausted and that the carriers will no longer provide a defense under those policies 
the company has requested that the carriers substantiate this situation 
the company believes it has additional policies available for other years which have been ignored by the carriers 
because settlement payments are applied to all years a litigant was deemed to have been exposed to asbestos  the company believes when settlement payments are applied to these additional policies  the company will have availability under the years deemed exhausted 
the company does not believe that the asserted exhaustion of the primary insurance coverage for this period will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations 
management believes that the number of insurance carriers involved in the defense of the suits and the significant number of policy years and policy limits  to which these insurance carriers are insuring the company  make the ultimate disposition of these lawsuits not material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

new accounting pronouncements see new accounting pronouncements set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k  for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
certain accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their importance to the consolidated financial statements and possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly 
the accounting policies of the company with significant estimates and assumptions are described below 
revenue recognition our continuing operations recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
under contractual terms  shipments are generally fob shipment point 
customers have days to notify the company if the product is damaged or defective 
beyond that  there are no significant obligations that remain after shipping other than warranty obligations 
contracts with customers do not include product return rights  however  we may elect in certain circumstances to accept returns for product 
we record revenue for product sales net of returns 
net sales also include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling  if applicable 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of sales 
in general  we warrant our products to be free from defects in material and workmanship and will fully conform to and perform to specifications for a period of one year 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have experienced in the past 
accounts receivable reserves this reserve is an estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are uncollectible 
the reserve is based on a combination of specific customer knowledge  general economic conditions and historical trends 
management believes the results could be materially different if economic conditions change for our customers 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of our cost or market value 
market value is an estimate of the future net realizable value of our inventory 
it is based on historical trends  product life cycles  forecast of future inventory needs and on hand inventory levels 
management believes reserve levels could be materially affected by changes in technology  our customer base  customer needs  general economic conditions and the success of certain company sales programs 

table of contents discontinued operations we continuously assess the return on our business segments 
when management with the appropriate level of authority determines that a plan is in place to restructure the operations of a business or discontinue an operation  contractual commitments and obligations are recorded 
see the discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill we perform an annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill 
as part of this assessment  we estimate future cash flows  as well as making a risk assessment of investing in our company versus other investment opportunities 
changes in either the risk assessment or estimated future cash flows could have a material adverse impact on the carrying value of goodwill 
long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets is periodically assessed to insure their carrying value does not exceed their estimated net realizable future value 
this assessment includes certain assumptions related to future needs for the asset to help generate future cash flow 
changes in those assessments  future economic conditions or technological changes could have a material adverse impact on the carrying value of these assets 
deferred taxes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
actual future operating results  as well as changes in our future performance  could have a material adverse impact on the valuation reserves 
employee benefit obligations we provide retirement and health care insurance for certain domestic retirees and employees 
we measure the costs of our obligation based on our best estimate 
the net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the post retirement benefit 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
we determine assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the future rate of compensation increases 
the actuarial models also use assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
changes in actuarial assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events and different rates of retirement  mortality and withdrawal

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our consolidated cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign currency exchange rates through operational and financial market actions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
we manufacture and sell our products in a number of locations around the world  resulting in a diversified revenue and cost base that is exposed to fluctuations in european and asian currencies 
this diverse base of foreign currency revenues and costs serves to create a hedge that limits our net exposure to fluctuations in these foreign currencies 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are occasionally managed by financial market transactions  principally through the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of six months or less to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of the nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables relating to select contracts 
the decision by management to hedge any such transaction is made on a case by case basis 
foreign exchange forward contracts are denominated in the same currency as the receivable or payable being covered  and the term and amount of the forward foreign exchange contract substantially mirrors the term and amount of the underlying receivable or payable 
the receivables and payables being covered arise from bank debt  trade and intercompany transactions of and among our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   we did not have any forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
all assets and liabilities of foreign operations with foreign functional currency are translated into us dollars at prevailing rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using average rates of exchange for the year 
the functional currency of the company s german operations is the european euro 
as of january   the functional currency of the company s singapore operations changed from the singapore dollar to the us dollar 
adjustments resulting from the process of translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of tax  where appropriate 
foreign currency transaction amounts included in the statements of operation include losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
based on our results of operations  if foreign currency exchange rates were to strengthen weaken by against the us dollar  we would expect a resulting pre tax loss gain of approximately million 
for more information regarding foreign currency risks  see foreign currency fluctuation item on page of this annual report on form k 
interest rate risk at december   we had million in outstanding variable rate borrowings 
a material change in interest rates could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by  for each million of variable debt outstanding for the entire year 
based on our average variable rate borrowings outstanding in  a basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of  the company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps in managing its interest rate exposure 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
when entered into  the company formally designates the derivative financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure if such criteria are met  and documents both the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge 
the company formally assesses  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether the derivative financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposure 
because of the high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the derivative financial instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument s change in fair value would be immediately recognized in earnings 

table of contents the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges with the changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and as a derivative hedge asset or liability  as applicable 
the swaps settle periodically in arrears with the related amounts for the current settlement period payable to  or receivable from  the counter parties included in accrued liabilities or accounts receivable and recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense from the underlying debt to which the swap is designated 
during  approximately  of additional expense was recorded as a result of said adjustments 
during  ineffectiveness from such hedges was at december   the company had a united states dollar usd denominated interest rate swap outstanding which effectively fixed the interest rate on floating rate debt  exclusive of lender spreads  at for a notional principal amount of  through september the derivative net loss on this contract recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  was  which is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings over the next months  the life of the agreement
