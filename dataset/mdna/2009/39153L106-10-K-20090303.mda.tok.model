going forward  we expect the pace of acquisitions to be less than the level 
however  we will continue to pursue strategically targeted and opportunistic acquisitions 
our customers our products are designed to provide reliable  long lasting solutions that meet the evolving requirements and needs of our customers and the end users of their products 
the nature and extent of our selling relationships with each customer are different in terms of breadth of products purchased  purchased product volumes  length of contractual commitment  ordering patterns  inventory management and selling prices 
our imc customers include leading oems  such as biotronik  boston scientific  depuy  johnson johnson  medtronic  smith nephew  sorin group  st 
jude medical  stryker and zimmer 
during and in the first quarter of  we completed seven acquisitions in order to diversify our customer base and market concentration 
as a result  in boston scientific  medtronic and st 
jude medical collectively accounted for of our total sales  compared to in and our electrochem customers are primarily companies involved in energy  security  portable medical  environmental monitoring and more 
we have entered into long term supply agreements with some of those customers 
some of these customers include  general electric  halliburton company  pathfinder energy services and weatherford international 
financial overview we achieved sales of million for  an increase of over the previous year 
benefitted from our acquisitions in and which added approximately million of incremental revenue as well as organic growth of 
this included approximately million of revenue due to the additional week of sales in resulting from our fiscal year end falling in closest friday to december st 
during  we were extremely focused on the integration of our seven acquisitions from and this included the initiation and implementation of numerous cost savings and consolidation initiatives  as well as leveraging the diversified revenue base that we acquired to drive improved operating performance 
our diluted earnings per share for totaled compared to for results were reduced by per share of net charges and gains such as ipr d charges  non recurring acquisition related charges inventory step up amortization and charges related to our cost savings and consolidation initiatives partially offset by a debt extinguishment gain 
results were reduced by per share of similar charges  net of gains 
we completed five acquisitions in and two in the first two months of these acquisitions were enabled by our strong cash position and the financing we put in place during the first half of as of january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of long term debt 
payment on million of this debt is due in june with the remaining debt due in and for  we generated million of cash flow from operations compared to million in  an increase of 
product development currently  we are developing a series of new products for customer applications in the crm  neuromodulation  vascular access  orthopedics and commercial markets 
some of the key development initiatives include continue the evolution of our q series high rate icd batteries  continue development of mri compatible product lines  integrate biomimetic coating technology with vascular access devices  complete design of next generation steerable catheters  advance minimally invasive surgical techniques for orthopedics industry  develop disposable instrumentation  provide wireless sensing solutions to commercial customers  and develop a charging platform for commercial secondary offering 
in may  we announced the execution of a letter of intent in which the sorin group will leverage our mri technology in their future crm devices 
at the same time we continue to explore and develop similar relationships with other customers in both the crm and neuromodulation space 
mri compatible components are just one example of our strategy to continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers that improve the functionality  safety  and efficiency of their products 
approximately million of the biomec purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of acquired ipr d projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
the value assigned to ipr d relates to projects that incorporate biomec s novel polymer coating biomimetic technology that mimics the surface of endothelial cells of blood vessels 
an agreement was reached in with an oem partner to provide coating material and services for their catheter products 
testing was conducted to support this application  and a k was submitted to the food and drug administration fda in december requesting clearance to market this product 
we expect approval of this k in early  with product sales to commence following this clearance 
there were no significant changes from our original estimates with regard to these projects during approximately million of the enpath purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of acquired ipr d projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
these projects primarily represent the next generation of introducer and catheter products already being sold by enpath which incorporate new enhancements and customer modifications 
one introducer project was launched near the end of we expect to commercially launch the other introducer products under development in which will replace existing products 
these introducer projects acquired have been delayed due to timing of customer adoption and transition and technical difficulties of some of the projects 
additionally  future sales from our viasealtm introducer project have been enjoined due to litigation see litigation 
the catheter ipr d project  to which a portion of the enpath purchase price was allocated  has been put on hold indefinitely in order to allocate resources to other projects 
these delays in introducer and catheter projects are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
approximately million of the precimed purchase price was allocated to the preliminary estimated fair value of acquired ipr d projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the value assigned to ipr d related to reamer  instrument kit  locking plate and cutting guide projects 
these projects primarily represent the next generation of products already being sold by precimed which incorporate new enhancements and customer modifications 
we commercially launched a portion of these products in and expect to launch others in several of the other orthopedic projects acquired have been delayed and two have been cancelled due to the timing of customer adoption  technical difficulties  inability to meet margin goals and feasibility assessments 
these changes are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations as these projects were assumed to have lower margins 
cost savings and consolidation efforts from to  we recorded charges in other operating expenses related to our ongoing cost savings and consolidation efforts 
additional information is set forth in note other operating expenses of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
facility shutdowns and consolidations beginning in the first quarter of and ending in the second quarter of we consolidated our medical capacitor manufacturing operations in cheektowaga  ny  and our implantable medical battery manufacturing operations in clarence  ny  into our advanced power source manufacturing facility in alden  ny alden facility 
we also consolidated our capacitor research  development and engineering operations from our cheektowaga  ny facility into our technology center in clarence  ny 
in the first quarter of  we announced our intent to close our carson city  nv facility and consolidate the work performed at that facility into our tijuana  mexico facility 
this consolidation project was completed in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we announced our intent to close our columbia  md facility columbia facility and fremont  ca advanced research laboratory arl 
we also announced that the manufacturing operations at our columbia facility will be moved into our tijuana facility and that the research  development and engineering and product development functions at our columbia facility and at arl will relocate to our technology center in clarence  ny 
the arl portion of this consolidation project was completed in the fourth quarter of the columbia facility portion of this consolidation project was completed in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we completed a plan for consolidating our corporate and business unit organization structure 
a significant portion of the annual savings from this initiative was reinvested into research development activities and business growth opportunities 
the total cost of these projects was million  which was incurred from to  and included the following severance and retention million  production inefficiencies  moving and revalidation million  accelerated depreciation and asset write offs million  personnel million  and other million 
all categories of costs were considered to be cash expenditures  except accelerated depreciation and asset write offs 
approximately million of these expenses for the facility shutdowns and consolidations were included in the imc business segment  million in the electrochem segment and million was recorded in unallocated operating expenses 
facility shutdowns and consolidations in the first quarter of  we announced that we will close our current electrochem manufacturing facility in canton  ma and construct a new  square foot replacement facility in raynham  ma 
this initiative is not cost savings driven but capacity driven for the electrochem group 
in the second quarter of  we announced that we will consolidate our corporate offices in clarence  ny into our existing research and development center also in clarence  ny after an expansion of that facility was complete 
this expansion and relocation was completed in the third quarter of during the second and third quarters of  we reorganized and consolidated various general administrative and research development functions throughout the organization in order to optimize those resources with the businesses we acquired in and in the second half of  we ceased manufacturing at our facility in suzhou  china  which was acquired from eac  and closed our leased manufacturing facility in orchard park  ny  which was acquired from intellisensing 
additionally  we consolidated our saignelegier  switzerland manufacturing facility  which was acquired from precimed 
the operations of these facilities were relocated to existing facilities which have excess capacity 
the facility in china is expected to be used as a procurement office in in the fourth quarter of  we approved a plan for the closure of our teterboro  new jersey electrochem manufacturing  blaine  minnesota vascular access manufacturing and exton  pennsylvania orthopedics corporate office facilities 
the operations at these facilities will be moved to other existing facilities with excess capacity 
the above initiatives are expected to be completed over the next twelve months 
the total cost for these facility shutdowns and consolidations is expected to be approximately million to million of which million has been incurred through january  the major categories of costs include the following severance and retention million to million  production inefficiencies  moving and revalidation million to million  accelerated depreciation and asset write offs million to million  personnel million to million  and other million to million 
as a result of our consolidation initiatives  during two facilities were determined to be impaired 
accordingly  these facilities  which had a carrying amount of million  were written down to their fair value of million 
this resulted in an impairment charge of million  which was included in other operating expense 
all categories of costs are considered to be cash expenditures  except accelerated depreciation and asset write offs 
for  costs of million are included in the imc business segment 
for and  costs of million and million  respectively  are included in the electrochem business segment 
the annual anticipated cost savings from these initiatives is estimated to be approximately million to million  and will not be fully realized until our critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our most critical accounting estimates are described below 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of variations of key assumptions used valuation of goodwill  other identifiable intangible assets and ipr d when we acquire a company  we allocate the purchase price to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair value at the date of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including ipr d 
other indefinite lived intangible assets  such as trademarks and tradenames  are considered non amortizing intangible assets as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill are required to be assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequent if certain indicators are present 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we base the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets including ipr d on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined using one of three valuation approaches market  income and cost 
the selection of a particular method for a given asset depends on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset  among other considerations 
the market approach values the subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets 
the income approach values the subject asset based on the present value of risk adjusted cash flows projected to be generated by the asset 
the projected cash flows for each asset considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  attrition trends  reasonable contract renewal assumptions from the perspective of a marketplace participant  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
the cost approach values the subject asset by determining the current cost of replacing that asset with another of equivalent economic utility 
the cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset  less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation or obsolescence  with specific consideration given to economic obsolescence if indicated 
we perform an annual review on the last day of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
we assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
fair values for reporting units are determined based primarily on the income approach  however where appropriate  the market approach or appraised values are also used 
definite lived intangible assets such as purchased technology  patents and customer lists are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
indefinite lived intangible assets such as trademarks and tradenames are evaluated for impairment by using the income approach 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations 
in arriving at the value of the ipr d  we additionally consider among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  commercial feasibility of the project  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the projected costs to complete  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the value of the assets and liabilities recorded which would change the amount and timing of future intangible asset amortization expense 
we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the determination of the expected future cash flows from our reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing 
these include sales growth  cost of capital  and projections of future cash flows 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could create future impairment losses to our goodwill 
for indefinite lived assets such as trademarks and tradenames  we make certain estimates of revenue streams  royalty rates and other future benefits 
significant changes in these estimates could create future impairments of these indefinite lived intangible assets 
estimation of the useful lives of definite lived intangible assets requires significant management judgment 
events could occur that would materially affect our estimates of the useful lives 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future amortization expense or could create future impairments of these definite lived intangible assets 
a change in the amortization of our intangible assets would increase decrease current year net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
as of january  we have million of intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 
this includes million of amortizing intangible assets  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of goodwill 
balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of variations of key assumptions used stock based compensation we record compensation costs related to our stock based awards in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  and related securities and exchange commission rules included in staff accounting bulletin no 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
compensation cost for service based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
compensation cost for performance based awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest 
we utilize the black scholes options pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options under sfas no 
r 
we are required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected black scholes model inputs  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the stock options 
the expected life of stock options granted  which represents the period of time that the stock options are expected to be outstanding  is based  primarily  on historical data 
the expected dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life 
for restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards  the fair market value is determined based upon the closing value of our stock price on the grant date 
compensation cost for performance based stock options and restricted stock units is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
that assessment is based upon our actual and expected future performance as well as that of the individuals who have been granted performance based awards 
stock based compensation expense is only recorded for those awards that are expected to vest 
forfeiture estimates for determining appropriate stock based compensation expense are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and demographic characteristics 
revisions are made to those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there are significant differences among valuation models 
this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved in selecting assumptions to be utilized to determine fair value and forfeiture assumptions 
if factors change and result in different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the expense that we record for future grants may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
additionally  changes in performance of the company or individuals who have been granted performance based awards that affect the likelihood that performance based targets are achieved could materially impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized 
a change in our stock based compensation expense would increase decrease current year net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of variations of key assumptions used inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
inventory standard costing requires complex calculations that include assumptions for overhead absorption  scrap  sample calculations  manufacturing yield estimates and the determination of which costs are capitalizable 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
variations in methods or assumptions could have a material impact on our results 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our net income 
a write down of our inventory would decrease current year net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
as of january  we have million of inventory recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 
tangible long lived assets property  plant and equipment and other tangible long lived assets are carried at cost 
this cost is charged to depreciation or amortization expense over the estimated life of the operating assets primarily using straight line rates 
long lived assets are subject to impairment assessment 
we assess the impairment of tangible long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability potential is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the related total future undiscounted cash flows 
the projected cash flows for each asset group considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  proceeds from the sale of the asset group  reasonable contract renewal assumptions from the perspective of a marketplace participant  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
if an asset group s carrying value is not recoverable through related cash flows  the asset group is considered to be impaired 
impairment is measured by comparing the asset group s carrying amount to its fair value 
when it is determined that useful lives of assets are shorter than originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the asset group  we accelerate the rate of depreciation in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives 
estimation of the useful lives of tangible assets that are long lived requires significant management judgment 
events could occur  including changes in cash flow that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter the assumptions regarding the ability to realize the return of our investment in long lived assets 
also  as we make manufacturing process conversions and other facility consolidation decisions  we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of our assets  primarily manufacturing equipment and buildings 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future depreciation expense or could create future impairments of these long lived assets 
a write down in our tangible long lived assets would decrease current year net income by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
as of january  we have million of tangible long lived assets recorded on our balance sheet representing of total assets 
balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of variations of key assumptions used provision for income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred 
the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when the differences reverse 
beginning in  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
 to assess and record income tax uncertainties 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
in relation to recording the provision for income taxes  management must estimate the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of temporary differences  make certain assumptions regarding whether book tax differences are permanent or temporary and if temporary  the related timing of expected reversal 
also  estimates are made as to whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
alternatively  we may make estimates about the potential usage of deferred tax assets that decrease our valuation allowances 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when we believe that certain tax positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit or the lapse of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
we follow fin no 
for accounting for our uncertain tax positions 
changes could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes 
changes in current tax laws and tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  thereby changing the income tax provision 
also  significant declines in taxable income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 
at january   we had million of deferred tax assets on our balance sheet and a valuation allowance of million has been established for certain deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
a increase in the effective tax rate would increase the current year provision by million  reducing diluted earnings per share by based on shares outstanding at january  our financial results the commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes

our acquisitions  which expanded our product lines and diversified our customer base  contributed million incremental revenue in revenue for also included approximately million of additional sales as a result of being a week fiscal year versus which had weeks 
imc the nature and extent of our selling relationship with our customers is different in terms of products purchased  selling prices  product volumes  ordering patterns and inventory management 
we have pricing arrangements with our customers that at times do not specify minimum order quantities 
our visibility to customer ordering patterns is over a relatively short period of time 
our customers may have inventory management programs and alternate supply arrangements of which we are unaware 
additionally  the relative market share among the oem device manufacturers changes periodically 
consequently  these and other factors can significantly impact our sales in any given period 
our revenue from our imc business increased million or over our acquisitions in and contributed million to this increase 
included in our imc segment is our crm neuromodulation product line which saw year over year growth of million  million of which was attributable to our acquisitions in revenue from our imc segment also includes sales from our vascular access and orthopedic product lines which increased million and million  respectively over the prior year and were acquired near the end of and beginning of the additional week of sales added approximately million to our imc revenue in additionally  vascular access revenue benefited from the timing of customer inventory stocking for introducers in the fourth quarter of  which may impact first quarter of revenues 
orthopedic sales during the first three quarters of benefited from the release of excess backlog that was on hand at the time of the precimed acquisitions  which has since been fulfilled 
the non acquisition related increase in crm neuromodulation revenue in was primarily due to higher feedthrough  and assembly revenue partially offset by lower icd battery  coated components and icd capacitor sales 
the increase in feedthrough revenue can be attributed to market growth as well as the timing of customer product launches 
the increase in assembly sales reflected an increase in price during due to contractual agreements related to material price increases 
the decrease in icd battery revenue is primarily due to customer vertical integration partially offset by increased adoption of our q series high rate icd batteries 
the decline in coated component sales is primarily the result of a customer changing product mix near the end of due to marketplace field actions 
revenues in included an increased level of capacitor sales due to a customer supply issue in the first half of electrochem similar to imc customers  we have pricing arrangements with our customers that many times do not specify minimum quantities 
our visibility to customer ordering patterns is over a relatively short period of time as most customers utilize short term purchase orders as opposed to long term contracts 
electrochem sales grew million or in to million 
this included million of incremental revenue from our acquisitions in on an organic basis electrochem revenue increased  which includes approximately million of additional revenue as a result of being a week fiscal year versus which had weeks 
the core growth in electrochem sales primarily came from our energy markets 
oil and gas drilling activity was strong during  but is expected to be more tempered in due to the economic slow down 
additionally  we continue to gain market share across our markets 
sales outlook we expect our full year sales will be in the range of million to million 
this revenue projection assumes that we will continue to grow faster than our underlying market by leveraging our diversified revenue base and our strength in the development and manufacturing of custom technologies for our customers 
these growth projections may be impacted by a variety of factors including a softening in the orthopedic and commercial energy markets  potential delays in elective surgeries  the current financial market unrest  changes in exchange rates and changes in the health care reimbursement policies 
within the imd markets we serve  the orthopedics market represents the least predictable market due to the elective nature of many of the surgeries 
cost of sales changes from the prior year to cost of sales as a percentage of sales were primarily due to the following increase impact of and acquisitions a inventory step up amortization b mix change c volume change d price change e impact of annualized consolidation savings f total percentage point change to cost of sales as a percentage of sales a 
we completed seven acquisitions from the second quarter of to the first quarter of the acquired companies are currently operating with a higher cost of sales percentage than our legacy businesses due to less efficient operations and products contracts that generally carry lower margins 
we are currently in the process of applying our lean manufacturing processes to their operations and implementing plans for plant consolidation in order to lower cost of sales as percentage of sales see cost savings and consolidation efforts 
these initiatives  as well as increased sales volumes  are expected to help improve our cost of sales percentage over the next two years 
b 
in connection with our acquisitions in and  the value of inventory on hand was stepped up to reflect the fair value at the time of acquisition 
this stepped up value is amortized to cost of sales excluding intangible amortization as the inventory to which the adjustment relates is sold 
the inventory step up amortization was million and million for and  respectively 
as of january  there was no remaining inventory step up to be amortized 
c 
the revenue increase in  excluding acquisitions  included a higher mix of low rate medical batteries and assembly sales  which generally have lower margins 
additionally  revenue from coated components  icd capacitors and high rate medical batteries  which are generally higher margin products  were lower 
d 
this decrease is primarily due to higher feedthrough production which absorbed a higher amount of fixed costs such as plant overhead and depreciation 
in addition  higher overhead efficiencies were driven by greater inventory build for moves and replenishment of safety stock 
e 
this decrease was primarily driven by contractual price increases for our high rate medical batteries and price increases contingent upon raw material costs 
f 
this decrease was a result of a reduction in excess capacity in connection with our facility consolidations completed in see cost savings and consolidation efforts 
we expect cost of sales as a percentage of sales to benefit in future years from our consolidation efforts and the elimination of excess capacity 
sg a expenses changes from the prior year to sg a expenses were primarily due to the following in millions increase headcount increases associated with acquisitions a amortization b enpath legal expense c other d net increase in sg a a

these intangible assets are amortized to sg a over their estimated useful lives 
c

these increases were offset by our efforts to streamline these functions in to better align resources as well as the timing of cost reimbursements 
rd e expenses are expected to increase in  reflecting our continued development of and investment in core product technologies 
other operating expenses acquired in process research and development approximately million and million of the purchase price related to the and acquisitions  respectively  was allocated to ipr d projects acquired 
these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date  thus were immediately expensed on the date of acquisition 
additional information regarding these projects is set forth in note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report and product development section of this item

the expenses are primarily for consultants  relocation and travel costs that will not be required after the integrations are completed 
c 
during and  we had various asset disposals which were partially offset by insurance proceeds received on previously disposed assets 
in consolidation and integration expenses are expected to be approximately million to million 
interest expense and interest income interest expense for is million higher than primarily due to the additional million of convertible notes issued at the beginning of as well as the additional interest expense associated with line of credit draws used to fund our acquisitions and debt extinguishment in see note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information about our long term debt obligations 
we expect non cash interest expense to increase materially in as a result of the changes in accounting for convertible debt effective in see impact of recently issued accounting standards section of this item for a further description of these changes 
cash interest costs for should remain relatively consistent with as we have fixed a significant portion of our interest costs utilizing interest rate swaps 
interest income for decreased by million in comparison to the prior year primarily due to the cash deployed in connection with our acquisitions in and we expect interest income to remain comparable to the current year level for the foreseeable future

the net result of the above transactions was a gain of million  million of which was recorded in and million in provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal year of is lower than the us statutory rate primarily as a result of the swiss tax holiday tax benefit  offset in part by the ipr d charge from the acquisition of precimed  which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year of was higher than the us statutory rate primarily as a result of the ipr d charge from the acquisition of enpath  which was not deductible for income tax purposes

this growth came during a period in which the crm industry continued to recover from a difficult our acquisitions which expanded our product lines and diversified our customer base represented a increase in revenue 
imc we achieved year over year growth of in our imc business despite our underlying markets growing at a low single digit pace and an approximate net reduction in selling prices 
our acquisitions represented a increase in imc revenue 
icd capacitors  icd batteries  assembly products and coated electrodes were the primary growth drivers 
icd capacitor sales increased due to a non recurring customer supply issue in the first half of the year 
growth in icd batteries was primarily due to increased sales of our q technology battery which was introduced near the end of  partially offset by lower prices 
this growth represents increased adoption of our high rate battery technology 
consistent with our strategy to increase the integration of our component products including enclosures into our assembly business  assembly revenues  which are included in other imc revenue  increased by in correspondingly  revenues from enclosures decreased by over the same period 
in addition to the above  the increase in assembly sales reflected an increase in price due to contractual agreements related to material price increases 
electrochem electrochem sales grew by in through a combination of increased market penetration  new product introductions  greater value added pack assembly and acquisitions 
our acquisitions represented a increase in electrochem revenue 
the core growth rate slowed from the prior year partially due to the favorable benefit of approximately to million in customer inventory stocking in as they consolidated operations 
cost of sales changes from the prior year to cost of sales as a percentage of sales were primarily due to the following increase price reduction a inventory step up b excess capacity at columbia facility c total percentage point change to cost of sales as a percentage of sales a 
this increase was primarily due to contractual price concessions negotiated with our larger customers 
price reductions were negotiated in exchange for longer term commitments  primarily in the imc segment

during  we recorded a loss of million related to the write off of a battery test system that was under development 
upon completion of our engineering and technical evaluation  it was determined that the system could not meet the required specifications in a cost effective manner 
this charge was included in the imc business segment 
the remaining expense for includes charges for various asset dispositions and million for professional fees related to a potential acquisition that was no longer considered probable 
interest expense and interest income interest expense for is higher than the prior year period primarily due to the additional million of convertible notes issued at the end of the first quarter of and additional amortization of deferred fees and discounts associated with these notes and the notes exchanged at that time 
see note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information about our long term debt obligations

the net result of the above transaction was a gain of million which was recorded in as other income expense  net 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate is higher than the us statutory rate primarily as a result of the ipr d charge from the acquisition of enpath  which is non deductible for income tax purposes 
as a result  our effective tax rate was in excluding this ipr d charge  our effective tax rate was consistent with liquidity and capital resources as of january  december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents and short term investments a b working capital b current ratio b a 
we did not hold any short term investments as of january  short term investments in consisted of municipal  us government agency and corporate notes and bonds acquired with maturities that exceed three months 
b 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased primarily due to the cash used to acquire precimed and the chaumont facility and capital expenditures which were funded by million of net cash received from borrowings and million of cash flow generated from operations 
our increase in working capital was primarily due to the growth of the company 
as a percentage of assets  working capital remained consistent with the prior year at approximately 
our current ratio remained relatively consistent with year end amounts 
we expect cash generated from operations to be sufficient to fund our consolidation and integration initiatives  future capital expenditures  contractual obligations and debt service payments 
revolving line of credit we have a senior credit facility the credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit  which can be increased to million upon our request 
the credit facility also contains a million letter of credit subfacility and a million swingline subfacility 
the credit facility is secured by our non realty assets including cash  accounts and notes receivable  and inventories  and has an expiration date of may  with a one time option to extend to april  if no default has occurred 
interest rates under the credit facility are  at our option  based upon the current prime rate or the libor rate plus a margin that varies with our leverage ratio 
if interest is paid based upon the prime rate  the applicable margin is between minus and 
if interest is paid based upon the libor rate  the applicable margin is between and 
we are required to pay a commitment fee between and per annum on the unused portion of the credit facility based on our leverage ratio 
the credit facility contains limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness  limitations on the incurrence of liens and licensing of intellectual property  limitations on investments and restrictions on certain payments 
except to the extent paid for by common equity of greatbatch or paid for out of cash on hand  the credit facility limits the amount paid for acquisitions in total to million 
the restrictions on payments  among other things  limit repurchases of our stock to million and our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of our convertible subordinated notes  and dividends 
these limitations can be waived upon approval of a simple majority of the lenders 
such waiver was obtained in order to fund the precimed acquisition and repurchase our convertible subordinated notes in the credit facility also requires us to maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  to interest expense of at least to  and a total leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  of not greater than to from may  through september  and not greater than to from september  and thereafter 
as of january   we are in compliance with the required covenants 
the credit facility contains customary events of default 
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default  a majority of the lenders may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the credit facility immediately due and payable 
in connection with our acquisition of precimed and the chaumont facility  we borrowed million under this revolving line of credit in we borrowed an additional net million under the revolving line of credit since that time in order to fund the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings as of january   which does not include the impact of our interest rate swaps  was 
interest rates reset based upon the six month million  three month million  two month million and one month million libor rate 
based upon current capital needs  we do not anticipate making significant principal payments on the revolving line of credit within the next twelve months 
as of january   we had million available under our revolving line of credit 
extinguishment of debt in december we entered into privately negotiated agreements under which we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due at per  of principal 
the primary purpose of this transaction was to retire the debentures  which contained a put option exercisable on june   at a discount 
this transaction was funded with availability under our existing line of credit 
this transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
as of january  we have outstanding million of convertible subordinated notes due  which contain a put option exercisable on june  we believe that our cash flow from operations  as well as availability under our existing line of credit will be sufficient to fund the repayment of these notes if put to us 
the remaining million of convertible subordinated notes are not due until and do not have a put option 
operating activities net cash flows from operating activities for increased million over this increase was primarily driven by higher net income excluding non cash items consisting of depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  non cash gains losses of million 
this increase was partially offset by cash flow used by our operating accounts  primarily inventory  due to the timing of inventory purchases and inventory safety stock build up 
the extinguishment of debt in resulted in a reclassification of approximately million of current income tax liability  which will be paid in this amount was previously recorded as a non current deferred tax liability on the balance sheet 
the remaining variances can be attributed to the timing of cash receipts and payments  including those related to the companies acquired in and we anticipate that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  capital expenditure and debt service needs  other than for acquisitions 
included in accounts receivable as of january  is an million value added tax receivable with the french government related to inventory purchases for the chaumont facility 
we have made claims with the proper french authorities and fully expect to collect this amount in the first half of  however collection is not guaranteed 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for this was primarily the result of the acquisition of precimed and the chaumont facility in the increase in property  plant and equipment purchases over of million primarily relates to the construction of our new electrochem manufacturing facility in raynham  ma and the expansion of our corporate offices in our current expectation for is that capital spending will be in the range of million to million of which approximately half are discretionary in nature 
these purchases relate to routine investments to support our internal growth and to maintain our technology leadership 
we anticipate cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures 
we regularly engage in discussions relating to potential acquisitions 
we continually assess our financing facilities and capital structure to ensure liquidity and capital levels are sufficient to meet our strategic objectives 
going forward  we will continue to pursue strategically targeted and opportunistic acquisitions 
financing activities cash flow provided by financing activities for primarily related to million of borrowings on our revolving line of credit taken in connection with the acquisition of precimed and the chaumont facility and an additional net million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit in order to fund our repurchase of million par value of our convertible subordinated notes 
we repaid million of the debt assumed from precimed during in  we repaid million of debt assumed from enpath 
during  we received net proceeds of million in connection with our issuance of convertible subordinated notes and paid million of financing fees related to that transaction and the new revolving credit agreement discussed above 
capital structure at january   our capital structure consisted of million of convertible subordinated notes  million of debt under our revolving line of credit and million shares of common stock outstanding 
additionally  we have million in cash and cash equivalents which is sufficient to meet our short term operating cash needs 
if necessary  we have access to million under our available line of credit and are authorized to issue million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
the market value of our outstanding common stock since our initial public offering has exceeded our book value  accordingly  we believe that if needed we can access public markets to raise additional capital 
our capital structure allows us to support our internal growth and provides liquidity for corporate development initiatives 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
litigation we are a party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
while we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending activities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in the period in which the ruling occurs

for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are normally based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we enter into blanket orders with vendors that have preferred pricing and terms  however these orders are normally cancelable by us without penalty 
d

these amounts do not include any potential future contributions to our pension plan that may be necessary if the rate of return earned on pension plan assets is not sufficient to fund the rate of increase of our pension liability 
future cash contributions may be required 
as of january  our actuarially determined pension liability exceeded the plans assets by million 
this table does not include the forward contract entered into in february to purchase million mexican pesos per month from march to december at an exchange rate of pesos per one us dollar 
this contract was entered into in order to hedge the risk of peso denominated payments associated with the operations at our tijuana  mexico facility 
this contract will be accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
inflation we utilize certain critical raw materials including precious metals in our products that we obtain from a limited number of suppliers due to the technically challenging requirements of the supplied product and or the lengthy process required to qualify these materials with our customers 
we cannot quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these materials because of these requirements 
our results may be negatively impacted by an increase in the price of these critical raw materials 
this risk is partially mitigated as many of the supply agreements with our customers allow us to partially adjust prices for the impact of any raw material price increases and the supply agreements with our vendors have final one time buy clauses to meet a long term need 
historically  raw material price increases have not materially impacted our results of operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
this issue prescribes a two step process for determining whether an instrument or an embedded feature  such as our convertible subordinated notes  is indexed to our stock as follows step if the instrument is not based on a an observable market  other than the market for our stock  or b an observable index  other than an index calculated or measured solely by reference to our own operations then the instrument is considered indexed to our own stock 
step if the instrument settlement amount is fixed then the instrument is considered indexed to our own stock 
if we determine that our convertible subordinated notes are not indexed to our own stock  they would not meet the scope exception in paragraph a of sfas no 
and thus would be accounted for under sfas no 
we are still evaluating the impact of eitf on our consolidated financial statements  which is effective beginning in fiscal year in june  the fasb issued staff position fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this fsp concluded that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards restricted stock that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends are considered participating securities 
accordingly  the two class method of computing basic and diluted eps is required for these securities 
fsp  which was effective beginning in fiscal year  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in future financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this fsp requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement separately account for the liability and equity components of those instruments in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
this statement is effective beginning in fiscal year and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in future financial statements 
this fsp is only applicable prospectively if we determine that our convertible subordinated notes are indexed to our own stock under the guidance of eitf we estimate that this fsp  if applicable  will increase non cash interest expense by approximately million to million and reduce diluted eps by approximately per share to per share

sfas no 
r is effective for acquisitions consummated beginning in fiscal year and will materially impact our consolidated financial statements if we consummate an acquisition after the date of adoption 
sfas no 
r provides that any changes to an entity s acquired uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances associated with acquired deferred tax assets will no longer be applied to goodwill  regardless of the acquisition date of the associated business combination 
as such  any changes to the acquired uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances will be recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense

in february  the fasb issued fsp fas b effective date of fasb statement no 
this fsp partially deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas no 
effective in fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency with our acquisition of precimed and the chaumont facility  we significantly increased our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in swiss francs and euros 
we continually evaluate our exposure to foreign currency risk and develop hedging strategy s to best mitigate these risks  which include the use of various derivative instruments 
we believe that a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would not have a material impact on our net earnings as the impact of foreign currency rates on revenue is almost entirely offset by the inverse impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses 
in december  we entered into a forward contract to purchase  chf  at an exchange rate of chf per one us dollar  in order to partially fund the acquisition of precimed  which closed in january and was payable in swiss francs 
in january  we entered into an additional forward contract to purchase  chf at an exchange rate of per one us dollar

the net result of the above transactions was a gain of million  million of which was recorded in as other income expense  net 
in february  we entered into a forward contract to purchase million mexican pesos per month from march to december at an exchange rate of pesos per one us dollar 
this contract was entered into in order to hedge the risk of peso denominated payments associated with the operations at our tijuana  mexico facility 
this contract will be accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
we translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations of precimed and the chaumont facility acquired in at the period end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period 
the net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the consolidated financial statements as comprehensive income loss 
the aggregate translation adjustment for was a loss of million 
translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries 
net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income amounted to a gain of million for a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency subsidiary p medical holding sa swiss francs would have had an impact of approximately million on these foreign net assets as of january  included in accounts receivable as of january  is an million value added tax receivable with the french government related to inventory purchases for the chaumont facility 
we have made claims with the proper french authorities and fully expect to collect this amount in the first half of  however collection is not guaranteed 
this receivable is denominated in euros and is subject to foreign currency risk  which could be material 
interest rate swaps as of january   we had million outstanding on our revolving line of credit
