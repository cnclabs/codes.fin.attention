item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general lufkin industries is a global supplier of oil field and power transmission products 
through its oil field segment  the company manufactures and services artificial reciprocating rod lift equipment and related products  which are used to extract crude oil and other fluids from wells 
through its power transmission segment  the company manufactures and services high speed and low speed increasing and reducing gearboxes for industrial applications 
while these markets are price competitive  technological and quality differences can provide product differentiation 
the company s strategy is to differentiate its products through additional value added capabilities 
examples of these capabilities are high quality engineering  customized designs  rapid manufacturing response to demand through plant capacity  inventory and vertical integration  superior quality and customer service  and an international network of service locations 
in addition  the company s strategy is to maintain a low debt to equity ratio in order to quickly take advantage of growth opportunities and pay dividends even during unfavorable business cycles 
in support of the above strategy  the company has been making capital investments in oil field to increase manufacturing capacity and capabilities in its three main manufacturing facilities in lufkin  texas  canada and argentina 
these investments should reduce production lead times  improve quality and reduce manufacturing costs 
investments also continue to be made to expand the company s presence in automation products and international service 
in power transmission  the company continues to expand its gear repair network by opening and expanding facilities in various locations in the us and canada 
the company is making targeted capital investments in the us and france to expand capacity and reduce manufacturing lead times as well as certain capital investments targeting cost reductions 
trends outlook oil field demand for pumping unit equipment primarily depends on the level of new onshore oil well and workover drilling activity as well as the depth and fluid conditions of that drilling 
drilling activity is driven by the available cash flow of the company s customers as well as their long term perceptions of the level and stability of the price of oil 
the higher energy prices experienced since have increased the demand for pumping units and related service and products from higher drilling activity  activation of idle wells and the upgrading of existing wells 
during  demand in the north american market was negatively affected by the impact of lower natural gas prices on coal bed methane and other unconventional gas production that use rod pumps to de water wells  drilling program delays from m a activity  cost control efforts deferring or reducing capital spending programs and the competitive pressure from lower priced pumping units in areas traditionally served by the used unit market 
traditionally  as pumping unit demand increases and availability of used equipment diminishes  demand for new equipment increases 
in  lower priced imported pumping units entered the north american market in place of used equipment and reduced the incremental demand for the company s new pumping units 
during the first nine months of  demand levels in north america increased over the levels experienced in the latter half of as higher energy prices drove increased drilling and workover activity 
additionally  the demand for pumping units  oilfield services and automation equipment continued to increase in international markets 
in the fourth quarter of  energy prices dramatically declined due to reductions in global demand 
planned new drilling and workover activity has also reduced significantly as capital budgets have been cut 
e p companies have reduced drilling in higher cost fields that are not economically viable at lower energy prices and have lowered overall capital budgets in order to remain cash flow positive and avoid the more expensive credit markets 
these declines have been more pronounced in the us  but are expected to be reflected in international markets in future periods 
new pumping unit booking levels declined in the fourth quarter of from lower demand  order cancellations for units scheduled to ship in and price reductions for units scheduled to ship in these price reductions have primarily been in response to the decline in raw material costs in the fourth quarter of for steel and iron castings 
gross margin levels may be negatively impacted from these reductions and from reduced plant utilizations 
while the market is suffering a cyclical decline  the company continues to believe that there are long term positive growth trends for artificial lift equipment  and as existing fields mature  the market will require an increased use of pumping units for artificial lift  especially in the south american  russian and middle eastern markets 
power transmission power transmission services many diverse markets  with high speed gearing for markets such as petrochemicals  refineries  offshore production and transmission of oil and slow speed gearing for the gas  rubber  sugar  paper  steel  plastics  mining  cement and marine propulsion  each of which has its own unique set of drivers 
generally  if general global industrial capacity utilizations are not high  spending on new equipment lags 
also impacting demand are government regulations involving safety and environmental issues that can require capital spending 
recent market demand increases have come from energy related markets such as refining  petrochemical  drilling  coal  marine and power generation in response to higher global energy prices 
while recent declines in energy prices have not impacted demand  sustained lower energy prices could reduce demand for power transmission products and services in future periods 
because power transmission products are generally components in large scale projects that tend to have longer lead times  bookings are not as volatile 
due to lower energy prices and access to capital markets  customers may reduce future large scale energy related projects 
however  governments are increasing funding for infrastructure and alternative energy projects for economic stimulus purposes  which may create opportunities for power transmission products 
discontinued operations during the second quarter of  the trailer segment was classified as a discontinued operation 
in january  the company announced the decision to suspend its participation in the commercial trailer markets and to develop a plan to run out existing inventories  fulfill contractual obligations and close all trailer facilities in during the second quarter of  this plan was completed  with the majority of the remaining inventory and manufacturing equipment sold and all facilities closed 
trailer generated income of million  million and million  net of tax  during  and  respectively 
other during the fourth quarter of  the company booked a contingent liability provision of million pre tax for its ongoing class action lawsuit

summary of results the company generally monitors its performance through analysis of sales  gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales and net earnings  as well as debt equity levels  short term debt levels  and cash balances 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the impact of discontinued operations 
overall  sales for increased to million from million for  or  and million for this increase was primarily driven by increased sales of oil field products and services in the us market but also from continued growth in power transmission sales 
gross margin for decreased to from for  primarily due to non cash additions to lifo inventory reserves related to the inflationary impact of higher raw material prices for steel and castings 
however  gross margin levels increased over the level of due to the favorable mix towards new pumping unit sales 
additional segment data on gross margin is provided later in this section 
higher selling  general and administrative expenses also negatively impacted net earnings  with these expenses increasing to million during from million during and million during this increase was primarily related to higher divisional spending to support higher sales volume  higher third party commissions and increases in bad debt provisions

commercial casting sales of million during were down million  or  compared to million during  from lower sales to the machine tool market 
oil field s backlog also increased to million as of december   from million at december  this increase was driven by increased bookings for new units for the us and latin american markets as higher energy prices drove increased drilling and workover activity 
also  certain us customers placed orders for new units to be shipped through the first half of versus their normal buying practice of ordering units as needed 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales for the oil field segment increased to  or percentage points  for year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this gross margin increase was related to price increases instituted to offset material price increases and the favorable mix effect of increased new unit sales  partially offset by increased non cash additions to lifo inventory reserves of million  or percentage points of gross margin  related to the inflationary impact of higher raw material prices for steel and castings 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for oil field increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to higher employee related expenses in support of increased sales volumes  third party commissions and bad debt provisions

interest income  interest expense and other income and expense for the year ended december   decreased to million of income compared to income of million for the year ended december   primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances and the unfavorable currency impact of the weakening canadian dollar during compared to pension income  which is reported as a reduction of cost of sales  decreased to million for the year ended december   or  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower expected returns on asset balances 
in  pension expense of approximately million is expected due to the significant declines in the market value of the qualified pension plan assets during the net tax rate for the year ended december   was compared to for the year ended december  the net tax rate in benefitted from a reduction in tax reserves on items falling out of statute 
also  the net tax rate was unfavorably impacted by higher state taxes due to the mix of sales shifting towards higher tax jurisdictions

oil field oil field sales decreased slightly to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  increased sales of oil field services  automation equipment and new pumping units in the middle east and argentina markets was offset by lower sales of new pumping units in the north american market 
oil field s backlog increased to million as of december   from million at december  this increase is related to increased orders for the argentina and middle east markets  partially offset by weaker demand for new pumping units in the north american market 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales for the oil field segment increased slightly to  or percentage points  for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  direct selling  general and administrative expenses for oil field increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to higher employee related expenses in support of increased sales levels 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales also increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  power transmission sales for the company s power transmission segment increased to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this growth was the result of increased sales of high speed units to the energy related markets  such as power generation and oil and gas drilling  production and refining from both the us and france manufacturing facilities and low speed marine units for the coastal  river and inland waterway transportation market 
power transmission backlog at december   increased to million from million at december   primarily from sales of new units for the marine and oil drilling markets 
gross margin for the power transmission segment increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   from increased plant efficiencies and fixed cost coverage from higher production volumes and the benefit of greater sales of high speed units 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses for power transmission increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to higher employee related expenses in support of increased sales volumes 
direct selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  however  decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  corporate other corporate administrative expenses  which are allocated to the segments primarily based on historical third party revenues  increased to million  or  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily from the higher employee related expenses and stock option expenses 
net interest income  interest expense and other income and expense for the year ended december   totaled million of income compared to income of million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher cash balances and the favorable impact of the stronger canadian currency on us dollar denominated liabilities 
pension income  which is reported as a reduction of cost of sales  increased to million  or  for the year ended december   or  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily from expected asset returns exceeding expected expense increases 
the net tax rate for the year ended december   was compared to for the year ended december  the lower net tax rate in was the result of several items 
a tax initiative to claim research and experimentation tax credits for the through tax years and the recent legislation passed to allow a research and experimentation tax credit for the tax year produced a significant benefit to the tax rate 
a lower effective state tax rate  and the related benefit to deferred tax balances  combined with the favorable impact on state deferred tax balances due to the new texas margin tax also produced a benefit to the net tax rate 
other items such as lower international tax rates and revisions to prior period estimates produced additional benefits to the net tax rate 
due to the discontinuation of the trailer segment  certain items previously allocated to that segment have been reclassified to continuing operations 
one adjustment is related to pension and postretirement charges associated with trailer personnel that will continue to be a liability in future years 
the other adjustment is for corporate allocations previously charged to trailer as these expenses will continue in the future 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically relied on cash flows from operations and third party borrowing to finance its operations  including acquisitions  dividend payments and stock repurchases 
the company believes that its cash flows from operations and its available borrowing capacity under its credit agreements will be sufficient to fund its operations  including planned capital expenditures  dividend payments and stock repurchases  through december   and the foreseeable future 
the company s cash balance totaled million at december   compared to million at december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  net cash used in investing activities by continuing operations totaled million and net cash used by financing activities amounted to million 
significant components of cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations included net earnings  adjusted for non cash expenses  of million  offset by an increase in working capital of million 
this working capital increase was primarily due to increased fifo inventory balances of million from higher production activity in oil field and power transmission and strategic steel purchases  higher receivables balances of million due to sales volume increases  partially offset by increased accounts payable of million 
net cash used in investing activities was primarily from net capital expenditures totaling million for the expansion of manufacturing and service capacity and efficiency improvements in the oil field and power transmission segments 
capital expenditures for are projected to be approximately million  primarily for the expansion of manufacturing and service capacity and equipment replacement for efficiency improvements in the oil field and power transmission segments and will be funded by operating cash flows 
additional strategic capital expenditures of million may be authorized depending on market outlooks and available operating cash flows 
significant components of net cash used by financing activities included dividend payments of million  or per share and treasury stock purchases of million  offset by the impact of stock option exercises  including the excess tax benefit from actual gains on stock option exercises  of million 
the company has a three year credit facility with a domestic bank the bank facility consisting of an unsecured revolving line of credit that provides up to million of aggregate borrowing 
this bank facility expires on december  borrowings under the bank facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either the greater of i the prime rate  ii the base cd rate plus an applicable margin or iii the federal funds effective rate plus an applicable margin or the london interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin  depending on certain ratios as defined in the bank facility 
as of december   no debt was outstanding under the bank facility and the company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the terms of the bank facility 
deducting outstanding letters of credit of million  million of borrowing capacity was available at december  during  the company repurchased shares pursuant to a plan approved by the board of directors in the third quarter of  under which the company was authorized to spend up to an aggregate of million for repurchases of its common stock 
repurchased shares are added to treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes including the funding of the company s stock option plans 
during   shares were repurchased under the above plans at an aggregate price of million  or an average price of per share 
as of december    shares had been repurchased under the plan at an aggregate price of million  or per share 
during the fourth quarter of   shares were repurchased under the plan at an aggregate price of million  or per share 
as of december   the company held  shares of treasury stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
at december   no repurchase authorizations remained under the plan 
the following table summarizes the company s expected cash outflows from financial contracts and commitments as of december  information on recurring purchases of materials for use in manufacturing and service operations has not been included 
these amounts are not long term in nature less than three months and are generally consistent from year to year 
in thousands of dollars payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations contractual commitments for capital expenditures total since the company has no significant tax loss carryforwards  the company expects to make quarterly estimated tax payments in based on taxable income levels 
also  the company has various qualified retirement plans for which the company has committed a certain level of benefit 
the company expects to make contributions to its pension plans of million to million and to its post retirement health and life plans of approximately million in  depending on participation levels in these plans 
contribution levels to these plans after will depend on participation in the plans  possible plan changes  discount rates and actual rates of return on plan assets 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  included in the lufkin consolidated balance sheet at december  is approximately million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the jurisdictions in which lufkin conducts business 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  lufkin cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
prior to sfas  there were different definitions of fair value and limited and dispersed guidance for applying those definitions 
sfas retains the exchange price notion of fair value and clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources and the reporting entity s own assumptions 
sfas also clarifies that market participant assumptions should include assumptions about risk and the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset 
sfas expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods and the inputs used to measure fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the provisions of sfas should be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied except for certain types of financial instruments 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas and no 
fas  which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and removes certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas in october  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  which clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
fas was effective upon issuance 
on january   the company adopted the initial requirements of sfas and it had no significant impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on september   the company adopted the requirements of sfas and it had no significant impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on january   the company adopted the remaining requirements of sfas and it had no significant impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised business combinations sfas r  replacing statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas 
sfas r broadens the scope of sfas by applying the acquisition method of accounting to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more businesses and not just business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration 
sfas r also modifies the application of the acquisition method 
sfas r requires acquired assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value at the acquisition date versus the cost allocation process used under sfas this change will require acquisition related costs and restructuring costs that are expected but not legally obligated to be recognized separately from the acquisition 
sfas r also provides revised guidance on accounting for step acquisitions  assets and liabilities arising from contingencies  measuring goodwill and gains from bargain purchases and contingent consideration at the acquisition date 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  on january   the company adopted sfas r  which will be applied prospectively 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued financial statement position no 
fas r employer s disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets fsp r  which amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised employer s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits sfas r 
fsp r expands the disclosure requirements about postretirement plan assets to include how investment allocations are made  including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies  the major categories of plan assets  the input and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level on changes in plan assets for the periods and significant concentration of risk with plan assets 
the disclosures about plan assets required by fsp r shall be provided for fiscal years ending after december  upon initial application  the provisions of fsp r are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes 
management believes the impact of other recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated statements 
the company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been established to provide for estimated losses on receivable collections 
the balance of this allowance is determined by regular reviews of outstanding receivables and historical experience 
as the financial condition of customers change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
revenue is not recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned 
the criteria to meet this guideline are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in some cases  a customer is not able to take delivery of a completed product and requests that the company store the product for a defined period of time 
the company will process a bill and hold invoice and recognize revenue at the time of the storage request if all of the following criteria are met l the customer has accepted title and risk of loss  l the customer has provided a written purchase order for the product  l the customer  not the company  requested the product to be stored and to be invoiced under a bill and hold arrangement 
the customer must also provide the business purpose for the storage request  l the customer must provide a storage period and future shipping date  l the company must not have retained any future performance obligations on the product  l the company must segregate the stored product and not make it available to use on other orders  and l the product must be completed and ready for shipment 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers 
on a routine basis  the company uses estimates in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by market activity levels  production requirements  the physical condition of products and technological innovation 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
also  the company accounts for a significant portion of its inventory under the lifo method 
the lifo reserve can be impacted by changes in the lifo layers and by inflation index adjustments 
generally  annual increases in the inflation rate or the fifo value of inventory cause the value of the lifo reserve to increase 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value can be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows  based on expected future operating results 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value and thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill acquired in connection with business combinations represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the company performs impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than fair value  such as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company s fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flows  which requires management to make judgments about future operating results  working capital requirements and capital spending levels 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors which negatively impact the fair value of the operations would influence the evaluation and may result in a determination that goodwill is impaired and a corresponding impairment charge 
the company adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
the company is required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more likely than not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax laws  in order to recognize an income tax benefit 
this requires the company to make many assumptions and judgments regarding merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law 
additionally  if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more likely than not the company is required to make judgments and assumptions to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a consequence  changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in the financial position of the company could also affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
if management estimates that some or all of any deferred tax assets will expire before realization or that the future deductibility is more likely than not  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
the company is subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its businesses and operations 
the company retains a portion of the insured losses that occur through the use of deductibles 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported insured and non insured claims and legal actions and provides for losses through reserves 
as circumstances develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
the company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost to the customer or the issuance of credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  but ranges from one year to five years 
the company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical warranty claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or other information becomes available 
the company offers defined benefit plans and other benefits upon the retirement of its employees 
assets and liabilities associated with these benefits are calculated by third party actuaries under the rules provided by various accounting standards  with certain estimates provided by management 
these estimates include the discount rate  expected rate of return of assets and the rate of increase of compensation and health claims 
on a regular basis  management reviews these estimates by comparing them to actual experience and those used by other companies 
if a change in an estimate is made  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities may have to be adjusted 
differences in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within reasonably likely ranges would have had the following estimated impact on results pension other thousands of dollars benefits benefits discount rate effect of change on net periodic benefit cost income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  invested funds and debt obligations 
the book value of accounts receivable  short term debt and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their fair market value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
the company s accounts receivable are not concentrated in one customer or industry and are not viewed as an unusual credit risk 
the company does not utilize financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes or to hedge exposures to interest rates  foreign currency rates or commodity prices 
due to the lack of current debt  the company does not have any significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
however  if the company drew on its line of credit under its bank facility  the company would have exposure since the interest rate is variable 
in addition  the company primarily invoices and purchases in the same currency as the functional currency of its operations  which minimizes exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
the company uses large amounts of steel  iron and electricity in the manufacture of its products 
the price of these raw materials has a significant impact on the cost of producing products 
steel and electricity prices have increased significantly in the last five years  caused primarily by higher energy prices and increased global demand 
since most of the company s suppliers are not currently parties to long term contracts with us  the company is vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials 
factors such as supply and demand  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and dealers  the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price of cast iron and steel 
raw material prices may increase significantly in the future 
certain items such as steel round  bearings and aluminum have continued to experience price increases  price volatility and longer lead times 
if the company is unable to pass future raw material price increases on to its customers  margins  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company is exposed to currency fluctuations with intercompany debt denominated in us dollars owed to the company s us entity by its french and canadian subsidiaries

as of december   if the us dollar strengthened by over these currencies  the net income impact would be million of expense and if the us dollar weakened by over these currencies  the net income impact would be million of income 
also  certain assets and liabilities  primarily employee and tax related in argentina  denominated in the local currency of foreign operations whose functional currency is the us dollar are exposed to fluctuations in currency rates 
as of december   if the us dollar strengthened or weakened by over these currencies  the net income impact would negligible
