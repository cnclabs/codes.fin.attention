table of contents part i item business overview we are a leading global dedicated security technology company that secures systems and networks from known and unknown threats 
we empower home users  businesses  government agencies  service providers and our partners with the ability to block attacks  prevent disruptions  enforce policy and continuously track and improve their security and compliance 
security has emerged as one of the most critical concerns facing businesses and consumers 
security breaches have risen dramatically in the past few years  fueled in part by the proliferation of mobile devices such as laptop computers  cell phones and smart phones with email and web surfing capabilities 
for corporations  the increasing frequency of security breaches has coincided with expanding regulatory compliance requirements relating to security and more specifically  to privacy 
failure to comply with these requirements  and with the requirements of internal security policies and procedures  creates an additional level of enterprise risk 
for consumers  the increasing frequency of online fraud and security concerns discourages customers from transacting online for example  visiting and purchasing from e commerce sites  using online banking services and preparing taxes online 
all of these trends point toward a growing demand for effective security solutions 
business developments and highlights during we took the following actions  among others  to enhance our business we completed three acquisitions scanalert  inc  reconnex  inc

research and development  investments and acquisitions the market for computer software has low barriers to entry  is subject to rapid technological change and is highly competitive with respect to timely product introductions 
we believe that our ability to maintain our competitiveness depends in large part upon our ability to develop  acquire  integrate  and launch new products and solutions  and to enhance existing offerings 
our research and development efforts support all of our offerings 
they refine our security risk management processes  improve our product design and usability  and keep us at the forefront of threat research 
most importantly  our research helps us better protect our customers 

table of contents in addition to developing new offerings and solutions  our development staff also focuses on upgrades and updates to existing products and on enhancement and integration of acquired technology 
future upgrades and updates may include additional functionality to respond to market needs  while also assuring compatibility with new systems and technologies 
we are committed to researching malicious code and vulnerability through our mcafee avert labs organization

technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue devoting substantial resources to research and development 
as part of our growth strategy  we have also made and expect to continue to make acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses  products and technologies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about our recent business combination activities 
sales and marketing we market our brand  business solutions and offerings directly to commercial and government customers through traditional demand generation programs and events as well as indirectly through resellers and distributors 
our two largest distributors  ingram micro inc and tech data corp  together accounted for of our net revenue in see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about the percentage of net revenue from sales to each of these distributors 
we market our consumer solutions and offerings to individual consumers directly through online distribution methods and indirectly through traditional distribution channels  such as retail and original equipment manufacturers oems 
our consumer business is responsible for online distribution of our products sold to individual consumers over the internet  including products distributed by our online partners  and for licensing of technology to strategic distribution partners for sale to individual consumers  with certain exceptions 
sales in north america our north american sales force is organized by product offerings and customer type 
a subset of our sales representatives focus on renewing the mcafee systems security installed base  while a larger group focuses on our full offering of security risk management products and upgrades 
our customers are served primarily through our reseller partners with a channel marketing organization assisting with lead generation  and a channel support team responsible for partner training and support 
although members of our sales team are a necessary part of the sales process  the majority of our ordering and fulfillment for our commercial customers is handled by our distribution partners 
sales outside of north america outside of north america  we have sales and support operations in emea  japan  asia pacific  and latin america 
in   and  net revenue outside of north america accounted for  and of our net revenue  respectively 
within our global geographies  our sales resources are organized by country  and the larger markets may further allocate their sales resources by product line and or customer types 
as in north america  the majority of our ordering and fulfillment is handled by our distribution partners 
resellers and distributors substantially  all of our sales come through our network of resellers  distributors and retailers 
the mcafee securityalliance global partner program is a global sales and marketing enablement program designed to meet the needs of our reseller partners in supporting end user customers 
we currently utilize corporate resellers  including cdw corporation  computacenter plc  dell  inc  dimension data  insight enterprises  inc  softmart  inc  
table of contents software house international  softchoice corporation and others  as well as network and systems integrators who offer our solutions to corporate  small and medium business and government customers 
independent software distributors who currently supply our products include ingram micro inc  tech data corporation  avnet  inc 
and alternative technology  inc these distributors supply our products primarily to large retailers  value added resellers vars  mail order and telemarketing companies 
we also sell our retail packaged products through several of the larger computer and software retailers as well as broader based retailers  including fry s  office depot  wal mart  costco and yamada 
mcafee sales and marketing teams work closely with our major reseller and distributor accounts to manage demand generating activities  training  order flow and affiliate relationships 
our top ten distributors represented to of net sales during  and our agreements with our distributors are not exclusive and may be terminated by either party without cause 
terminated distributors may not continue to sell our products 
if one of our significant distributors terminated its relationship with us  we could experience a significant disruption in the distribution of our products and a decline in our net revenue 
we use a sell through revenue recognition model for distributors  under which we recognize revenue at the time our distributors sell the products to their customers 
under this model  our distributors are permitted to purchase software licenses from us at the same time they fill customer orders and to pay for hardware and retail products only when they sell these products to their customers 
in addition  prior to selling our products to their customers  our distributors are permitted rights of return subject to varying limitations 
after a distributor sells a product to its customer  the distributor generally has no right to return the product to us  unless we approve the return from the final customer to the distributor 
strategic channel partners our channel efforts include strategic alliances with complementary manufacturers to expand our reach and scale 
oems and internet service providers isps license our products for resale to end users or inclusion with their products 
strategic channel partners include acer  inc  aol  at t  cable and wireless plc  comcast corporation  dell  inc  hewlett packard company  lenovo group limited  sony corporation  telecom italia spa  toshiba  and telefonica spa  among others 
depending on the arrangement  oems may sell our software bundled with the pc or related services  pre install our software and allow us to complete the sale  or sublicense a single version of our products to end users who must register the product with us in order to receive updates 
strategic alliances from time to time  we enter into strategic alliances with third parties to support our future growth plans 
these relationships may include joint technology development and integration  research cooperation  co marketing activities and or sell through arrangements 
for example  our security innovation alliance program is a technology partnering program that is designed to accelerate the development of interoperable security products that can be integrated in complex customer environments 
members of the alliance can develop products that will integrate with epolicy orchestrator and market them as mcafee compatible 
our customers benefit from faster and less costly deployment 
as part of our ntt docomo alliance in japan  we have jointly developed technology to provide integrated malware protection against threats to mobile handsets 
marketing activities our marketing approach involves a collaborative planning process to develop global marketing campaigns aligned to corporate goals and objectives 
global marketing campaigns drive cross sell  up sell and net new customer acquisition activity in support of our business model across our three major product lines  five regional theaters and three customer types 
one of the principal means of marketing our brand  products and services is online via the internet 
our web site  www 
mcafee 
com  supports marketing activities to our key customers and prospects  including home and home office users  small and medium sized businesses  large enterprises and our partner community 
our web site contains various marketing materials and information about our products 
our customers can download and purchase some products directly online 
we also promote the mcafee brand  our products and services through marketing activities in trade publications  direct mail campaigns  television  
table of contents billboards  and strategic arrangements  as well as  online through key word and search based advertising 
we attend trade shows and industry conferences  publish periodic channel and customer newsletters  and generate sales leads through email marketing campaigns 
we also market our products through the use of rebate programs and marketing development funds 
within most countries  we typically offer incentive rebates to channel partners based on sales and promotional rebates to end users 
we use channel marketing to market  promote  train and provide incentives to our resellers and distributors  and to promote our offerings to their end user customers 
we offer our resellers and distributors technical and sales training classes  online training resources  and sales and marketing demand generation assistance kits 
we also provide specific cooperative marketing programs for end user seminars  catalogs  demand creation programs  sales events  and other items 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid changes in technology 
we expect both product and pricing competitive pressures to increase in the near term as the industry continues to consolidate and our competitors grow more rapidly through acquisitions 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  stronger relationships with strategic channel partners  larger technical staffs  established relationships with hardware vendors and or greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and other advantages compared to us 
increasingly  security protection is offered by third parties at significant discounts to our prices or  in some cases is bundled for free 
potential customers may perceive our products as unnecessary if similar functionality is available for free 
if our competitors gain market share in the markets for our products  our sales could grow more slowly or decline 
competitive pressures could also lead to increases in competition driven expenses such as advertising expenses  product rebates and marketing funds provided to our channel partners 
see risk factors we face intense competition and we expect competitive pressures to increase in the future 
this competition could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our corporate products include  but are not limited to  the following performance  functionality and features  brand name recognition  breadth of product group  integration of products  time to market  price  the effectiveness of distributor promotion programs  sales and marketing efforts  quality of customer support and financial stability 
we believe that we generally compete favorably against our competitors in these areas 
however  lack of name recognition may be a concern with potential new customers 
competitor solutions may be more attractive than ours to the extent they are integrated with a larger product solution such as outsourced email 
in addition  our pricing may be less competitive  particularly compared to smaller competitors trying to enter the market 
our principal competitors in the corporate market are set forth below system security market 
our principal competitors in this market are symantec corp  trend micro  inc  microsoft corporation and sophos plc 
network security market 
our principal competitors in the network protection market are cisco systems  inc  ibm  juniper networks  inc  symantec corp  blue coat systems  inc  websense  inc  microsoft corporation  trend micro  inc  barracuda networks inc  check point software technologies ltd  sourcefire  inc  com corporation  emc corporation and various search engine providers  principally google  inc and yahoo  inc 
vulnerability and risk management security market 
our principal competitors in the vulnerability and risk management market are ibm  qualys and ncircle 
other competitors 
in addition to competition from large technology companies such as ibm  novell  inc and microsoft corporation  we also face competition from smaller companies and shareware authors that may develop competing products 
in the consumer market  we believe that the principal competitive factors include  but are not limited to  the following brand name recognition and reputation  convenience of purchase  price  breadth of functionality and 
table of contents features  ease of use  and frequency of upgrades and updates 
our principal competitors are symantec corp 
with their norton product line  microsoft corporation  kaspersky  avg  trend micro  inc  f secure corporation and ahnlab inc we believe that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas 
however  if it is more convenient for consumers to use a competitive product for example  when they purchase computers that are prebundled with a competitor s product  we could be at a competitive disadvantage 
our prices are also a competitive disadvantage compared to free solutions or when competitors offer limited time promotions 
for example  microsoft recently announced that in it will begin offering a free anti malware product in emerging markets 
there are also several smaller regional security companies that we compete against primarily in the emea and asia pacific regions 
our proprietary technology our success depends to a great extent on our proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets and copyrights to establish and protect proprietary rights to our software 
however  the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary software technology may be inadequate to deter misuse or theft of this technology 
often  we do not obtain signed license agreements from customers who license products from us 
in these cases  we include an electronic version of an end user license in all of our electronically distributed software and a printed license with our products that are distributed in a box 
although this is common practice for software companies that sell off the shelf products to have licenses that are not signed by the licensee  certain legal authorities believe that such licenses may not be enforceable under the laws of many states and foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect these rights at all or offer only limited protection for these rights 
furthermore  we are aware that a significant number of users of our anti virus products have not paid any license or support fees to us 
see risk factors we face numerous risks relating to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights and our use of third party intellectual property  many of which could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights as well as other material adverse impacts on our business and financial results and condition below 
seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  our business is seasonal 
software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth quarters and lower in our first and second quarters 
a significant decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel 
revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met and a large portion of our revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
our employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals worldwide  with approximately in the us less than of our employees are represented by a labor union or work council 
competition for qualified management and technical personnel is intense in the software industry

item a 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
some but not all of the risks we face are described below 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows and reduce the value of an investment in our common stock 
adverse conditions in the national and global economies and financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial results 
national and global economies and financial markets have experienced a severe downturn stemming from a multitude of factors  including adverse credit conditions impacted by the sub prime mortgage crisis  slower or receding economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  fluctuating energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns and other factors 
economic growth in the us and many other countries slowed or receded in the fourth quarter of the severity or length of time these economic and financial market conditions may persist is unknown 
during challenging economic times and in tight credit markets  many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers 
specific economic trends  such as declines in the demand for pcs  servers  and other computing devices  or softness in corporate information technology spending  could have a more direct impact on our business 
any of these events would likely harm our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
we face intense competition and we expect competitive pressures to increase in the future 
this competition could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and we expect both product and pricing competition to increase 
if our competitors gain market share in the markets for our products  our sales could grow more slowly or decline 
competitive pressures could also lead to increases in expenses such as advertising expenses  product rebates  product placement fees  and marketing funds provided to our channel partners 
advantages of larger competitors 
our principal competitors in each of our product categories are described in business competition above 
our competitors include some large enterprises such as microsoft  cisco systems  symantec  ibm  google and trend micro 
large vendors of hardware or operating system software increasingly incorporate system and network protection functionality into their products  and enhance that functionality either through internal development or through strategic alliances or acquisitions 
for example  cisco recently announced an agreement with trend micro to embed internet security software on cisco s linksys wireless routers 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  more extensive international operations  greater name recognition  larger technical staffs  established relationships with more distributors and hardware 
table of contents vendors  significantly greater product development and acquisition budgets  and or greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
consumer business competition 
more than of our revenue comes from our consumer business 
our growth of this business relies on direct sales and sales through relationships with isps such as aol  cox and comcast  and pc oems  such as acer  dell  sony computer and toshiba 
as competition in this market increases  we have and will continue to experience pricing pressures that could have a negative effect on our ability to sustain our revenue and market share growth 
as our consumer business becomes increasingly more dependent upon the partner model  our retail businesses may continue to decline 
further  as penetration of the consumer anti virus market through the isp model increases  we expect that pricing and competitive pressures in this market will become even more acute 
low priced or free competitive products 
security protection is increasingly being offered by third parties at significant discounts to our prices or  in some cases is bundled for free 
for example  microsoft announced that beginning in it will offer in emerging markets a free anti malware consumer product dubbed morro 
the widespread inclusion of lower priced or free products that perform the same or similar functions as our products within computer hardware or other companies software products could reduce the perceived need for our products or render our products unmarketable even if these incorporated products are inferior or more limited than our products 
it is possible that a major competitor may offer a free anti malware enterprise product 
the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results 
we also face competition from numerous smaller companies  shareware and freeware authors and open source projects that may develop competing products  as well as from future competitors  currently unknown to us  who may enter the markets because the barriers to entry are fairly low 
smaller and or newer companies often compete aggressively on price 
we face product development risks due to rapid changes in our industry 
failure to keep pace with these changes could harm our business and financial results 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological developments  continually evolving industry trends and standards and ongoing changes in customer requirements 
our success depends on our ability to timely and effectively keep pace with these developments 
keeping pace with industry changes 
we must enhance and expand our product offerings to reflect industry trends  new technologies and new operating environments as they become increasingly important to customer deployments 
for example  we must expand our offerings for virtual computer environments  we must continue to expand our security technologies for mobile environments to support a broader range of mobile devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants  we must develop products that are compatible with new or otherwise emerging operating systems  while remaining compatible with popular operating systems such as linux  sun s solaris  unix  macintosh os x  and windows xp  nt and vista  and we must continue to expand our business models beyond traditional software licensing and subscription models  specifically  software as a service is becoming an increasingly important method and business model for the delivery of applications 
we must also continuously work to ensure that our products meet changing industry certifications and standards 
failure to keep pace with any changes that are important to our customers could cause us to lose customers and could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
impact of product development delays or competitive announcements 
our ability to adapt to changes can be hampered by product development delays 
we may experience delays in product development as we have at times in the past 
complex products like ours may contain undetected errors or version compatibility problems  particularly when first released  which could delay or adversely impact market acceptance 
we may also experience delays or unforeseen costs associated with integrating products we acquire with products we develop because we may be unfamiliar with errors or compatibility issues of products we did not develop ourselves 
we may choose not to deliver a partially developed product  thereby increasing our development costs without a corresponding benefit 
this could negatively impact our business 

table of contents if our products do not work properly  we could experience negative publicity  damage to our reputation  legal liability  declining sales and increased expenses 
failure to protect against security breaches 
because of the complexity of our products  we have in the past found errors in versions of our products that were not detected before first introduced  or in new versions or enhancements  and we may find such errors in the future 
because of the complexity of the environments in which our products operate  our products may have errors or defects that customers identify after deployment 
failures  errors or defects in our products could result in security breaches or compliance violations for our customers  disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity  damage to our reputation  declining sales  increased expenses and customer relation issues 
such failures could also result in product liability damage claims against us by our customers  even though our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
furthermore  the correction of defects could divert the attention of engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
a major security breach at one of our customers that is attributable to or not preventable by our products could be very damaging to our business 
any actual or perceived breach of network or computer security at one of our customers  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  could adversely affect the market s perception of our security products 
false alarms 
our system protection software products have in the past  and these products and our intrusion protection products may at times in the future  falsely detect viruses or computer threats that do not actually exist 
these false alarms  while typical in the security industry  would likely impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products 
in addition  we have in the past been subject to litigation claiming damages related to a false alarm  and similar claims may be made in the future 
our email and web solutions anti spam  anti spyware and safe search products may falsely identify emails  programs or web sites as unwanted spam  potentially unwanted programs or unsafe 
they may also fail to properly identify unwanted emails  programs or unsafe web sites  particularly because spam emails  spyware or malware are often designed to circumvent anti spam or spyware products and to incorrectly identify legitimate web sites as unsafe 
parties whose emails or programs are incorrectly blocked by our products  or whose web sites are incorrectly identified as unsafe or as utilizing phishing techniques  may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or unsafe and or for interfering with their businesses 
in addition  false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may discourage potential customers from using or continuing to use these products 
customer misuse of products 
our products may also not work properly if they are misused or abused by customers or non customer third parties who obtain access and use of our products 
these situations may arise where an organization uses our products in a manner that impacts their end users or employees privacy or where our products are misappropriated to censor private access to the internet 
any of these situations could impact the perceived reliability of our products  result in negative press coverage  negatively affect our reputation and adversely impact our financial results 
we face risks associated with past and future acquisitions 
we may buy or make investments in complementary or competitive companies  products and technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 
future acquisitions could result in significant acquisition related charges and dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  we face a number of risks relating to our acquisitions  including the following  any of which could harm our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our past or future acquisitions 
integration 
integration of an acquired company or technology is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
the successful integration of an acquisition requires  among other things  that we integrate and retain key management  sales  research and development and other personnel  integrate the acquired products into our product offerings from both an engineering and sales and marketing perspective  integrate and support pre existing suppliers  distribution and customer relationships  coordinate research and development efforts  and consolidate duplicate facilities and functions and integrate back office accounting  order processing and support functions 

table of contents the geographic distance between the companies  the complexity of the technologies and operations being integrated and the disparate corporate cultures being combined may increase the difficulties of integrating an acquired company or technology 
management s focus on the integration of operations may distract attention from our day to day business and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
in addition  it is common in the technology industry for aggressive competitors to attract customers and recruit key employees away from companies during the integration phase of an acquisition 
if integration of our acquired businesses or assets is not successful  we may experience adverse financial or competitive effects 
internal controls  policies and procedures 
acquired companies or businesses are likely to have different standards  controls  contracts  procedures and policies  making it more difficult to implement and harmonize company wide financial  accounting  billing  information and other systems 
acquisitions of privately held and or non us companies are particularly challenging because their prior practices in these areas may not meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and public accounting standards 
use of cash and securities 
our available cash and securities may be used to acquire or invest in companies or products 
moreover  when we acquire a company  we may have to incur or assume that company s liabilities  including liabilities that may not be fully known at the time of acquisition 
to the extent we continue to make acquisitions  we will require additional cash and or shares of our common stock as payment 
the use of securities would cause dilution for our existing stockholders 
key employees from acquired companies may be difficult to retain and assimilate 
the success of many acquisitions depends to a great extent on our ability to retain key employees from the acquired company 
this can be challenging  particularly in the highly competitive market for technical personnel 
retaining key executives for the long term can also be difficult due to other opportunities available to them 
it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to replace any key management members or other critical personnel that do not accept employment with mcafee following the acquisition 
in addition to retaining key employees  we must integrate them into our company  which can be difficult and costly 
changes in management or other critical personnel may be disruptive to our business and might also result in our loss of some unique skills and the departure of existing employees and or customers 
accounting charges 
acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses  write offs of in process research and development  amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation expense  any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
potential goodwill impairment 
we perform an impairment analysis on our goodwill balances on an annual basis or whenever events occur that may indicate impairment 
if the fair value of each of our reporting units is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then we must write down goodwill to its estimated fair value 
we cannot be certain that a future downturn in our business  changes in market conditions or a long term decline in the quoted market price of our stock will not result in an impairment of goodwill and the recognition of resulting expenses in future periods  which could adversely affect our results of operations for those periods 
establishment of vsoe 
following an acquisition  we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue that we receive from the sale of products that we acquired  or from the sale of a bundle of products that includes products that we acquired  if we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the separate value of the acquired product 
a delay in the recognition of revenue from sales of acquired products or bundles that include acquired products may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 
similarly  companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures  which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our operating margins 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
our international operations involve risks that could divert the time and attention of management  increase our expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial results 
our international operations increase our risks in several aspects of our business  including but not limited to risks relating to revenue  legal and compliance  currency exchange and interest rate  and general operating 
net 
table of contents revenue in our operating regions outside of north america represented of total net revenue in in comparison to in and in the risks associated with our continued focus on international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 
revenue risks 
revenue risks include  among others  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonality  currency fluctuations  and the high incidence of software piracy and fraud in some countries 
the primary product development risk to our revenue is our ability to deliver new products in a timely manner and to successfully localize our products for a significant number of international markets in different languages 
legal and compliance risks 
we face a variety of legal and compliance risks 
for example  international operations pose a compliance risk with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
some countries have a reputation for businesses to engage in prohibited practices with government officials to consummate transactions 
although we have implemented training along with policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with this and similar laws  there can be no assurance that all employees and third party intermediaries will comply with anti corruption laws 
any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
another legal risk is that some of our computer security solutions incorporate encryption technology that is governed by us export regulations 
the cost of compliance with those regulations can affect our ability to sell certain products in certain markets and could have a material adverse effect on our international revenue and expense 
if we  or our resellers  fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may become subject to penalties and fines or restrictions that may adversely affect our business 
other legal risks include international labor laws and our relationship with our employees and regional work councils  compliance with more stringent consumer protection and privacy laws  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
our principal tax risks are potentially adverse tax consequences due to foreign value added taxes  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and changes in tax laws 
currency exchange and interest rate risks 
a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies 
we translate revenues and costs from these transactions into us dollars for reporting purposes 
as a result  our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
this combined with economic instability  such as higher interest rates in the us and inflation  could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products  or could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries 
during and  we recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and a net foreign currency transaction loss of million in we may be positively or negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates will impact our deferred revenue balance  which is a key financial metric at each period end 
general operating risks 
more general risks of international business operations include the increased costs of establishing  managing and coordinating the activities of geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations particularly sales and support and shared service centers located on multiple continents in a wide range of time zones 
we face a number of risks related to our product sales through distributors and other third parties 
we sell substantially all of our products through third party intermediaries such as distributors  value added resellers  pc oems  isps and other distribution channel partners referred to collectively as distributors 
reliance on third parties for distribution exposes us to a variety of risks  some of which are described below  that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
limited control over timing of product delivery 
we have limited control over the timing of the delivery of our products to customers by third party distributors 
we generally do not require our resellers and oem partners to meet minimum sales volumes  so their sales may vary significantly from period to period 
for example  the volume of our products shipped by our oem partners depends on the volume of computers shipped by the pc oems  which 
table of contents is outside of our control 
these factors can make it difficult for us to forecast our revenue accurately and they also can cause our revenue to fluctuate unpredictably 
competitive aspects of distributor relationships 
our distributors may sell other vendors products that compete with our products 
although we offer our distributors incentives to focus on sales of our products  they often give greater priority to products of our competitors  for a variety of reasons 
in order to maximize sales of our products rather than those of our competitors  we must effectively support these partners with  among other things  appropriate financial incentives to encourage them to invest in sales tools  such as online sales and technical training and product collateral needed to support their customers and prospects 
if we do not properly support our partners  they may focus more on our competitors products  and their sales of our products would decline 
our pc oem partners are also in a position to exert competitive pricing pressure 
competition for oems business continues to increase  and it gives the oems leverage to demand lower product prices from us in order to secure their business 
even if we negotiate what we believe are favorable pricing terms when we first establish a relationship with an oem  at the time of the renewal of the agreement  we may be required to renegotiate our agreement with them on less favorable terms 
lower net prices for our products would adversely impact our operating margins 
reliance on a small number of distributors 
a significant portion of our net revenue is attributable to a fairly small number of distributors 
our top ten distributors represented of our net revenue in  in and in reliance on a relatively small number of third parties for a significant portion of our distribution exposes us to significant risks to net revenue and net income if our relationship with one or more of our key distributors is terminated for any reason 
risk of loss of distributors 
we invest significant time  money and resources to establish and maintain relationships with our distributors  but we have no assurance that any particular relationship will continue for any specific period of time 
the agreements we have with our distributors can generally be terminated by either party without cause with no or minimal notice or penalties 
if any significant distributor terminates its agreement with us  we could experience a significant interruption in the distribution of our products and our revenue could decline 
we could also lose the benefit of our investment of time  money and resources in the distributor relationship 
although a distributor can terminate its relationship with us for any reason  one factor that may lead to termination is a divergence of our business interests and those of our distributors and potential conflicts of interest 
for example  our acquisition activity has resulted in the termination of distributor relationships that no longer fit with the distributors business priorities 
future acquisition activity could cause similar termination of  or disruption in  our distributor relationships  which could adversely impact our revenue 
credit risk 
some of our distributors may experience financial difficulties  which could adversely impact our collection of accounts receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million as of december  we regularly review the collectability and credit worthiness of our distributors to determine an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
our uncollectible accounts could exceed our current or future allowances  which could adversely impact our financial results 
we also face legal and compliance risks with respect to our use of third party intermediaries operating outside the united states 
as described above in our international operations involve risks that could divert the time and attention of management  increase our expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial results  any violations by such third party intermediaries of fcpa or similar laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we face numerous risks relating to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights and our use of third party intellectual property  many of which could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights as well as other material adverse impacts on our business and financial results and condition 
limited protection of our intellectual property rights against potential infringers 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and copyrights to establish and protect proprietary rights in our software 
however  the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary software may not deter its misuse  theft or misappropriation 
competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are 
table of contents substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that inappropriately incorporate our proprietary technology into their products 
we are aware that a number of users of our security products have not paid license  technical support  or subscription fees to us 
certain jurisdictions may not provide adequate legal infrastructure for effective protection of our intellectual property rights 
changing legal interpretations of liability for unauthorized use of our software or lessened sensitivity by corporate  government or institutional users to refraining from intellectual property piracy or other infringements of intellectual property could also harm our business 
frequency  expense and risks of intellectual property litigation in the network and system security market 
litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect our trade secrets  patents and other intellectual property rights 
similarly  we may be required to defend against claimed infringement by others 
for example  as discussed in item  legal proceedings  we recently settled a patent infringement case that sought to prevent us from selling certain of our products 
the security technology industry has increasingly been subject to patent and other intellectual property rights litigation  particularly from special purpose entities that seek to monetize their intellectual property rights by asserting claims against others 
as we become a larger and more profitable company  we can expect this trend to accelerate 
for example  as discussed in item  legal proceedings  we recently settled a patent infringement case that sought to prevent us from selling certain of our products 
we expect this trend to continue and that in the future we will be required to defend against this type of litigation 
the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties  so we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position 
in addition to the expense and distraction associated with litigation  adverse determinations could cause us to lose our proprietary rights  prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  require us to obtain licenses to patents or other intellectual property rights that our products are alleged to infringe licenses may not be available on reasonable commercial terms or at all  and subject us to significant liabilities 
if we acquire technology to include in our products from third parties  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties to verify the origin and ownership of such technology 
similarly  we face exposure to infringement actions if we hire software engineers who were previously employed by competitors and those employees inadvertently or deliberately incorporate proprietary technology of our competitors into our products despite efforts by our competitors and us to prevent such infringement 
litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect our trade secrets  patents and other intellectual property rights 
potential risks of using open source software 
like many other software companies  we use and distribute open source software in order to expedite development of new products 
open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses  including  for example  the gnu general public license 
these license terms may be ambiguous  in many instances have not been interpreted by the courts and could be interpreted in a manner that results in unanticipated obligations regarding our products 
depending upon how the open source software is deployed by our developers  we could be required to offer our products that use the open source software for no cost  or make available the source code for modifications or derivative works 
any of these obligations could have an adverse impact on our intellectual property rights and revenue from products incorporating the open source software 
our use of open source code could also result in us developing and selling products that infringe third party intellectual property rights 
it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the code incorporates proprietary software 
we have processes and controls in place that are designed to address these risks and concerns  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source 
however  we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
we also have processes and controls in place to review the use of open source in the products developed by companies that we acquire 
despite having conducted appropriate due diligence prior to completing the acquisition  products or technologies that we acquire may nonetheless include open source software that was not identified during the initial due diligence 
our ability to commercialize products or technologies of acquired companies that 
table of contents incorporate open source software or to otherwise fully realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may be restricted for the reasons described in the preceding two paragraphs 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition to intellectual property litigation  from time to time  we have been  and may be in the future  subject to other litigation including stockholder derivative actions or actions brought by current or former employees 
if we continue to make acquisitions in the future  we are more likely to be subject to acquisition related shareholder derivative actions 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that an adverse liability resulting from such litigation is probable  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of the inherent uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
in addition to the related cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could cause the diversion of management s attention 
in this regard  we and a number of our current and former officers and directors are involved in or the subject of various legal actions 
managing  defending and indemnity obligations related to these actions have caused significant diversion of management s and the board of directors time and resulted in material expense to us 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to currently pending legal matters 
our financial results can fluctuate significantly  making it difficult for us to accurately estimate operating results 
impact of fluctuations 
over the years our revenue  gross margins and operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and we expect this to continue in the future 
thus  our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 
these fluctuations make it difficult for us to accurately forecast operating results 
we try to adjust expenses based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue  but in the short term expenses are relatively fixed 
this makes it difficult for us to adjust our expenses in time to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall in a given period 
volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
factors that may cause our revenue  gross margins and other operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period  include  but are not limited to  the following establishment of vsoe 
we may in the future sell products for which we have not established vsoe and would be required to delay the recognition of revenue 
a delay in the recognition of revenue from sales of products may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results and may adversely affect our operating margins 
timing of product orders 
a significant portion of our revenue in any quarter comes from previously deferred revenue  which is a somewhat predictable component of our quarterly revenue 
however  a meaningful part of revenue depends on contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in the current quarter 
typically we generate the most orders in the last month of each quarter 
some customers believe they can enhance their bargaining power by waiting until the end of our quarter to place their order 
also  personnel limitations and system processing constraints could adversely impact our ability to process the large number of orders that typically occur near the end of a quarter 
any failure or delay in closing significant new orders in a given quarter could have a material adverse impact on our results for that quarter 
reliability and timeliness of expense data 
we increasingly rely upon third party manufacturers to manufacture our hardware based products  therefore  our reliance on their ability to provide us with timely and accurate product cost information exposes us to risk  negatively impacting our ability to accurately and timely report our operating results 

table of contents issues relating to third party distribution  manufacturing and fulfillment relationships 
we rely heavily on third parties to manufacture and distribute our products 
any changes in the performance of these relationships can impact our operating results 
changes in our supply chain could result in product fulfillment delays that contribute to fluctuations in operating results from period to period 
we have in the past and may in the future make changes in our product delivery network  which may disrupt our ability to timely and efficiently meet our product delivery commitments  particularly at the end of a quarter 
as a result  we may experience increased costs in the short term as temporary delivery solutions are implemented to address unanticipated delays in product delivery 
in addition  product delivery delays may negatively impact our ability to recognize revenue if shipments are delayed at the end of a quarter 
product mix 
another source of fluctuations in our operating results and  in particular  gross profit margins  is the mix of products we sell and services we offer  including the mix between corporate versus consumer products  hardware based compared to software based products  perpetual licenses versus subscription licenses  and maintenance and support services compared to consulting services or product revenue 
product mix can impact operating expenses as well as the amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition  so our profitability can fluctuate significantly 
timing of new products and customers 
the timing of the introduction and adoption of new products  product upgrades or updates can have a significant impact on revenue from period to period 
for example  revenue tends to be higher in periods shortly after we introduce new products compared to periods without new products 
our revenue may decline after new product introductions by competitors 
in addition  the volume  size  and terms of new customer licenses can cause fluctuations in our revenue 
additional cash and non cash sources of fluctuations 
a number of other factors that are peripheral to our core business operations also contribute to variability in our operating results 
these include  but are not limited to  expenses related to our acquisition and disposition activities  stock based compensation expense  unanticipated costs associated with litigation or investigations  costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  costs and charges related to certain extraordinary events such as restructurings  substantial declines in estimated values of long lived assets below the value at which they are reflected in our financial statements  and changes in generally accepted accounting principles 
material weaknesses in our internal control and financial reporting environment may impact the accuracy  completeness and timeliness of our external financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal control and financial reporting environment 
during the year ended december   our management completed the corrective actions to remediate a material weakness in accounting for income taxes discussed in our form k and form k 
these remediation efforts resulted in additional costs and diverted management attention away from operating our business 
if management identifies any material weaknesses in the future  their correction could require remedial measures which could be costly and time consuming 
in addition  the presence of material weaknesses could result in financial statement errors which in turn could require us to restate our operating results 
this in turn could damage investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could affect our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation 
our strategic alliances and our relationships with manufacturing partners expose us to a range of business risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
uncertainty of realizing anticipated benefit of strategic alliances 
we have entered into strategic alliances with numerous third parties to support our future growth plans 
for example  these relationships may include technology licensing  joint technology development and integration  research cooperation  co marketing activities and sell through arrangements 
we face a number of risks relating to our strategic alliances  including those described below 
these risks may prevent us from realizing the desired benefits from our strategic alliances on a timely basis or at all  which could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 

table of contents challenges relating to integrated products from strategic alliances 
strategic alliances require significant coordination between the parties involved  particularly if an alliance requires that we integrate their products with our products 
this could involve significant time and expenditure by our technical staff and the technical staff of our strategic partner 
the integration of products from different companies may be more difficult than we anticipate  and the risk of integration difficulties  incompatible products and undetected programming errors or defects may be higher than that normally associated with new products 
the marketing and sale of products that result from strategic alliances might also be more difficult than that normally associated with new products 
sales and marketing personnel may require special training  as the new products may be more complex than our other products 
we invest significant time  money and resources to establish and maintain relationships with our strategic partners  but we have no assurance that any particular relationship will continue for any specific period of time 
generally  our strategic alliance agreements are terminable without cause with no or minimal notice or penalties 
if we lose a significant strategic partner  we could lose the benefit of our investment of time  money and resources in the relationship 
in addition  we could be required to incur significant expenses to develop a new strategic alliance or to determine and implement an alternative plan to pursue the opportunity that we targeted with the former partner 
less control of the manufacturing process and outcome with third party manufacturing relationships 
we rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture some of our hardware based network protection and system protection products 
we expect the number of our hardware based products and our reliance on third party manufacturers to increase as we continue to expand these types of solutions 
we also rely on third parties to replicate and package our boxed software products 
this reliance on third parties involves a number of risks that could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
these risks include  but are not limited to  lack of control over the quality and timing of the manufacturing process  limited control over the cost of manufacturing  and the potential absence or unavailability of adequate manufacturing capacity 
risk of inadequate capacity with third party manufacturing relationships 
if any of our third party manufacturers fails for any reason to manufacture products of acceptable quality  in required volumes  and in a cost effective and timely manner  it could be costly as well as disruptive to product shipments 
we might be required to seek additional manufacturing capacity  which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
even if additional capacity was available  the process of qualifying a new vendor could be lengthy and could cause significant delays in product shipments and could strain partner and customer relationships 
in addition  supply disruptions or cost increases could increase our costs of goods sold and negatively impact our financial performance 
our risk is relatively greater in situations where our hardware products contain critical components supplied by a single or a limited number of third parties 
any significant shortage of components could lead to cancellations of customer orders or delays in placement of orders  which would adversely impact revenue 
risk of hardware obsolescence with third party manufacturing relationships 
hardware based products may face greater obsolescence risks than software products 
we could incur losses or other charges in disposing of obsolete hardware inventory 
in addition  to the extent that our third party manufacturers upgrade or otherwise alter their manufacturing processes  our hardware based products could face supply constraints or risks associated with the transition of hardware based products to new platforms 
this could increase the risk of losses or other charges associated with obsolete inventory 
our global operations may expose us to tax risk 
we are generally required to account for taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process may require us to make assumptions  interpretations and judgments with respect to the meaning and application of promulgated tax laws and related administrative and judicial interpretations 
the positions that we take and our interpretations of the tax laws may differ from the positions and interpretations of the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are presently under examination in many jurisdictions  including notably the us  california  germany and the netherlands 
an adverse outcome in one or more of these ongoing examinations  or in any future examinations that may occur  could have a significant negative impact on our cash position and net income 
although we have established reserves for these examination contingencies  there can be no assurance that the reserves will be sufficient to cover our ultimate liabilities 

table of contents our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and can be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to changes in tax laws  regulations and accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions  or interpretations of those changes 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for income taxes fin 
in addition  fin applies to all income tax positions  including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or recorded goodwill 
critical personnel may be difficult to attract  assimilate and retain 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain senior management personnel  as well as technically qualified and highly skilled sales  consulting  technical  finance and marketing personnel 
other than members of executive management who have at will employment agreements  our employees are not typically subject to an employment agreement or non competition agreement 
it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to locate  replace and integrate any key management member or other critical personnel 
changes in management or other critical personnel may be disruptive to our business and might also result in our loss of unique skills and the departure of existing employees and or customers 
other personnel related issues that we may encounter include competition for personnel  need for competitive pay packages 
competition for qualified individuals in our industry is intense and we must provide competitive compensation packages  including equity awards 
increases in shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans require stockholder approval  and there may be times  as we have seen in the past  where we may not obtain the necessary approval 
also  we may continue the trend of granting fewer stock options and more restricted stock awards rsas  restricted stock units rsus  or restricted stock units with performance based vesting psus  which could adversely impact our results of operations due to the accounting charges required in connection with equity compensation and the dilutive impact on earnings per share 
risks relating to senior management changes and new hires 
from to  we experienced significant changes in our senior management team as a number of officers resigned or were terminated and several key management positions were vacant for a significant period of time 
we may continue to experience changes in senior management going forward 
we continue to hire in key areas and have added a number of new employees in connection with our acquisitions 
for new employees  including senior management  there may be reduced levels of productivity as it takes time for new hires to be trained or otherwise assimilated into the company 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and negatively impact our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenue  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  service disruptions  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts  or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
we face risks related to customer outsourcing to system integrators 
some of our customers have outsourced the management of their information technology departments to large system integrators 
if this trend continues  our established customer relationships could be disrupted and our 
table of contents products could be displaced by alternative system and network protection solutions offered by system integrators that do not bundle our solutions 
significant product displacements could negatively impact our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to effectively upgrade or modify our information technology system  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded information technology systems and in applying maintenance patches to existing systems  including loss of data and decreases in productivity as personnel become familiar with new  upgraded or modified systems 
our management information systems will require modification and refinement as we grow and as our business needs change  which could prolong the difficulties we experience with systems transitions  and we may not always employ the most effective systems for our purposes 
if we experience difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or experience significant system failures  or if we are unable to successfully modify our management information systems and respond to changes in our business needs  our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations 
we may also experience similar results if we have difficulty applying routine maintenance patches to existing systems in a timely manner 
computer hackers may damage our products  services and systems 
due to our high profile in the network and system protection market  we have been a target of computer hackers who have  among other things  created viruses to sabotage or otherwise attack our products and services  including our various web sites 
for example  we have seen the spread of viruses  or worms  that intentionally delete anti virus and firewall software 
similarly  hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services 
also  a number of web sites have been subject to denial of service attacks  where a web site is bombarded with information requests eventually causing the web site to overload  resulting in a delay or disruption of service 
if successful  any of these events could damage users or our own computer systems 
in addition  since we do not control disk duplication by distributors or our independent agents  media containing our software may be infected with viruses 
business interruptions may impede our operations and the operations of our customers 
we are continually updating or modifying our accounting and other internal and external facing business systems 
modifications of these types of systems are often disruptive to business and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate 
failure to properly manage this process could materially harm our business operations 
in addition  we and our customers face a number of potential business interruption risks that are beyond our respective control 
natural disasters or other events could interrupt our business or the business of our customers  and each of us is reliant on external infrastructure that may be antiquated 
our corporate headquarters in california is located near a major earthquake fault 
the potential impact of a major earthquake on our facilities  infrastructure and overall operations is not known  but could be quite severe 
despite business interruption and disaster recovery programs that have been implemented  an earthquake could seriously disrupt our entire business process 
we are largely uninsured for losses and business disruptions caused by an earthquake and other natural disasters 
our investment portfolio is subject to volatility  losses and liquidity limitations 
continued negative conditions in the global credit markets could impair the value of or limit our access to our investments 
investment income has been a significant component of our net income 
the ability to achieve our investment objectives is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings 
while our investment policy and strategy attempt to manage interest rate risk  limit credit risk  and only invest in what we view as very high quality debt securities  the outlook for our investment holdings is dependent on general economic conditions  interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace  which can all affect the income that we receive  the value of our investments  and our ability to sell them 
current economic conditions have had widespread negative effects on the financial markets and global economies 
during these challenging markets  we are investing new cash in instruments with short to medium term 
table of contents maturities of highly rated issuers  including us government and fdic guaranteed investments 
we do not hold any sub prime mortgages  auction rate securities or structured investment vehicles 
the outlook for our investment income is dependent on the amount of any share repurchases or acquisitions that we effect and the amount of cash flows from operations that are available for investment 
our investment income is also affected by the yield on our investments and our recent shift to a larger percentage of our investment portfolio to shorter term and us government and fdic guaranteed investments 
this shift may negatively impact our income from our investment portfolio in light of declining yields 
any significant decline in our investment income or the value of our investments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
during  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to marketable securities 
we believe that our investment securities are carried at fair value 
however  over time the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities which could change our judgment regarding impairment 
this could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines being charged against future income 
given the current market conditions involved  there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional impairments may be charged to income in future periods  resulting in realized losses 
most of our cash and investments held outside the us are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a repatriation of these non us investment holdings to the non us under current law could be subject to foreign and us federal income and withholding taxes  less any applicable foreign tax credits 
these tax limitations  local regulations and potential further capital market turmoil could limit our ability to utilize these offshore funds 
our historical stock option granting practices have resulted in  and could continue to result in  continued or new litigation  regulatory proceedings  government enforcement actions and remedial actions  all of which have had  and could in the future have  a negative impact on our business and financial results 
shortly after we announced an internal investigation of our historical stock option granting practices in may  both the sec and the united states department of justice doj commenced investigations of our stock option practices 
we have been engaged in discussions with and have provided information to the sec regarding certain of our prior period consolidated financial statements 
the resolution of the sec inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices could require us to file additional restatements of our prior consolidated financial statements or require that we take other actions not presently contemplated 
as part of the remedial actions we have taken in connection with the investigation and restatement of our consolidated financial statements  we terminated certain employees  including former executive officers 
we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings in connection with one such termination 
any future legal proceedings could require additional management time and additional expense  and may require us to make settlement or other related payments in the future 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for more details about ongoing legal proceedings 
we cannot predict the outcome of the pending government inquiries or other lawsuits  and we may face additional government inquiries and other legal proceedings 
any such litigation  government inquiry or other legal proceeding could require us to devote significant management time and to incur significant accounting  legal  and other expenses and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
during and up to the date of this filing  our stock price was highly volatile  ranging from a high of to a low of 
on february   our stock s closing price was 
announcements  business developments  such as a material acquisitions or dispositions  litigation developments and our ability to meet the expectations of investors with respect to our operating and financial results  may contribute to current and future stock price volatility 
in addition  third party announcements such as those made by our partners and competitors may contribute to current and future stock price volatility 
for example  future announcements by major competitors related to consumer and corporate security solutions may contribute to future volatility in our stock price 
certain types of investors may choose not to invest in stocks with this level of stock price volatility 

table of contents our stock price may also experience volatility that is completely unrelated to our performance or that of the security industry 
during through january  the major us and international stock markets have been extremely volatile 
fluctuations in these broad market indices can impact our stock price regardless of our performance 
our charter documents and delaware law may impede or discourage a takeover  which could lower our stock price 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and could have the effect of discouraging a change of control of the company or changes in management 
delaware law and other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could also delay or make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us or changes in our board of directors and management more difficult

table of contents overview and executive summary we are a leading dedicated security technology company that secures systems and networks from known and unknown threats around the world 
we empower home users  businesses  government agencies  service providers and our partners with the latest technology available in order to block attacks  prevent disruptions  and continuously track and improve their security 
we also provide software to manage and enforce security policies for organizations of all sizes 
finally  we provide expert services and technical support to ensure that our solutions actively meet our customers needs 
these integrated solutions help our customers solve problems  enhance security and reduce costs 
we have one business and operate in one industry developing  marketing  distributing and supporting computer security solutions for large enterprises  governments  small and medium sized businesses and consumers either directly or through a network of qualified distribution partners 
we derive our revenue from three sources i service and support revenue  which includes maintenance  training and consulting revenue  ii subscription revenue  which consists of revenue from customers who purchase licenses for products for the term of the subscription  and iii product revenue  which includes revenue from perpetual licenses those with a one time license fee and from hardware product sales 
in  service and support revenue accounted for of net revenue  subscription revenue accounted for and product revenue accounted for of net revenue 
operating results and trends we evaluate our consolidated financial performance utilizing a variety of indicators 
three of the primary indicators that we utilize to evaluate the growth and health of our business are total net revenue  operating income and net income 
net revenue 
as discussed more fully below  our net revenue in the grew by million  or  to  million from  million in our net revenue is directly impacted by corporate information technology  government and consumer spending levels 
net revenue was positively impacted by million from our and acquisitions 
changes in the us dollar compared to foreign currencies positively impacted our revenue growth by million in operating income 
the million increase in operating income in compared to was primarily attributable to the overall growth of the company and a million reduction in our sec and compliance costs associated with our completed investigation into our historical stock option granting practices  offset by a million increase in amortization of purchased technology  patents and intangibles due to recent acquisitions and a million increase in in process research and development expense related to the secure computing acquisition 
net income 
the million increase in net income in compared to was primarily attributable to the overall growth of the company and a decrease in our effective tax rate discussed in provision for income taxes below  offset by a million decrease in interest income attributable to lower yields and lower cash and marketable securities and an million impairment recorded on marketable securities 
acquisitions 
we continue to focus our efforts on building a full line of system and network protection solutions and technologies that support our multi platform strategy of personal computer  internet and mobile security solutions 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired secure computing for approximately million 
with the secure computing acquisition  we plan to deliver the industry s most complete network security solution to businesses of all sizes 
we expect that the acquisition of secure computing will have a dilutive impact in  primarily due to the amortization of intangibles 
during  we acquired safeboot holding bv for approximately million 
with this acquisition  we provide customers with endpoint  network  web  email and data security  including encryption  as well as risk and compliance solutions 
net revenue by product groups and customer category 
transactions from our corporate business include the sale of product offerings intended for enterprise  mid market and small business use 
net revenue from our corporate products increased million  or  to million during from million in the year over year increase in revenue was due to a increase in revenue from our end point solutions  which includes increased revenue from our system security solutions and new revenue from data encryption products integrated from our safeboot acquisition  a increase in revenue from our network offerings and a increase 
table of contents in revenue from our vulnerability and risk management offerings 
during  net revenue from our corporate products increased million  or  to million from million in the year over year increase in revenue was due to increased revenue from our mcafee total protection solutions and foundstone product lines  and increased maintenance renewals 
transactions from our consumer business include the sale of product offerings primarily intended for consumer use  as well as any revenue or activities associated with providing an overall safe consumer experience on the internet or cellular networks 
net revenue from our consumer security market increased million  or  to million in from million in during  net revenue from our consumer security market increased million  or  to million from million in the increase in revenue from our consumer market in both and was attributable primarily to our strengthening relationships with strategic channel partners  such as aol and dell 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue balance at december  increased to  million  compared to  million at december  the increase was attributable to growing sales of maintenance renewals from our expanding customer base  increased sales of subscription based offerings and acquired deferred revenue primarily from our acquisition of secure computing 
we receive up front payments for maintenance and subscriptions but we recognize revenue over the service or subscription term 
approximately of our total net revenue during came from prior period deferred revenue 
as with revenue  we believe that deferred revenue is a key indicator of the growth and health of our business 
macro economic conditions 
while we have recently experienced strong growth in revenue and bookings  economic conditions and financial markets have become increasingly negative  and national and global economies and financial markets have experienced a severe downturn stemming from a multitude of factors  including adverse credit conditions impacted by the sub prime mortgage crisis  slower economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  fluctuating energy costs  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns and other factors 
economic growth in the us and many other countries slowed in the fourth quarter of  remained slow for and is expected to slow further or to recede in in the us and internationally 
during challenging economic times and in tight credit markets  many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers 
specific economic trends  such as declines in the demand for pcs  servers  and other computing devices  or softness in corporate information technology spending  could have a more direct impact on our business 
any of these events would likely harm our business  including decreasing our revenues  decreasing cash provided by operating activities and negatively impacting our liquidity 
foreign exchange fluctuations 
we are unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign currency rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results 
the euro and japanese yen are the two predominant non us currencies that affect our financial statements 
while the us dollar has strengthened against the euro from january  to december   on an average annual exchange rate basis the us dollar weakened against the euro during  as compared to this has resulted in an increase in the revenue and expense amounts in certain foreign countries in our statements of income for as compared to the prior year 
the us dollar has recently appreciated significantly against the euro and many other foreign currencies  including the local currencies of many of our international customers 
as the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  our revenues from transactions outside the us and operating income may be negatively impacted 
the us dollar has recently depreciated against the japanese yen 
as the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  our revenues may be positively impacted 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  income from operations and net income  as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
to apply critical accounting policies we must evaluate a number of complex criteria and make significant accounting judgments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results were to differ from these estimates materially  the resulting changes could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our significant accounting policies  which are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe the following policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and operating results 
revenue recognition we must make significant management judgments and estimates to determine revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
these estimates affect the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet and the net revenue on our consolidated statement of income 
our revenue  which is presented net of sales taxes  is derived primarily from three sources i service and support revenue  which includes maintenance  training and consulting revenue  ii subscription revenue  which includes revenue from subscription based offerings and iii product revenue  which includes hardware and perpetual licenses revenue 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  and related interpretations to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware products that include software 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for these elements 
for arrangements with multiple elements  including software licenses  maintenance and or services  we allocate and defer revenue equivalent to the vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as product revenue 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately or upon substantive renewal rates stated in a contract 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of stand alone sales of these elements to our customers 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period generally as service and support revenue 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product or service has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for hardware transactions where software is not incidental  we do not separate the license fee and we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
for hardware transactions where no software is involved or software is incidental  we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab 
we enter into perpetual and subscription software license agreements through direct sales to consumer customers and indirect sales with partners  distributors and resellers 
we recognize revenue from the indirect sales channel upon sell through by the partner or distributor 
the license agreements generally include service and support agreements  for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period 
all revenue derived from our online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance 
table of contents period 
professional services revenue is generally recognized as services are performed or if required  upon customer acceptance 
in these situations  we defer the direct costs of the subscription software licensing and professional services arrangements  and amortize those costs over the same period as the related revenue is recognized 
these costs are identified as cost of subscription revenue and cost of service and support revenue on the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 
we also identify the direct and incremental costs associated with product revenues that have been deferred due to lack of vsoe on fair value on an undelivered element 
these costs are primarily hardware platform and other hardware component costs 
we defer these costs at the time of delivery and recognize them as cost of service and support revenue on the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income  in proportion to the product revenue in services and support as it is recognized over the service period 
we reduce revenue for estimates of sales incentives and sales returns 
we offer sales incentives  including channel rebates  marketing funds and end user rebates for products in our corporate and consumer product lines 
additionally  end users may return our products  subject to varying limitations  through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on our historical experience 
in each accounting period  we must make judgments and estimates of sales incentives and potential future sales returns related to current period revenue 
these estimates affect our net revenue line item on our consolidated statement of income and affect our net accounts receivable  deferred revenue or accrued liabilities line items on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   our allowance for sales returns and incentives was million compared to million at december  if our allowance for sales returns and incentives were to increase by  or million  our net revenue would decrease by million and our deferred revenue would decrease by million for the year ended december  stock based compensation expense we record compensation expense for stock based awards issued to employees and outside directors in exchange for services provided based on the estimated fair value of the awards on their grant dates 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the required service or performance period of the awards 
our stock based awards include stock options options  restricted stock units rsus  restricted stock awards rsas  restricted stock units with performance based vesting psus and employee stock purchase rights issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan espp grants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our options and espp grants 
the black scholes model requires estimates of the expected term of the option  as well as future volatility and the risk free interest rate 
we derive the expected term of our options through a lattice model that factors in historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
since january   we have used the implied volatility of options traded on our stock with a term of one year or more to calculate the expected volatility of our option grants 
prior to that time  the expected volatility was based solely on the historical volatility of our stock 
we have not declared any dividends on our stock in the past and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
the assumptions that we have made represent our management s best estimate  but they are highly subjective and inherently uncertain 
if management had made different assumptions  our calculation of the options fair value and the resulting stock based compensation expense could differ  perhaps materially  from the amounts recognized in our financial statements 
for example  if we increased the assumption regarding our stock s volatility for options granted during by  our stock based compensation expense would increase by million  net of expected forfeitures 
likewise  if we increased our assumption of the expected lives of options granted during by one year  our stock based compensation expense would increase by million  net of expected forfeitures 
these notional increased expense amounts would be amortized over the options year vesting period 

table of contents in addition to the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our options  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of all stock based awards and only recognize expense for those awards we expect to vest 
the stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
if we were to change our estimate of forfeiture rates  the amount of stock based compensation expense could differ  perhaps materially  from the amount recognized in our financial statements 
for example  if we had decreased our estimate of expected forfeitures by  our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   net of expected forfeitures  would have increased by million 
this decrease in our estimate of expected forfeitures would increase the amount of expense for all unvested awards that have not yet been recognized by million  amortized over a weighted average period of years 
estimation of restructuring accrual and litigation restructuring accrual 
to determine our restructuring charges and the corresponding liabilities  we make a number of assumptions 
these assumptions included estimated sublease income over the remaining lease period  estimated term of subleases  estimated utility and real estate broker fees  as well as estimated discount rates for use in calculating the present value of our liability 
we develop these assumptions based on our understanding of the current real estate market in the respective locations as well as current market interest rates 
the assumptions used are our management s best estimate at the time of the accrual  and adjustments are made on a periodic basis if better information is obtained 
if  at december   our estimated sublease income were to decrease  the restructuring reserve and related expense would have increased by million 
the estimates regarding our restructuring accruals affect our current liabilities and other long term liabilities line items in our consolidated balance sheet  since these liabilities will be settled each year through these estimates affect our statement of income in the restructuring line item 
litigation 
management s current estimated range of liability related to litigation that is brought against us from time to time is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where there is a range of loss  as there is no better point of estimate 
because of the uncertainties related to an unfavorable outcome of litigation  and the amount and range of loss on pending litigation  management is often unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as litigation progresses  we continue to assess our potential liability and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
estimates of litigation liability affect our accrued liability line item on our consolidated balance sheet and our general and administrative expense line item on our statement of income 
see note in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess and make significant estimates regarding the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
estimates related to income taxes affect the deferred tax asset and liability line items and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and our income tax expense line item in our consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 
our deferred tax asset is presented net of a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is recorded due to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits and net operating losses of acquired companies 
the valuation allowance is based on our historical experience and estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be

in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the valuation allowance decreased in  which included a reduction of million related to utilization of foreign tax credits and various other changes in deferred tax assets  offset by an increase of million related to recording valuation allowance on acquired certain net operating losses associated with the acquisition of secure computing 
tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
although we believe that adequate accruals have been made each period for unsettled issues  additional benefits or expenses could occur in future years from resolution of outstanding matters 
we record additional expenses each period relating to the expected interest and penalties we would be required to pay a tax authority if we do not prevail 
we continue to assess our potential tax liability included in accrued taxes in the consolidated financial statements and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
we have classified a portion of our tax liability as non current in the consolidated balance sheet based on the expected timing of cash payments to settle contingencies with taxing authorities 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles  and long lived assets when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
goodwill 
we make estimates regarding the fair value of our reporting units when testing for potential impairment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
we estimate cash flows for these purposes using internal budgets based on recent and historical trends 
we base these estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we also make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate the carrying value for each of our reporting units 
if an impairment were present  these estimates would affect an impairment line item on our consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income and would affect the goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet 
as goodwill is allocated to all of our reporting units  any impairment could potentially affect each operating geography 
intangibles and long lived assets 
we will record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many of the other factors  which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results 
impairment of marketable securities all marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities 
we assess the value of our available for sale marketable securities on a regular basis to assess whether an other than temporary decline in the fair value has occurred 
this determination requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different than our estimate 
factors which we use to assess whether an other than temporary decline has occurred include  but are not limited to  the likely reason for the unrealized loss  period of time the fair value was below amortized cost  changes in underlying collateral  
table of contents changes in ratings  market trends and conditions  and our intent and ability to hold until we recover such losses 
any other than temporary decline in value is reported in earnings and a new cost basis for the marketable security is established 
in  we recorded an impairment of marketable securities totaling million 
of the million impairment  million related to corporate bonds and asset backed and mortgaged backed securities which suffered declines in fair value  million related to a single corporate bond that had a significant decline in fair value due to the issuer s bankruptcy and million related to impairment recorded because we no longer had the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient for the fair values to recover due to funding our acquisition of secure computing  which was a one time event 
we had no impairment of marketable securities in and at december   gross unrealized losses on our marketable securities totaled million

table of contents our net revenue in a specific period is an aggregation of thousands of transactions ranging from high volume  low dollar transactions to high dollar  multiple element transactions that are individually negotiated 
the impact of pricing and volume changes on revenue is complex as substantially all of our transactions contain multiple elements  primarily software licenses and post contract support pcs 
additionally  approximately of our revenue in a specific period is derived from prior period transactions for which revenue has been deferred and is being amortized into income over the period of the arrangement 
therefore  the impact of pricing and volume changes on revenue in a specific period results from transactions in multiple prior periods 
the increase in net revenue from to reflected i a million  or  increase in our corporate business and ii a million  or  increase in our consumer business 
net revenue from our corporate business increased during compared to primarily due to i a million increase in revenue from our end point solutions  which includes increased revenue from our system security solutions and new revenue from data encryption products integrated from our safeboot acquisition  ii a million increase in revenue from our network security offerings and iii a million increase in our vulnerability and risk management offerings 
in  we experienced an increase in the sale of our hardware solutions  which resulted in higher upfront revenue recognition

the increase in service and support revenue in compared to was attributable to an increase in support and maintenance primarily due to amortization of previously deferred revenue from support arrangements and an increase in sales of support renewals 
in addition  revenue from consulting increased due to both our foundstone consulting services  which includes threat modeling  security assessments and education  and mcafee consulting services  which provides product design and deployment support 
although we expect our service and support revenue to continue to increase  our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on renewals of support arrangements as well as our ability to respond successfully to the pace of technological change and expand our customer base 
if our renewal rate or our pace of new customer acquisition slows  our net revenue and operating results would be adversely affected

our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including factors beyond our control  such as the current weakness in the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and into which we sell our products  and increased uncertainty in the financial  capital and credit markets 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our management plans to use our cash and cash equivalents for future operations  potential acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock on the open market 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances and cash that we generate over time from operations  along with amounts available for borrowing under the credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in  and was primarily the result of our net income of million  million and million  respectively  net of non cash related expenses 
during  our primary working capital source was increased deferred revenue which was attributable to growing sales of maintenance renewals from our expanding customer base and increased sales of subscription based offerings 
working capital uses of cash included increased accounts receivable primarily due to increased invoicing over collections at the end of the year  increased prepaid expenses and other assets  and decreased accrued taxes and other liabilities primarily due to a tax settlement payment of approximately million 
in addition  during  payments to our partners for distribution related agreements were higher than in during  primary working capital sources were increases in deferred revenue  accrued taxes and other liabilities and accounts payable 
the increase in deferred revenue in was due to increased sales of subscription and support contracts 
the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to the classification of certain equity awards to liability awards as a result of modifications and additional accruals for legal settlements 
primary working capital uses were increases in accounts receivable primarily attributable to increased invoicing over collections at the end of the year and increases in prepaid expenses  prepaid taxes and other assets primarily attributable to prepayments to our partners 
during  primary working capital sources were increases in deferred revenue and accrued taxes and other liabilities 
the increase in deferred revenue in was due to increased sales of subscription and support contracts 

table of contents the primary working capital use was an increase in prepaid expenses  prepaid taxes and other assets primarily related to prepayments of royalties 
our cash and marketable securities balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the united states 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  were held outside the united states 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
we incurred material expenses in and as a direct result of the investigation into our stock option grant practices and related accounting 
these costs primarily related to professional services for legal  accounting and tax guidance 
in addition  we incurred costs related to litigation  the informal investigation by the sec  the grand jury subpoena from the us attorney s office for the northern district of california and the preparation and review of our restated consolidated financial statements for we expect that we may be subject to certain fines and or penalties resulting from the findings of the investigation 
we cannot reasonably estimate the range of fines and or penalties  if any  that might be incurred as a result of the investigation 
we expect to pay for these obligations with available cash 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  borrowings under the credit facility and internally generated funds 
we expect to continue generating positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue or what the effect on our business might be from the competitive environment in which we operate 
in addition  we currently cannot predict the outcome of the litigation described in note investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in in  the primary source of cash from investing activities was million of net proceeds from sales or maturities of marketable securities  net of purchases 
the primary uses of cash in investing activities included three acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements 
our cash used for acquisitions increased to in compared to million in during  we paid million  net of cash acquired  to purchase secure computing  million  net of cash acquired  to purchase reconnex  and million  net of cash acquired  to purchase scanalert 
in  including the amount placed in escrow  we paid million  net of the million cash acquired  for the purchase of safeboot 
our cash used for purchases of property and equipment increased to million in compared to million in the million of property and equipment purchased during was primarily for upgrades of our existing systems and purchases of computers  equipment and software  and for leasehold improvements at various offices 
the million of property and equipment purchased during was primarily for upgrades of our existing systems and purchases of computers  equipment and software for ongoing projects  for leasehold improvements primarily related to our expanded research and development facility in beaverton  oregon  and for the purchase of a generator to back up servers and all corporate computer systems at our plano  texas facility 
in addition  during  we purchased patents for million 
net cash used in investing activities decreased slightly to million in from million in during  we paid million  net of cash acquired  for four acquisitions and purchased million of property and equipment 
in  the sec entered the final judgment for settlement related to our investigation into our accounting practices that commenced in march the million that we placed in escrow in for the sec settlement was released from escrow for payment to the sec and was reflected as cash provided by investing activities 

table of contents financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in during  we used million to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market  including commissions paid on these transactions 
we had no purchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in during and  we used million and million  respectively  to repurchase shares of our common stock in connection with our obligation to holders of rsus  rsas and psus to withhold the number of shares required to satisfy the holders tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of such shares 
these shares were not part of the publicly announced repurchase program 
the primary source of cash provided by financing activities is proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and espp 
in  we received proceeds of million compared to million in and million in from issuance of stock under such plans 
beginning in july  we suspended purchases under our espp and prohibited our employees from exercising stock options due to the announced investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and our inability to become current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
on december   we became current on our reporting obligations and our employees were able to exercise stock options for the first time in over months 
therefore  proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and espp were significantly lower in and as compared to net cash used in financing activities was million in this reflects cash used to repurchase our common stock in the open market  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and espp 
we had no repurchases of our common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter of pursuant to a stock repurchase program that has been authorized by our board of directors  we may repurchase up to an additional million of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions through july  depending upon market conditions  share price and other factors 
while we expect to continue to receive proceeds from our stock option plans and espp in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the type of equity awards grants to our employees  the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
contractual obligations a summary of our fixed contractual obligations and commitments at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases other commitments purchase obligations fin obligations  including interest and penalties total operating leases are for office space and office equipment 
the operating lease commitments above reflect contractual and reasonably assured rent escalations under the lease arrangements 
the most significant of our lease contractual obligations relate to the following four leases million for the santa clara  california facility lease  million for two st 
paul  minnesota facility leases  million for the slough  united kingdom facility lease 

table of contents other commitments are minimum contractual commitments including telecom contracts  software licensing  royalty and distribution related agreements 
purchase obligations consist of purchase orders to our contract manufacturers  which typically have delivery dates from four to six weeks from the purchase order date 
as of december   we had approximately million of tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  related to uncertain tax positions 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur other than the amount included in the table above 
in addition to the contractual obligations above and as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion or all of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements or special purpose entities 
credit facilities on december   we entered into a credit facility credit facility that provides for a million unsecured term loan and a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a million letter of credit sublimit 
the credit facility also contains an expansion option permitting us to arrange up to an aggregate of million in additional commitments from existing lenders and or new lenders 
the principal of  together with accrued interest on  the term loan is due on december  the revolving credit facility terminates on december   on which date all outstanding principal of  together with accrued interest on  any revolving loans will be due

at december   we had million of restricted cash deposited at one of our lenders 
this amount will be reduced to million when the term loan is repaid in full 
the deposit will be restricted until we have repaid the outstanding balance on the term loan and on the expiration of the revolving credit facility 
no balances were outstanding under the credit facility as of december   however  we borrowed million under the term loan portion of the credit facility on january  
table of contents in addition  we have a million euro credit facility with a bank  the euro credit facility 
the euro credit facility is available on an offering basis  meaning that transactions under the euro credit facility will be on such terms and conditions  including interest rate  maturity  representations  covenants and events of default  as mutually agreed between us and the bank at the time of each specific transaction 
the euro credit facility is intended to be used for short term credit requirements  with terms of one year or less 
the euro credit facility can be canceled at any time 
no balances were outstanding under the euro credit facility as of december  financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
foreign currency risk as a global concern  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our functional currency is typically the currency of the local country 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in europe  latin america and asia 
at the present time  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows or transact in foreign currencies for trading or other speculative purposes 
the success of this activity depends upon estimates of transaction activity denominated in various currencies  primarily the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar 
to the extent that these estimates are incorrect  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
to reduce exposures associated with certain nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities  we enter into forward contracts 
our foreign exchange contracts typically range from one to three months in original maturity 
the forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly are marked to market at the end of each reporting period with any unrealized gain or loss being recognized in the statement of income as interest and other income 
during and  net realized gains arising from the settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts were million and million  respectively 
net realized losses arising from the settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts were million in forward contracts outstanding at december  are presented below in thousands december  notional us dollar equivalent fair value euro british pound canadian dollar a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of december  indicated that a hypothetical and appreciation of the us dollar or currency being hedged from its value at december  would decrease the fair value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 
a and depreciation of the us dollar from its value at december  would increase the fair value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk we maintain balances in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
all financial instruments used are in accordance with our investment policy 
we maintain our investment securities in portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities including money market  government agency  mortgage backed  asset backed and investment grade corporate bonds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are 
table of contents recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
during  there were significant disruptions in the financial markets 
a number of large financial institutions failed  were supported by the us government or were merged into other organizations 
the market disruption has resulted in a lack of liquidity in the credit markets and a decline in the market value of debt securities 
as a result of these effects  during we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to marketable securities 
we had a net unrealized gain of million on marketable securities at december   compared with a net unrealized gain of million at december  of the million impairment  million related to corporate bonds and asset backed and mortgaged backed securities which suffered declines in fair value  million related to a single corporate bond that had a significant decline in fair value due to the issuer s bankruptcy and million related to impairment recorded because we no longer had the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient for the fair values to recover due to funding our acquisition of secure computing which was a one time event 
we had no impairment of marketable securities in and the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities held at december  that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps over a twelve month time horizon 
beginning fair values represent the market principal plus accrued interest and dividends at december  ending fair values are the market principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income over a twelve month time horizon
