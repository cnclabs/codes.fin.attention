the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of staar  including the related notes  provided in this report 
overview strategy during  staar is focused on the following five strategic operational goals to improve cash flow  to increase gross profit margin  to continue cost reduction efforts  to secure key regulatory approvals  to increase the icl s share of the refractive market in key territories 
improve cash flow 
for several years staar has not generated enough cash to sustain its operations and has relied on financing activity to supplement cash from operations 
through a combination of cost cutting and increased sales staar has reduced its use of cash significantly in recent periods and  if recent trends continue  staar expects to generate positive cash flow from operations within while staar s goal is to achieve to profitability and generate positive earnings per share  achievement of positive cash flow would be an important milestone for the company  would enhance its ability to obtain financing on favorable terms  and would permit the company to further invest in expansion of its business 
staar used million of cash in operations during fiscal year compared to million of cash used during approximately million of the total cash used in operating activities in was used by staar japan in assuming the iol distribution business acquired from canon marketing japan  inc and for payments on inventory purchased from canon marketing 
staar seeks to reduce its use of cash both by cutting costs and by increasing revenue and profit margin 
our strategy to increase profit margin is discussed in detail under increase profit margins below 
cost cutting has been an integral part of staar s efforts to increase its cash flow 
staar s cost cutting efforts in the us described in greater detail under the heading continue cost reduction efforts below  yielded savings of approximately million 
staar exited with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  compared with million at the end of fiscal year during fiscal year and early staar s cash flow has been significantly affected by the cost of defending two lawsuits brought by former regional manufacturer s representatives 
on march   a jury verdict in one of these cases was rendered against staar for a total of million in actual and punitive damages 
contesting this verdict  litigating the second case  and either satisfying any final judgment or securing a bond for appeal  will require significant additional cash and enhancement of staar s existing cash resources 
management is developing a strategy to meet this extraordinary short term need for cash  but at the same time is focusing on cash management  increased revenue and improved profit margins as the keys to its long term success and as the most important factor in attracting future investment 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
staar believes its cash management plans are achievable and continues to seek ways to reduce spending  however  staar cannot provide assurance that it will achieve the level of intended savings 
staar s cash management plans depend on the ultimate payment  if any  required under to the parallax judgment  increases in us sales of high margin icl and other refractive products as well as improvements in revenue generated by us sales of iol and other cataract products 
during  staar experienced an increase of in us sales of icl products over fiscal year however  although the rate of decline has slowed  us sales of iol products declined by over compared to a decrease when comparing fiscal year versus if new cataract product introductions by staar do not generate significant additional revenues  staar may be required to more significantly reduce spending in its us operations 
increase gross profit margins 
in recent periods staar has generally experienced increased sales in all products  except us iol sales 
us iol sales have been declining  but at a slower pace and  depending on the success of planned product introductions  may resume growth in while revenue growth remains a key goal  staar believes that the key to achieving profitability is to increase its profit margin by the following means increasing icl sales as a percentage of staar s overall product mix 
icls and ticls generally yield high margins and are staar s most profitable product 
icls continue to represent the fastest growing product line of staar s business and are the largest contributor to enhanced profit margins 
bringing icl and ticl to new markets  and expanding market share in existing markets  will improve staar s profitability 
this initiative is described in greater detail under other highlights icl sales below 
shifting to higher value iols 
in and staar began converting its us iol product offering from lower value legacy products to newer aspheric designs that are eligible for enhanced cms reimbursement as ntiols 
while staar hopes to regain lost us iol market share through new product introductions  the enhanced profitability of these designs should significantly improve the performance of the us iol business even if market share gains are minimal 
additionally  staar believes continued growth of its high margin preloaded iol offering can contribute significantly to improvement in staar s gross margins in improve product mix and pricing of other surgical products 
staar distributes a variety of complimentary products used in ophthalmic surgery as a service to its customers 
in an effort to improve margins of other surgical products  the company is reviewing all pricing to determine if products are priced appropriately and discontinuing product lines with lower than average margins 
implement centers of excellence program 
staar believes that it has an opportunity to reduce costs while continuing its history of innovation by rationalizing its business among its worldwide operations through its centers of excellence program 
the first initiative in this area will begin in  as staar begins making its us facility the center of excellence for optical design and manufacturing of iols and japan the center of excellence for design and manufacturing of delivery systems 
by moving all iol manufacturing to staar s monrovia facility staar expects to significantly reduce costs by increasing volume without significantly increasing fixed costs  and to supply iols to staar japan at a significant reduction to its current manufacturing cost 
similarly  the transfer of delivery system development and manufacturing to japan is expected to lead to cost savings and a greater focus on staar japan s more advanced lens injector designs 
continue cost reduction efforts 
while staar s international operations  outside of japan  have generally generated cash or been cash flow neutral in recent periods  losses from us operations have been the principal cause of cash use on a consolidated basis 
to reduce these losses  staar implemented cost cutting measures in the third fiscal quarter of and throughout  including targeted reductions in the us workforce 
beginning in december  staar began a process to closely rationalize and evaluate its spending levels 
this evaluation identified opportunities by which staar sought to save approximately million in annualized costs in the us these initiatives included streamlining staar s us organization by reducing spending levels in all areas of the business  renegotiating or eliminating certain obligations  and eliminating all executive bonus opportunities until staar showed positive trends toward achieving profitability 
during these reductions in the us totaled million  despite an approximate  increase in legal fees 
however  while staar has achieved these reductions in its us operations  the reductions have been offset  in part  by the need to increase expenses outside the us to support its international icl sales growth 
secure key regulatory approvals 
regulatory approvals of high margin products in significant markets can yield rapid growth in sales and improvements in profitability 
the principal approvals pursued by staar at this time are the us approval of the ticl and the approval of icl  ticl  collamer iols and aquaflow in japan 
staar s ticl corrects both myopia and astigmatism  and has been shown to be highly effective in treating individuals affected by both conditions 
when staar has introduced the ticl in international markets it has generally experienced rapid growth  and the ticl may also lead to increased icl sales by making the product family a more complete solution that physicians can offer to patients 
staar has applied for approval of the ticl in the us  but the fda has suspended review of the application pending resolution of concerns regarding staar s oversight of the ticl clinical study 
this agency action  and staar s progress in resolving it  is discussed below under the caption other highlights medical device regulatory compliance  clinical oversight and ticl approval 
based on experience in international markets  staar believes that us sales of the icl will increase even if ticl approval continues to be delayed 
nevertheless  staar believes that approval and introduction of the ticl would significantly enhance refractive sales in the us obtaining approval remains a part of staar s long term strategy 
approval of icl  ticl  collamer iols and aquaflow by japanese regulators is pending 
like other asian countries  japan has a high mean rate of myopia  which is often accompanied by astigmatism 
as a result staar believes that the japanese market for icl and ticl is promising 
staar japan s preloaded iol injectors have established a presence in the japanese cataract iol market that could also help establish a market for the collamer iol 
increase the icl s share of the refractive market in key territories 
while the icl and ticl are approved for sale in over countries  it has achieved significant sales and a significant share of the refractive surgical market in a select number of territories  including the following us korea  china  india  spain  germany  and latin america 
to date  the highest penetration rate achieved by staar for icl and ticl within the refractive surgery market has been 
staar believes it has the opportunity to achieve significant profits if it can achieve a or greater penetration rate in these key markets  and during will focus its international sales efforts on that goal 
other highlights us icl sales 
notwithstanding strong and sustained growth internationally  us market growth is considered essential because of the size of the us refractive surgery market and the perceived leadership of the us in adopting innovative medical technologies 
the visian icl was approved by the fda for treatment of myopia on december during fiscal year staar s us sales of visian icls increased compared to staar believes this represents a trend to resumed growth in us refractive sales following sales levels that did not grow beyond those reached in the first year of introduction 
staar believes that the following are among the factors that may have contributed to improved visian icl sales in increasing use of the icl by a number of surgeons among staar s established us customers as they have gained experience with the product and become more skilled at identifying  attracting and supporting those patients most likely to benefit from the icl  increased patient awareness of the icl as a result of favorable mass media exposure for the icl  a change in marketing focus as staar  in its third year of icl marketing in the us  has shifted from increasing its overall customer base to devoting more attention to identifying and supporting those surgical practices that show potential for significant repeat business through a professional commitment to the icl technology  and greater stability and focus in staar s refractive support team following its reorganization in the second half of to achieve its plans  staar will need not only to sustain  but to increase this rate of growth 
staar believes that such an increase is achievable because  among other things  the favorable media coverage for the icl and the implementation of staar s revised marketing approach had only begun to have their effect late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter 
for example  a segment of the nbc news today show featuring a successful live icl surgery  aired on march   and a segment featuring use of icl aired on the cbs early show august  those shows and similar local television news segments resulted in increased consumer interest in icl  as measured by web traffic and inquiries received on web sites maintained by staar and by the surgeons involved 
notwithstanding the increasing visian icl sales in  staar will continue to face challenges in marketing the icl in the us  including the following the us refractive surgery market has been dominated by corneal laser based techniques  which unlike the visian icl are already well known to potential refractive patients  other newly introduced surgical products will continue to compete with the visian icl for the attention of surgeons seeking to add new  high value surgical products  in particular multifocal and accommodating iols  the recession has reduced refractive surgical volumes and thereby reduced the number of patients to whom icl is offered  negative publicity about complications of lasik could reduce interest in all refractive surgical procedures  and fda approval of the ticl  which staar sells in international markets for treating patients severely affected by both myopia and astigmatism  has been delayed 
refractive surgery is an elective procedure generally not covered by health insurance 
patients must pay for the procedure  frequently through installment financing arrangements 
icl sales continued to grow during despite worsening conditions in the general economy 
however  staar believes that the recession has decreased the growth rate for us icl sales and likely contributed to a flat rate of growth in the fourth quarter of us icl may be further affected if the us recessions deepens or continues for a prolonged period 
on april   the fda ophthalmic devices panel held a public meeting to discuss issues of medical complications and customer satisfaction following refractive surgery 
while the panel also discussed phakic iols such as the visian icl  most of its discussions centered on lasik and testimony regarding customer dissatisfaction following lasik surgery 
the panel recommended enhanced patient warnings of possible complications for lasik and created a task force to study methods of better identifying those patients who are more likely to have an unsatisfactory outcome from laser vision correction 
the proceedings of the panel were widely reported in the us while it is difficult to assess precisely the impact of the panel hearings on patient attitudes or the recommendations of practicing surgeons  it is possible that reduced demand for laser eye surgery observed in was caused in part by concerns regarding complications and potential patient dissatisfaction 
patient concerns about lasik could increase interest in the visian icl as an alternative for patients who have a greater risk of complications from lasik 
the fact that the visian icl is removable if a patient is dissatisfied with the outcome may also be appealing to some patients with new concerns about risks of refractive surgery 
however  the negative publicity concerning lasik could decrease patient interest in all refractive surgery  including visian icl 
because nearly all candidates for refractive surgery can achieve acceptable vision through the use of spectacles or contact lenses  for most patients the decision to have refractive surgery is a lifestyle choice that depends on high confidence in achieving a satisfactory outcome 
staar makes the icl available to selected surgeons only after completion of a training program that includes proctoring of selected supervised surgeries 
staar believes that this carefully guided method of product release is essential to help ensure the consistent quality of patient outcomes and the high levels of patient satisfaction needed to establish wide acceptance of the icl as a primary choice for refractive surgery 
as staar enters its fourth year of icl marketing in the us  it is placing less emphasis on increasing its overall customer base and devoting more attention to identifying and supporting those practices that show potential for significant repeat business through a professional commitment to the icl technology 
staar will continue to provide training and proctoring to all qualified surgeons seeking certification in the icl 
because the refractive surgery market has been dominated by corneal laser based techniques  staar faces special challenges in introducing an intraocular refractive implant 
staar has developed a number of marketing tools and practice support programs to increase the use of the icl and awareness of its advantages in refractive surgery centers throughout the us and around the world 
us iol sales 
for several years staar has experienced a decline in us market share of iol 
us iol product sales declined during fiscal year compared with the and during compared with the same period of factors contributing to long term decline in us iol sales include the slow pace of product improvement and enhancement during a period when we devoted most of our research and development resources to introducing the icl and to resolving the regulatory and compliance issues raised by the fda 
this long term trend was intensified in by disruption in staar s independent sales force when staar was unable to reach a new contract with regional manufacturer s representatives  in the third quarter of in addition the trend was exacerbated by staar s lagging behind its competitors in the introduction of iols with advanced aspheric optics  and by the entry of alcon as a competitor in the toric iol market 
staar s strategy to achieve profitability in its us iol business is to rationalize its product offering around its higher value products  including recently introduced products and products planned for introduction in the near future 
this has included aspheric optics across all iol platforms  approval of higher reimbursement from medicare for these lenses  improved delivery systems for collamer iols to broaden their appeal and preloaded delivery systems for silicone lenses 
successful implementation of this strategy is subject to risks  including the risk of delays in developing new products or securing regulatory approval 
staar s initiatives to enhance its iol product line have resulted in the following recent developments the introduction of staar s aspheric three piece collamer iol in april the introduction of staar s aspheric three piece silicone iol november the april introduction of the nanopoint injector  which delivers staar s single piece collamer iol through a mm incision  the grant of new technology iol ntiol status for the aspheric three piece collamer iol in march   the grant of ntiol status for the aspheric single piece collamer iol and the aspheric three piece silicone iol in july  the addition of aspheric optics to staar s iol designs has been a primary focus of staar s recent development efforts 
aspheric iols use advanced optical designs intended to provide a clearer image than traditional spherical lenses  especially in low light  which has led to significant market share gains for aspheric designs 
in recognition of these advantages the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms will grant ntiol status to aspheric iols that can demonstrate improved visual performance over conventional iols  allowing an extra reimbursement per lens implanted in an asc ambulatory surgical center 
because the majority of iol purchases in the us are implanted at ascs and reimbursed through medicare  ntiol status significantly increases staar s potential margin on qualifying lenses 
all of staar s aspheric lenses sold in the us feature a proprietary optical design patent pending that is optimized for the naturally curved surface of the retina and certain other anatomical features of the human eye  and provides outstanding image quality even if decentered 
staar intends to continue to focus on the following projects designed to make our iol product offering more competitive developing a collamer toric iol to complement our pioneering silicone toric iol and better compete with the alcon acrylic toric iol  introduction of an aspheric single piece collamer iol  which brings advanced aspheric optics to the micro incision nanopoint platform  introduction of an all new injector system for the three piece collamer iol  and adapting our proprietary preloaded injector system for our new silicone aspheric iols 
staar cautions that the successful development and introduction of new products is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risk of unexpected delays 
staar s development efforts aim to realize the full market potential for collamer iols by improving lens delivery systems and differentiating staar s silicone iol offering through the preloaded injector 
the majority of iols sold by staar in the us are made of silicone  which was the original material used for foldable iols 
however  physician preferences in the us have strongly shifted to acrylic iols which currently account for an approximately share of the us iol market 
staar believes that its collamer lenses have outstanding optical qualities and superior biocompatibility  and should be capable of competing with any of our competitor s acrylic lens products in the advanced material sector 
in addition  increasing use of the icl  which relies on the outstanding optical properties of collamer  has also introduced the advantages of the collamer material to a growing number of surgeons 
however  growth of the collamer iol market has been limited by the difficulty of perfecting delivery systems for the soft collamer material 
although acrylic lenses do not have the same level of optical performance in the eye as collamer and often introduce glare or glistening into the visual field  the stiffness and toughness of the acrylic material makes design of delivery systems simpler 
staar has a number of development projects in place intended to make collamer lenses easier to deliver and broaden customer appeal 
the nanopoint injector system  which delivers the one piece collamer iol through a mm incision  was the first of these projects to reach market and was launched in april while the us market share for silicone iols has been slowly declining overall  a significant number of surgeons continue to select silicone lenses for their patients 
staar believes that its recently introduced aspheric  three piece silicone iol offers outstanding optical performance and with its recently granted ntiol status could enable staar to retain or possibly increase its market share within the silicone iol sector  especially if staar s efforts are successful in securing fda approval to make it available in a preloaded injector 
we have developed and currently market the toric iol  a toric version of our single piece silicone iol  which is specifically designed for cataract patients who also have pre existing astigmatism 
until only staar sold toric iols in the us because cms allows cataract patients receiving reimbursement to pay a premium for the correction of pre existing astigmatism  while medicare provides the customary reimbursement for cataract surgery  toric iols can be sold at a higher price and higher profit margin than standard iols 
cms also permits the patient to separately remunerate the surgeon for the significant additional services needed to prescribe and implant a lens with toric correction for astigmatism 
the increased revenues and profit margin originally expected by staar as a result of the cms ruling have  to date  not been realized because of the introduction of a competing acrylic toric iol by alcon laboratories 
in particular  staar believes that in a number of customers who previously had purchased staar s toric iol but had otherwise been customers of alcon s ophthalmic products  converted to use of the alcon toric iol 
reversing the decline in us iol sales will require staar to overcome several short and long term challenges  including successfully meeting its objectives to develop new and enhanced products  organizing  training and managing a specialized cataract sales force  managing independent local sales representatives  competing with much larger companies and overcoming reputational harm from the fda s findings of compliance deficiencies 
we cannot assure that this strategy will ultimately be successful 
reorganization of us sales force 
staar comprehensively reorganized its us sales force in the latter part of and early staar now directly employs its regional sales managers 
at the local level staar continues to rely on independent sales representatives as well as employees to promote sales and demonstrate products 
staar believes that its reorganized sales force will position the company to capitalize on enhancements to its cataract product line intended to make the line more competitive 
medical device regulatory compliance  clinical oversight and ticl approval 
as discussed above under the caption business regulatory matters  staar s ability to develop  manufacture and distribute its products depends heavily on maintaining good standing with the fda and other regulatory agencies 
based on the results of the fda inspections of staar s monrovia  california facilities in and  staar believes that it is substantially in compliance with the fda s quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations 
staar has invested significant resources in maintaining regulatory compliance and expects to continue to do so in the future 
notwithstanding its success in overcoming past concerns regarding its quality systems  staar believes that it has not yet fully overcome the reputational harm caused by the fda s past findings of compliance deficiencies  which may continue to present a challenge in increasing us product sales 
in the opinion of staar s management  the june  warning letter from the bioresearch monitoring program of the fda office of regulatory affairs bimo and the integrity hold placed on staar s clinical activities by the office of device evaluation  although they concern staar s oversight of clinical activities rather than its quality systems  have perpetuated the reputational harm resulting from the earlier fda actions  and have made it more difficult for staar to regain its former market share 
staar believes that us approval of the ticl  if granted  and continued evidence of good standing with the fda will reduce and may eventually eliminate the reputational harm caused by past agency actions 
financing strategy while staar s international business generates of staar s revenue  staar has reported losses on a consolidated basis over the last several years due to a number of factors  including eroding sales of cataract products in the us and fda compliance issues that consumed additional resources while delaying the introduction of new products in the us market 
in may staar raised net proceeds of million from the public offering and sale of common stock  the proceeds of which were used to pay off the march million broadwood note and for general working capital purposes 
on december   staar also borrowed million from broadwood partners  lp  at an interest rate of per annum  primarily to fund the acquisition of staar s remaining interest in the canon staar joint venture 
staar s management believes that its best prospect for achieving profitability in its us and consolidated operations is to significantly increase us sales of the icl and to reduce operating expenses 
in the longer term staar seeks to develop and introduce products in the us cataract market to stop further erosion of its market share and resume growth in that sector 
the final judgment expected to result from the million parallax verdict  and the cost and exposure to a negative outcome in subsequent litigation  will exceed staar s current capital resources 
accordingly  staar expects to seek additional equity or debt financing  to divest itself of non strategic assets  or pursue some combination of the foregoing to meet its need for working capital in staar may also seek new capital to expand its business or fund efforts to improve efficiency 
however  staar does not expect to require significant new working capital to support operations if its initiatives for cash management and improved profitability continue in line with present trends 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the period indicated and the percentage increase or decrease in such items over the prior period 
percentage of net sales percentage change january  december  december  vs

sales of other surgical products  generally used during cataract surgery  increased 
us net sales for fiscal decreased to  compared with fiscal  due to a decrease in iol sales which was largely offset by a increase in icl sales and a increase in other product sales 
although iol sales declined for the full year  the year over year rate of decline has slowed from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of international net sales for fiscal were  an increase of compared with fiscal international iol sales were  up  compared with  in the significant increase in iol sales is due to the acquisition of staar japan at the beginning of  partially offset by a decrease in iol sales in international markets outside of japan 
during  international sales of icls increased to  compared with  in fiscal and other surgical product sales increased to  compared with  in fiscal gross profit margin gross profit margin for the fiscal was compared with for fiscal the increase in gross profit margin is due to sales of preloaded iols in japan which yield higher average selling prices than in other countries  increased sales of icls  particularly in the us where prices are higher  and increased sales of ticls 
the improvement in gross profit margin was partially offset by the staar japan acquired inventory  which was recorded at fair value in accordance with purchase accounting rules 
this higher valued inventory was sold during resulting in million in additional cost of goods sold 
the company expects gross profit margin to increase as sales of icls globally and preloaded iols in japan become a larger percentage of overall revenue mix and sales of aspheric iols replace sales of non aspheric iols in the us general and administrative general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  representing a increase over the  reported in fiscal  entirely due to  incurred by staar japan  offset by  reduction in the rest of the company despite significant legal costs associated with the sales representative litigation 
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses for fiscal were  representing a increase over the  reported in fiscal the increase in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal was due to the  in costs associated with staar japan 
marketing and selling expenses in the us decreased  and this decrease was partially offset by a  increase in international expenses outside of japan and the us to support the increase in icl sales 
research and development research and development expenses  including regulatory and clinical expenses  for fiscal were  representing an increase over the  reported in fiscal the increase is due to the  in costs associated with staar japan  offset by a decrease of  as a result of cost reduction measures taken in the us to improve cash flows 
the company expects to spend approximately of revenues in fiscal on its research and development activities 
other operating expenses other operating expenses for fiscal were  and consisted of the following loss on settlement of pre existing distribution arrangement in the amount of  the loss was recorded in connection with the company s acquisition of staar japan and represented the portion of the consideration paid by staar for the termination of the pre existing distribution arrangement that was deemed unfavorable to staar japan and to staar when compared to an at market arrangement as of the closing date of the acquisition  patent impairment charges in the amount of  this non cash expense was recorded in connection with certain patents that were determined to have minimal fair value to the company pursuant to the annual impairment review  and jury verdict in favor of parallax medical systems  inc reached subsequent to year end in the amount of  see item legal proceedings 
income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of  and  for fiscal and respectively 
the increase in the provision of  was primarily due to increases in the company s current foreign tax provision of  due to pre tax profits generated by staar surgical ag  offset by a decrease in the foreign deferred tax provision of  fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales for the year ended december  fiscal were  an increase of compared with net sales for the year ended december  fiscal of  changes in currency exchange rates had a million impact on net sales for fiscal us net sales for fiscal decreased to  compared with fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in iol sales and a decrease in other product sales mainly related to other refractive products 
the decline in cataract product sales is due  in part  to a shift in market preference from spherical iols to aspheric iols 
the company introduced its first aspheric iol made of collamer during the second quarter of which should allow the company to compete more effectively in this market segment 
the decrease in other refractive product sales is due primarily to decreased sales of instruments used in icl surgery 
sales of icls were essentially flat year over year in the us international net sales for fiscal were  an increase of compared with fiscal during  international icl and ticl sales increased to  compared with  in fiscal and a increase in other product sales mainly related to cataract surgeries 
in fiscal  international cataract related sales were negatively impacted by doctor strikes in germany  one of staar s largest cataract sales markets 
these labor disputes were subsequently settled in the same year 
sales of iol were essentially flat year over year internationally 
during fiscal  global sales of icls and ticls grew to  compared with  in fiscal gross profit margin gross profit margin for fiscal was compared with for fiscal the increase in gross profit margin is due to reduction in inventory reserves  higher average selling prices of certain iols and ticls  increased volume sales of higher margin icls and ticls and improved overall iol costs partially offset by an increase in manufacturing engineering costs 
the gross profit for fiscal was impacted by obsolescence charges of  for certain iol inventory in anticipation of new product launches in and to a lesser degree slower moving diopters of other lenses 
this charge reduced s gross profit margin by approximately 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased or  over fiscal the increase was primarily due to costs associated with the domilens investigation of approximately  increased legal expenses of  increased compensation expense associated with executive relocation and other general cost increases 
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses for fiscal increased or  compared with fiscal the increase in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal primarily resulted from increased international costs to support the increase in international sales and increased domestic costs from increased salaries  travel and consulting fees partially offset by decreased commissions 
research and development research and development expenses  including regulatory and clinical expenses  for fiscal decreased or  compared with fiscal the decrease is due to decreased legal fees and costs associated with new product development 
other expense income  net other expense  net for fiscal was  compared to net other income of  for fiscal the increase in other expenses is due to decreased earnings from joint venture  increased interest expense from financing arrangements  increased foreign exchange losses  write off of deferred financing costs and losses from the extinguishment of the march million broadwood note  partially offset by a fair value adjustment upon revaluation of the march broadwood warrant obligation at december  income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  for fiscal and  for fiscal during fiscal  the company reached a settlement with the german ministry of finance related to taxes assessed in connection with unreported sales of a company controlled by the former president of domilens  gmbh 
as a result of the settlement  the company reversed approximately  in income tax expense originally recorded in the fourth quarter of  based on the best information available to management at that time 
liquidity and capital resources going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business 
for several years staar has incurred significant losses  has not generated sufficient cash to sustain its operations  and has relied on financing activity to supplement cash from operations 
as of january   staar had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
staar s likely cash requirements rose considerably on march   when an adverse verdict against staar in parallax medical systems  inc parallax v 
staar surgical company  a case originally filed on september   resulted in an award against staar of approximately million in actual damages and million in punitive damages 
the million judgment appears as other expenses in total selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january  and in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of the year then ended 
the parallax verdict  along with staar s history of recurring losses  negative cash flows and limited access to capital  has raised substantial doubt regarding staar s ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
staar believes that the parallax case was incorrectly decided as to liability  the amount of compensatory damages and the appropriateness and amount of punitive damages 
as part of its strategy to resolve doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern  staar intends to vigorously contest the outcome of the parallax case through post trial proceedings and  if necessary  appeal  in an effort to reduce the amount of the judgment against staar 
staar also seeks to overcome this substantial doubt concerning its ability to continue as going concern by continuing to pursue its strategic operating goals for enhanced profitability and by obtaining new debt and or equity financing 
staar s strategic operating goals include the following improve cash flow and continue cost reduction efforts 
in the latter part of and throughout  staar implemented cost cutting measures and began a process to closely rationalize and evaluate its spending levels  which included a targeted reduction in the us workforce  streamlining the us organization by reducing spending levels in all areas of the business  renegotiating or eliminating certain obligations  and eliminating all executive bonus opportunities until staar showed positive trends toward achieving profitability 
through these efforts staar has significantly reduced its cash used in operating activities in as compared to and  if recent operating trends continue  staar expects to generate positive cash flows within  increase gross profit margins 
in recent periods staar has experienced increased sales in all products  except us iol sales 
staar believes that the key to achieving profitability is to increase profit margins  primarily by increasing icl sales as a percentage of staar s overall product mix 
icls and ticls generally yield higher margins and continue to represent the fastest growing product line of staar s business 
while the icl and ticl are approved for sale in over countries  staar has achieved a significant sales and market share of the refractive surgical market in a number of select countries  including in the us  south korea  china  india  spain  germany and latin america 
bringing icl and ticl to new markets  and expanding market share in existing markets  will improve staar s profitability and during staar will focus its sales efforts on this goal  secure key regulatory approvals 
regulatory approval of higher margin products in significant markets can yield rapid sales growth and improve profitability 
the principal regulatory approvals pursued by staar at this time are the us approval of the ticl and the approval of icl and ticl in japan 
although the timing of regulatory approval is never certain  the company believes approval of these products could be granted in in addition  staar s ability to overcome this substantial doubt concerning its ability to continue as a going concern depends on several factors involving certain current litigation matters 
the parallax court has stayed the execution of judgment and collection of damages until after the completion of post trial motions and the deadline to file notice of appeal  which is a period of approximately three months 
if staar is unable to obtain additional capital to satisfy the judgment or post an appeal bond before the expiration of the stay  staar could be required to petition for protection under federal bankruptcy laws  which could further impair its financial position and liquidity  and would likely result in a default of its other debt obligations 
in addition  another lawsuit similar to the parallax case  moody v 
staar surgical company  is currently scheduled for trial in the superior court of california  county of orange  on may  and could result in further significant liability 
as of the date of this report  staar believes that the differences in the moody case present uncertainties such that the outcome is neither probable nor remote and therefore  staar cannot estimate the amount or range of loss  if any  in the event of an unfavorable outcome 
the substantial doubt about staar s ability to continue as a going concern could also affect staar s relationship with its trade suppliers and their willingness to continue to conduct business with staar on terms consistent with historical practice 
these suppliers might respond to an apparent weakening of our liquidity position and to address their own liquidity needs may request faster payment of invoices  new or increased deposits or other assurances 
if this were to happen  the company s need for cash would be intensified and we might be unable to make payments to our suppliers as they become due 
among the events of default in the senior promissory note the note held by broadwood partners  lp is any judgment in excess of  against the company that shall remain unpaid 
because staar is not required to pay the parallax judgment until the expiration of the stay days after final judgment  and because the amount to be paid pursuant to the judgment will not be fixed until final judgment is rendered on or before may   staar believes that as of the date of this report the parallax judgment should not be deemed unpaid and that an event of default under the senior promissory note would not have occurred 
to avoid dispute over this matter and to secure the lender s temporary waiver of remedies for an event of default during the stay of the parallax judgment  staar and broadwood entered into a temporary waiver agreement on april  if the company is unable to successfully appeal the judgment and or is required to pay the amount as awarded by the jury or some other amount and is unable to pay  this could also constitute an event of default of the existing outstanding debt  thereby potentially requiring the company to seek relief under the us bankruptcy code

on december   the company borrowed million from broadwood partners  lp broadwood pursuant to a senior promissory note the note between the company and broadwood 
the borrowed funds were used to finance the cash consideration and related transaction costs in the company s purchase of the remaining interests in its canon staar co  inc joint venture 
the note has a term of three years and bears interest at a rate of per annum 
under the note a default  if not waived  would result in an escalation of the interest rate to a maximum of per annum 
the note is not secured by any collateral  may be pre paid by the company at any time without penalty  and is not subject to covenants based on financial performance or financial condition except for insolvency 
the note provides that  with certain exceptions  the company will not incur indebtedness senior to or at parity with its indebtedness under the note without the consent of broadwood 
on march   a verdict was rendered in the case of parallax medical systems  inc v 
staar surgical company whereby a jury awarded parallax approximately million  comprising of million in actual damages and million in punitive damages 
among the events of default in the senior promissory note the note held by broadwood partners  lp is any judgment in excess of  against the company that shall remain unpaid 
because staar is not required to pay the parallax judgment until the expiration of the stay days after final judgment  and because the amount to be paid pursuant to the judgment will not be fixed until final judgment is rendered on or before may   staar believes that as of the date of this report the parallax judgment should not be deemed unpaid and that an event of default under the senior promissory note would not have occurred 
to avoid dispute over this matter and to secure the lender s temporary waiver of remedies for an event of default during the stay of the parallax judgment  staar and broadwood entered into a temporary waiver agreement on april  the temporary waiver agreement provides that any event of default under the note that occurs or may be deemed to have occurred as a result of the parallax judgment will be waived for the shorter of the duration of the stay period and july  at the expiration of the stay  if the parallax judgment has been satisfied any such default will be cured and the interest rate will go back to 
if the parallax judgment is not satisfied  but staar secures an additional stay pending appeal  any such default will be deemed partially cured and the note will not be subject to acceleration  however  interest under the note will rise to the default rate of a maximum  an increase of  per year in interest expense unless and until the parallax judgment is satisfied and any other pending and undecided material litigation is resolved 
as consideration for temporary waiver agreement  staar will amend the note to grant to broadwood a security interest in all of staar s assets to secure staar s obligations under the senior note 
the foregoing summary of the temporary waiver agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of that agreement  a copy of which is attached to this report as exhibit 
as additional consideration for the loan the company also entered into a warrant agreement the warrant agreement with broadwood granting the right to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  exercisable for a period of six years 
the note also provides that if the company has any indebtedness outstanding on the note on june   it will issue additional warrants on the same terms as set forth in the warrant agreement in a number equal to  times the percentage of the original million principal that remains outstanding 
the note also gives broadwood the right to participate on a pro rata basis in certain offerings of equity securities until the note is no longer outstanding 
based on representations made by broadwood in the promissory note  on the date of the transaction  broadwood beneficially owned  shares of the company s common stock  comprising of the company s common stock as of december  based on publicly available information filed by broadwood  neal bradsher  president of broadwood partners  lp  may have been deemed to beneficially own all of the  shares 
broadwood also holds a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  which warrant was issued in connection with a loan of million by broadwood under a promissory note dated march  the march  promissory note was repaid in full on june  the company s lease agreement with farnam street financial  inc  as amended on october   provides for purchases of up to  of property  plant and equipment 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas accounting for leases  purchases under this facility are accounted for as capital leases and have a three year term 
under the agreement  the company has the option to purchase any item of the leased property  at the end of the respective items lease terms  at a mutually agreed fair value 
on april   the company signed an additional leasing schedule with farnam  which provides for additional fixed assets purchases of  the terms of this new schedule conform to the amended agreement dated october  approximately  in borrowings were available under this facility as of january the company s lease agreement with mazuma capital corporation  as amended on august   provided for purchases of up to  of property  plant and equipment

the credit agreement may be terminated by the lender in accordance with its general terms and conditions 
the credit facility is not secured 
there were no borrowings outstanding as of january  and december  and the full amount of the line was available for borrowing as of january  the company s japanese subsidiary  staar japan  has an agreement with mizuho bank providing borrowings of up to  japanese yen approximately million based on the rate of exchange on january   at an interest rate equal to the tokyo short term prime interest rate approximately fixed as of january  and terminates on april   but may be renewed annually 
the credit facility is not collateralized 
as of january  the company had  japanese yen outstanding on the line of credit approximately million based on the rate of exchange on january  
the lines of credit available to our subsidiaries are subject to various covenants  and we risk defaulting on the terms of our lines of credit 
our limited borrowing capacity could cause a shortfall in working capital or prevent us from making expenditures to expand or enhance our business 
although we were compliant with our line of credit covenants as of january   a default on any of our lines of credit could cause an immediate termination and jeopardize our ability to continue operations

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and sales return  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based on historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these if actual conditions differ from our assumptions 
we believe the following represent its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned  which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab 
the company records revenue from non consignment product sales when title and risk of ownership has been transferred  which is typically at shipping point  except for our staar japan subsidiary  which is typically at delivery to the customer  in which staar japan will defer the revenue until the product is delivered to the customer 
staar japan does not have significant deferred revenues as delivery to the customer is generally made within the same or the next date of shipment 
our products are marketed to ophthalmic surgeons  hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers or vision centers  and distributors 
iols may be offered to surgeons and hospitals on a consignment basis 
we maintain title and risk of loss of consigned inventory 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize revenue for consignment inventory when the iol is implanted during surgery and not upon shipment to the surgeon 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate 
icls are sold only to certified surgeons who have completed requisite training 
we ship icls only for use by surgeons who have already been certified  or for use in scheduled training surgeries 
for all sales  we are the principal in the transaction in accordance with sab and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent as we  among other factors  bear general inventory risk  credit risk  have latitude in establishing the sales price and bear authorized sales returns inventory risk and therefore  sales are recognized gross with corresponding cost of sales 
cost of sales includes cost of production  freight and distribution  royalties  and inventory provisions  net of any purchase discounts 
we present sales tax we collect from our customers on a net basis excluded from our revenues  a presentation which is prescribed as one of two methods available under eitf issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
we generally permit returns of product if the product is returned within the time allowed by under our return policies  and in good condition 
we provide allowances for sales returns based on an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
while such allowances have historically been within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such returns requires consideration of  among other factors  historical returns experience and trends  including the need to adjust for current conditions and product lines  the entry of a competitor  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data 
we consider all available information in our quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
sales are reported net of estimated returns 
if the actual sales returns and allowances are greater than estimated by management  additional expense may be incurred 
we maintain provisions for uncollectible accounts based on estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
we consider all available information in our assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
stock based compensation 
we account for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors in accordance with sfas no 
r and the issuance of stock options and warrants for services from non employees in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  by estimating the fair value of options and warrants issued using the black scholes pricing model 
this model s calculations include the exercise price  the market price of shares on grant date  risk free interest rates  expected term of the option or warrant  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividend yield 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements for share based expense could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
accounting for warrants 
we account for the issuance of company derivative equity instruments such as the warrants  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf 
we agreed to use its best efforts to register and maintain registration of the common shares underlying certain warrants the warrant shares that were issued by us with debt instruments  so that the warrant holder may freely sell the warrant shares if the warrant is exercised  and we agreed that in any event we would secure effective registration within a certain time period after issuance typically up to five months from issuance 
in addition  while the relevant warrant agreement does not require cash settlement if we do not maintain continuous registration of certain warrant shares  the agreement does not specifically preclude cash settlement 
as a result eitf requires us to assume that in the absence of continuous effective registration we may be required to settle some of these warrants for cash when they are exercised 
accordingly  our agreement to register and maintain registration of certain warrant shares without express terms for settlement in the absence of continuous effective registration is presumed to create a liability to settle these warrants in cash  requiring liability classification 
we have issued other warrants under another agreement that expressly provides that if we fail to satisfy registration requirements we will be obligated only to issue additional common stock as the holder s sole remedy  with no possibility of settlement in cash 
in this circumstance  we account for those warrants as equity because additional shares are the only form of settlement available to the holder 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as the valuation model to estimate the fair value of those warrants 
we evaluate the balance sheet classification of the warrants during each reporting period 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of the warrant is determined by the amount of time remaining on the original six year term of the relevant warrant agreement 
the risk free rate of return for periods within the contractual life of the warrant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at each reporting period 
any gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of the warrants classified as a liability from period to period are included as an increase or decrease of other income expense 
the warrants that are accounted for as equity are only valued on the issuance date and not subsequently revalued 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of january   the valuation allowance fully offsets the value of deferred tax assets on the company s balance sheet 
net increases to the valuation allowance were   and  in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until  and if  an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
in the normal course of business  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted if we prevailed in matters for which reserves have been established  or were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
inventories 
we provide estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable market values 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the expiration of products with a shelf life of less than four months  estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
several factors may influence the realizability of our inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
if in the future  we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if we determine that our inventory was undervalued  cost of sales in previous periods could have been overstated and we would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
while such inventory losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  including the impact of planned future product launches  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in reviewing for impairment  we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
our policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an assessment was completed under the guidance of sfas no 
for the year ended january   and based on that assessment we determined that certain of our patents had diminished in value or utility due to our discontinuance of certain products or procedures underlying the patents  and therefore  we recorded an impairment loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended discussed under definite lived intangible assets below 
goodwill 
goodwill  which has an indefinite life  is not amortized  but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios  including the use of experts 
our policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual impairment test using the methodology prescribed by sfas no 
and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
as of january   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
definite lived intangible assets 
we also have other intangible assets mainly consisting of patents and licenses  developed technologies and customer relationships  with a gross book value of million and accumulated amortization of million as of january  we capitalize the cost of acquiring patents and licenses 
we acquired certain customer relationships and developed technologies in the acquisition of our staar japan subsidiary which was completed on december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  since the pattern in which the economic benefits realized cannot be reasonably determined  which are based on legal  contractual and other provisions  and range from to years for patents and licenses  years for customer relationships and to years for developed technology 
we review intangible assets for impairment in the assessment discussed above regarding impairment of long lived assets 
based on this assessment we determined that certain of our patents had diminished in value or utility due to our discontinuance of certain products or procedures underlying the patents  and therefore  we recorded a million impairment loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended included in other expenses under selling  general and administrative expenses 
employee defined benefit plans 
we have historically maintained a passive pension plan the swiss plan covering employees of its swiss subsidiary 
this plan was previously classified and accounted for as a defined contribution plan 
based on new guidance obtained in the fourth quarter of fiscal from the swiss auditing chamber s auditing practice committee and its accounting practice committee with respect to a change in swiss pension law  the company concluded that the features of the swiss plan now conform to the features of a defined benefit plan 
as a result  we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of sfas nos 
  and r sfas on october  the effect of this adoption increased total liabilities by  net of tax  with a corresponding decrease to stockholder s equity 
see note in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in staar japan  inc  we assumed the net pension liability under staar japan s noncontributory defined benefit pension plan substantially covering all of the employees of staar japan 
staar japan adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of sfas no 
on december   the date of the acquisition 
sfas no 
requires recognition of the funded status  or difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the pension plan on the statement of financial position as of january  and december   with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income 
if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets  then that difference or unfunded status represents the pension liability 
we record a net periodic pension cost in the consolidated statement of operations 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of both plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  and the expected long term rate of asset return based on the market related value of assets 
the fair values of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements pertaining to our employee defined benefit plans could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas as amended fsp 
this fsp delays the effective date of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the delay is intended to allow the fasb and reporting entities additional time to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen  or that may arise  from the application of sfas no 
as such  the company partially adopted sfas on december  for the measurement of the plan assets fair value and disclosures relevant to our defined benefit plans which we have made pursuant to sfas no 
redeemable  convertible preferred stock under our certificate of incorporation we had  shares of blank check preferred stock  which our board of directors is authorized to issue with such rights  preferences and privileges as the board may determine 
on october   our board approved the designation of  shares of the preferred stock as series a redeemable convertible preferred stock preferred stock to be issued in connection with the acquisition of the interest in canon staar co  inc which was consummated on december  on december   we issued the  shares of preferred stock to the canon companies as partial consideration for their shares of canon staar co  inc at an estimated fair value of per share  or million in the aggregate 
the fair value of the preferred stock was determined on the issuance date by us with the assistance of a valuation specialist using the binomial tree option valuation model 
this model considers the preferred stock to be a derivative asset of our common stock where the preferred stockholder has options to choose certain payoffs that maximize returns and therefore maximize the value of the preferred stock 
the payoff available to the preferred stockholder is contingent on the future market value of our common stock 
therefore the model  based on certain significant management assumptions  analyzes various payoff patterns for different possible paths that might be followed by the common stock price over the life of the preferred stock until the automatic conversion on the fifth anniversary of the issuance date 
the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for our preferred stock could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
because after the third anniversary of issuance the preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the holders  which is not within our control  we have presented the preferred stock in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the provisions of eitf abstracts  topic no 
d topic d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
because the preferred stock fair value recorded on the issuance date approximates the redemption price  no further significant accretion will be required by us to redemption value and no subsequent revaluation will be necessary so long as the preferred stock is still considered a temporary equity instrument 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years had adversely affected our ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which could significantly affect our operating results 
we do not engage in hedging transactions to offset changes in currency or fluctuations in foreign currencies 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the past three years 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   fasb staff position fsp no 
r was issued and amends sfas no 
r  employer s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  to provide guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension dbp or other postretirement plan 
this fsp also includes certain requirements for non public companies disclosures about net periodic pension cost 
the fasb broadened the scope of this fsp to require employers to disclose information about fair value of measurements of plan assets that would be similar to the disclosures about fair value measurements required by sfas no 
the fsp was in response to concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding the types of assets and associated risks in an employer s defined benefit plan and events in the economy and markets that could have a significant effect on the value of plan assets 
this fsp applies to an employer that is subject to the disclosures requirements of sfas r

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages its risks based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
management does not believe that these market risks are material to the results of operations or cash flows of the company  and  accordingly  does not generally enter into interest rate or foreign exchange rate hedge instruments 
interest rate risk 
as of january   staar had million of foreign debt 
our million of foreign debt bears an interest rate that is equal to the tokyo prime interest rate and thus  our interest expense would fluctuate with any change in the prime interest rate 
if the tokyo prime rate were to increase or decrease by for the year  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately  japanese yen or approximately  based on the exchange rate in effect at january  staar s million principal amount of us indebtedness under the broadwood note bears a fixed interest rate of and may be prepaid without penalty 
under the note a default  if not waived  would result in an escalation of the stated interest rate to a maximum of 
if the stated interest rate were to increase to  our interest payments would increase by approximately  per year 
foreign currency risk 
our international subsidiaries operate in and are net recipients of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide primarily  the euro  japanese yen  swiss franc and australian dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and particularly the strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks include those set forth in item a 
risk factors
