item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
refer to forward looking statements following the index and item a risk factors of this form k 
overview our business we develop  manufacture and sell a complete line of reagents and automated systems used primarily by hospitals  clinical laboratories and donor centers in tests performed to detect and identify certain properties of human blood for the purpose of blood transfusion 
we have manufacturing facilities in the united states us and canada and sell our products through our direct sales network in the us  canada  western europe and japan as well as through third party distributors in other markets 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to continuing compliance with multiple country specific statutes  regulations and standards 
for example  in the us the food and drug administration fda regulates all aspects of the blood banking industry  including the marketing of reagents and instruments used to detect and identify blood properties 
in the markets of western europe  the testing of donor and patient blood for the purpose of transfusion is primarily automated 
however  in the us  we estimate approximately of blood banks perform this testing manually today 
these blood banks are primarily in the small to medium sized hospital segment 
our strategy is to drive automation in the blood bank with the goal of improving the blood bank s operations as well as patient safety 
we have introduced several instruments in the past  and we continue to focus on developing new instruments and improving our existing instruments 
we received fda clearance in june to market our galileo echo echo instrument 
the echo is a compact bench top  fully automated walk away instrument that meets the needs of the small to medium sized hospital market as well as integrated delivery networks that want to standardize the operations of their blood banks 
like our high volume galileo instrument  echo uses capture technology  our proprietary reagents  and offers an extensive test menu and significant labor reduction while increasing productivity and patient safety 
in fiscal  we entered the field of molecular immunohematology with our purchase of bioarray solutions 
bioarray acquisition on august   we acquired bioarray solutions ltd 
bioarray  a privately held company based in warren  new jersey for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash  including approximately million of acquisition related transaction costs 
we have included the financial results of bioarray in our consolidated financial statements beginning august  bioarray will continue to be based in warren and operate under the bioarray name 
the transaction costs included a payment of million to tm capital corp  an investment bank which has represented the company in a number of financial transactions  including the bioarray acquisition 
michael s 
goldman  one the company s former directors  is a managing director and founding principal of tm capital corp 
with the receipt of these fees  as of august   mr 
goldman no longer qualified as an independent director of the company under nasdaq stock market listing standards 
as a result  mr 
goldman resigned his positions as a member of the compensation committee and governance committee of the board of directors as of august  and did not stand for re election at the annual meeting of shareholders 
bioarray pioneered the development of molecular diagnostic systems that enable the dna typing genotyping of blood for transfusion donors and recipients 
in this transaction  we acquired the broad intellectual 
table of contents 
index to financial statements property portfolio bioarray generated through its substantial investments in research and development  including approximately issued or pending patents 
through the development of technologies supported by the patents  bioarray developed a novel and flexible technology platform that allows for a variety of dna based testing 
the platform combines semiconductor technology  microparticle chemistry and molecular biology to bring a high degree of flexibility and performance to qualitative and quantitative dna and protein analysis 
using this technology platform  bioarray offers complete assay solutions called the beadchip system 
the beadchip system includes beadchips featuring proprietary array designs as well as an automated array imaging system with snapshot image acquisition and the imagestudio suite of integrated image analysis programs 
the resulting integrated assay delivery system enables users to simultaneously perform dozens of customized tests on each patient sample in a semi automated fashion 
we believe this versatility makes the beadchip format ideally suited to a wide scope of applications 
the beadchip system  which has not yet received fda approval  is currently installed in a number of leading donor and transfusion centers for research applications 
we believe that molecular immunohematology  or the dna analysis of blood for the purpose of transfusions  will revolutionize transfusion medicine 
we believe that our acquisition of bioarray provides new  strategic growth markets for the company in both our current market of transfusion through an offering complementary to our current product offerings as well as the potential new market of transplantation 
our leadership in blood banking industry automation and bioarray s leadership in molecular diagnostic systems for specialty transfusion applications should allow us to develop and deliver more precise molecular immunohematology solutions to enhance patient outcomes 
we also believe our proven strength in developing automated instruments combined with our fda licensing and ce mark process experience  our established distribution network  our sales and marketing capabilities as well as our financial resources will generate enhanced long term growth opportunities for the commercialization of bioarray s beadchip system 
in connection with the transaction  bioarray formed a new company intended to commercialize bioarray s technology in fields outside of blood transfusion and transplantation 
the former equity holders of bioarray received an ownership interest in the new company  and immucor  through bioarray and for no additional consideration  received a ownership interest 
in the allocation of the bioarray purchase price  no value was allocated to immucor s interest in the new company 
in april  immucor bought back the rights to the bioarray technology from the new company for approximately million 
as part of the liquidation of the new company  immucor received approximately  in cash from the net assets  proportional to immucor s ownership interest 
we are currently working on the next generation molecular immunohematology instrument that will facilitate the further commercialization of this innovative technology 
our current timeline is to have a research use only instrument available in the first half of calendar recent developments two significant recent developments are the acquisition of bioarray and the development of the next generation automated instrument to allow the full scale commercialization of our acquired molecular immunohematology offering  which are discussed above under bioarray acquisition 
the following discusses other recent developments in our business 
continued market penetration of the echo instrument we launched our latest instrument  the echo  in the first quarter of fiscal targeted at the small to medium sized hospital market  echo features stat functionality  exceptional mean time between failures and what we believe is the fastest turnaround time in the industry 
we expect echo to appeal to the small to medium sized hospitals  the largest segment of our market  numbering approximately  worldwide 
as of may   we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements had received orders for a total of echo instruments worldwide 
we believe continued market penetration of echo will be a growth driver for the company 
upcoming launch of galileo neo we are currently developing a new version of the galileo  named the galileo neo  which will be our fourth generation automated instrument 
we believe the original galileo  which was launched in western europe in and in the us in  is approaching its natural replacement cycle of years 
galileo neo  like the original galileo  will be targeted at high volume customers large hospitals  donor centers and reference laboratories 
we expect the galileo neo will have faster turnaround times and a longer mean time between failures than the current galileo as well as new features such as stat functionality 
we expect fda clearance towards the end of calendar and a first calendar quarter launch for galileo neo 
international expansion during fiscal  we took steps to enable us to sell directly to the end users eg  hospitals in the markets of the united kingdom uk and france  where we previously sold our products through distributors 
in the uk  we acquired our distributor in june  and in france  we established our own operations  an effort that began in fiscal while we have roughly one third of the worldwide market  approximately of our revenue is derived from the us we believe that through our innovative automation and reagent offerings we can expand our footprint in our overseas markets 
fda administrative action on june   we announced that the fda  in an administrative action based on a january inspection  issued a notice of intent to revoke our biologics license with respect to our reagent red blood cells and anti e monoclonal blood grouping reagent products 
under this administrative action  we have the opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance before the fda initiates revocation proceedings or takes other action 
the fda did not order the recall of any of our products or restrict us from selling these products 
this administrative action was a follow on to a warning letter that we had received in may we had been working on an fda approved remediation plan  submitted after the warning letter  but had failed to make adequate progress at the time of the fda s follow up january inspection 
during our fiscal third quarter of  we formalized efforts to improve our quality systems through the quality process improvement project  which is discussed in further detail below 
we continue to implement the project and believe that  in addition to addressing the deficiencies noted by the fda  we will have a world class quality system upon its completion 
we expect the project to be completed during our third fiscal quarter of quality process improvement project during our third fiscal quarter of  we formalized our efforts to improve the processes and procedures of our quality department through establishing the quality process improvement project 
the project expanded the role of consultants hired in april the project s objective is to deliver on our commitment of maintaining a world class quality system 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million on the project  which was primarily reflected in cost of goods sold 
we expect to incur million to million of project related expenses in fiscal the project expenses primarily represent the cost of external consultants who are assisting us with the project 
we are targeting to complete the project during our third fiscal quarter of the us department of justice subpoena on april   we announced that we had received a subpoena from the us department of justice  antitrust division related to an investigation of possible violations of the federal criminal antitrust laws in the blood reagents industry 
the subpoena requires us to produce documents for the period beginning september  through the present 
we are cooperating fully with the department of justice 
antitrust lawsuits since may  a series of lawsuits have been filed against immucor  ortho clinical diagnostics  inc and johnson johnson health care systems  inc alleging that those companies conspired to fix blood reagent prices 
these lawsuits are in the preliminary stages 

table of contents 
index to financial statements instruments in the past two fiscal years  we continued our focus of increasing market share and  therefore  revenue through the execution of our automation strategy 
we have had strong market acceptance of our echo instrument and have continued executing our pricing strategy to drive automation 
we believe innovation is a key competitive advantage we have in the industry 
to that end  our development of the next generation galileo instrument  the galileo neo  continues and we expect a first calendar quarter worldwide launch of our new high volume offering 
additionally  in fiscal  we believe that our acquisition of bioarray positions us as a first mover in the exciting new field of molecular immunohematology 
we believe that the dna typing of blood for transfusion will revolutionize transfusion medicine 
we are currently in the process of developing the next generation molecular immunohematology instrument that will help us further commercialize the bioarray technology 
our current timeline is to have a research use only instrument available in the first half of calendar instrument placements are at the core of our automation strategy and we track instrument orders as an indication of our progress 
for markets in which we sell directly to the end user eg  a hospital  the process is as follows we receive the order  we schedule installation of the instrument and customer staff training  the customer performs validation testing of the instrument  the instrument begins generating recurring reagent revenue at its expected annualized run rate 
as of may   we had received orders for a total of echo instruments worldwide since the instrument s launch in june  including orders in europe including distributors  orders in the us and canada  and orders in japan 
approximately of these echo instruments were generating reagent revenue at the expected annualized run rate at the end of fiscal we believe the market for echo worldwide is approximately  hospitals  the largest segment of our market 
for galileo  as of may   we had received a total of galileo instruments orders worldwide since launch  including orders in europe including distributors  orders in the us and canada  and orders in japan 
approximately of these galileo instruments were generating reagent revenues at the expected annualized run rate at the end of fiscal revenue and expenses related to the sale of instruments is accounted for under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf mandates the deferral of certain revenue for sales agreements that have multiple deliverables while also mandating the upfront expensing of the related costs 
the reagent contracts that are signed when customers automate typically have reagent price guarantee clauses 
in accordance with eitf  when instruments are sold versus rented the instrument costs are expensed when the sale is made and the related instrument revenue is deferred and recorded as income over the term of the underlying reagent contract 
if an instrument is rented  then the revenue and expenses are recognized ratably over the contract period 
while the overall transaction economics may be similar  this accounting treatment may result in margin improvement or degradation depending on the sales mix of instruments purchased or rented by the end users in the period 
historically  the galileo is purchased of the time 
for the echo  in fiscal  we experienced a rental rate of more than for new instrument orders in the us as of may  and may   we had deferred revenue of approximately million and million  respectively  and a major portion of these balances related to the deferral of revenue from sales of instruments

revenue increased by approximately million  or approximately  during the year ended may  compared with the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to approximately million from price contributions  which included incremental revenue from both contractual and discretionary sources  and approximately million from volume contributions  which included incremental revenue from instrument placements 
these increases were offset by a negative currency impact of approximately million 
approximately of our fiscal consolidated revenue is from the us and is from international sales largely denominated in local currency  with the majority of this revenue in euros  canadian dollars  british pounds and yen 
as a result  our consolidated revenue expressed in dollars benefits when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens in relation to other currencies 
for fiscal  our consolidated gross margin increased to from achieved in fiscal  primarily due to margin improvements in traditional reagents and instruments 
during the current fiscal year  we spent approximately million on our quality process improvement project  which was primarily reflected in cost of sales

index to financial statements traditional reagent revenue increased by approximately million  or approximately  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to price contributions  which included incremental revenue from both contractual and discretionary sources 
traditional reagent sales  which accounted for approximately two thirds of total revenue in fiscal  have historically been a significant portion of our revenue 
we expect our revenue mix to change over time as we place more instruments in the market  which results in increased sales of our capture reagents 
capture revenue increased by approximately million  or approximately  in fiscal over the prior year primarily due to increased volume 
sales of capture reagents are largely dependent on the number of installed instruments requiring the use of our proprietary capture technology 
as we continue to place more instruments in the market  we expect revenue from capture reagents to continue to increase 
revenue from instruments increased by approximately million  or approximately in fiscal compared with fiscal due to increased instrument placements 
historically  revenue from instrument sales in the united states has been recognized over the life of the underlying reagent contract when it includes a price guarantee  which is normally five years 
in fiscal  approximately million of deferred revenue was recognized from previously placed instruments compared to million recognized in fiscal we deferred approximately million of instrument and associated service revenues related to instrument placements in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal we had increased rentals of instruments in the current year  which resulted in revenue being recognized over the term of the contract as earned  versus deferred and amortized as in the case of the instrument being sold 
as of may  and may   deferred instrument and service revenues totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the sale of molecular immunohematology products produced by bioarray resulted in million in revenue during fiscal bioarray was acquired on august  we discontinued manufacturing collagen products in the second quarter of fiscal when our commitment to a third party expired  which resulted in a revenue decrease of million in fiscal gross margin for the year ended may  change amount amount margin amount margin in in in traditional reagents capture reagents instruments molecular immunohematology collagen the determination of gross margin is exclusive of amortization expense which is presented separately as an operating expense in the income statement 
gross margins on traditional reagents increased to in fiscal from in the prior year  primarily due to higher revenue without a proportionate increase in cost of sales 
during the current fiscal year  we spent approximately million on our quality process improvement project 
these costs were primarily reflected in traditional reagent cost of sales 

table of contents 
index to financial statements for fiscal  capture product gross margins decreased to from in the prior year primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations and product sales mix 
gross margins on instruments increased to in fiscal from in the prior year  primarily due to sales mix 
in the prior year  more instruments were sold and in the current year more instruments were rented 
where sales contracts have reagent price guarantee clauses which our automation contracts typically do  instrument costs are expensed when the sale is made  but the related instrument revenue is deferred and recorded as income over the term of the contract 
when an instrument is rented  revenue and expenses for the transaction are recognized evenly over the life of the contract 
additionally  current year margins benefited from the recognition of revenue deferred from prior periods 
in fiscal  we recognized million more deferred revenue than in the prior year 
operating expenses for the year ended may  change amount in thousands research and development selling and marketing distribution general and administrative restructuring expense amortization expense and other total operating expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal over the prior year  primarily due to the acquisition of bioarray  which took place in the first quarter of this fiscal year  and the development activities around the acquired molecular immunohematology offering 
selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to the addition of new affiliates in france and the united kingdom  and the bioarray acquisition 
distribution expenses rose by approximately million in fiscal over the prior year  primarily due to an increase in freight charges and other general expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal over the prior year  primarily due to the addition of bioarray and our affiliates in the united kingdom and france 
amortization expense increased by approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal due to amortization of finite lived intangibles that were recorded upon the acquisition of bioarray and our affiliate in the united kingdom 
both acquisitions occurred in the first quarter of this fiscal year 
non operating income for the year ended may  change amount in thousands non operating income 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the year over year decrease in non operating income was primarily attributable to lower interest income due to our lower cash balance as well as a decrease in interest rates 
cash on hand was lower in fiscal as a result of the acquisitions made in the first fiscal quarter 
additionally  non operating income was lower as a result of higher foreign exchange losses related to an intercompany receivable 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to increased pre tax income 
the effective income tax rate was in the current year compared with in the prior year 
the tax rates in the current year periods were favorably impacted primarily by an increase in research and development credits following the bioarray acquisition and lower statutory rates in italy 
as a result of using compensation cost deductions arising from the exercise of nonqualified employee stock options and vesting of restricted shares for federal and state income tax purposes  we realized income tax benefits of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the majority of the exercises that contribute to the tax benefit are exercises of options that were granted prior to the adoption of sfas r 
therefore  as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  these income tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements as additions to additional paid in capital rather than as reductions of the respective income tax provisions in the consolidated financial statements because the related compensation deductions were not recognized as compensation expense for financial reporting purposes 
our income tax liability is reduced by these amounts

the growth in traditional reagent revenue ie products not using our patented capture technology in fiscal compared to fiscal occurred mainly as a result of price increases in the united states 
traditional reagent sales have historically been our primary source of revenue and still constitute roughly of our revenue 
we expect the significance of this line of products to gradually decline as we place more instruments in the market and increase sales of our capture products 
sales of capture products increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal mainly due to volume increases million and price increases million in the us  exchange rate gains million due to the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar and an increase million attributable to our foreign affiliates 
sales of capture products are largely dependent on the number of installed instruments requiring the use of capture reagents 
as we succeed in placing more instruments in the market  we expect revenue from capture products to increase 
revenue from instruments increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  million of deferred revenue was recognized from previously placed instruments compared to million recognized in fiscal most instrument sales in the united states are recognized over the life of the underlying reagent contract  which is normally five years

though there were small improvements in gross margin percentages in all categories except collagen in fiscal  the same overall gross margin of was achieved in fiscal and fiscal  due to a change in the sales mix 
in the case of instruments  comparing gross margin from period to period can be misleading because of the way revenue and cost for certain types of instrument sales are recorded

contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
while we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings

revenue from the sale of our reagents to distributors is recognized fob customs clearance when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
medical instrument sales revenue from the sale of our medical instruments without multiple deliverables is generally recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations 
revenue from rentals of our medical instruments is recognized over the term of the rental agreement 
instrument service contract revenue is recognized over the term of the service contract 
in cases of sales or rentals of instruments with multiple deliverables  we recognize revenue on the sale of medical instruments in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our medical instrument sales contracts with multiple deliverables include the sale or rental of an instrument including delivery  installation and training  the servicing of the instrument during the first year  and  in many cases  price guarantees for reagents and consumables purchased during the contract period 
we have determined the fair value of certain of these elements  such as training and first year service 
if the agreement does not include any price guarantees  the sales price in excess of the fair values of training and service is allocated to the instrument itself and recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations relating to training and or installation 
the fair value of a training session is recognized as revenue when services are provided 
the fair value of first year service is recognized over the first year of the contract 
if the agreement contains price guarantees  the entire arrangement consideration is deferred and recognized over the related guarantee period due to the fair value of the price guarantee not being determinable at the point of sale 
the allocation of the total consideration  which is based on the estimated fair value of the units of accounting  requires judgment by management 
ii trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables at may   totaling million  and at may   totaling million  are net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their debts 
the collectibility of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
if it is determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered 
iii inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market net realizable value 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company also allocates certain general and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements administrative costs to inventory and incurred approximately million  million and million of such costs in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company had approximately million and million of general and administrative costs remaining in inventory as of may  and may   respectively 
we use a standard cost system as a tool to monitor production efficiency 
the standard cost system applies estimated labor and manufacturing overhead factors to inventory based on budgeted production and efficiency levels  staffing levels and costs of operation  based on the experience and judgment of management 
actual costs and production levels may vary from the standard established and such variances are charged to the consolidated statement of income as a component of cost of sales 
since us generally accepted accounting principles require that the standard cost approximate actual cost  periodic adjustments are made to the standard rates to approximate actual costs 
no material changes have been made to the inventory policy during fiscal   or iv goodwill on adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets that have finite lives are continuing to be amortized over their useful lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using primarily the income  or discounted cash flows  approach 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed during the year resulted in no impairment charges 
v income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  and we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  carry back opportunities  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we assess the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

vi stock based employee compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r  requiring companies to record share based payments to employees as compensation expense at the grant date fair value 
we adopted sfas r on june   using the modified prospective transition method  which requires that i compensation costs be recorded as earned for all unvested stock options outstanding at the beginning of the first fiscal year of adoption of sfas r based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and ii compensation costs for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to the adoption be recorded  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  we have not restated the financial statements for prior periods and those statements do not include the impact of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we elected to attribute the value of share based compensation to expense using the straight line method  which was previously used for disclosing our pro forma information required under sfas prior to adopting sfas r  we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing activities 
excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock compensation costs for such options 
we elected to value our share based payment awards using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes model  which was previously used for disclosing our pro forma information required under sfas for fiscal year the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the black scholes model requires the input of certain assumptions 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of sfas r 
we have calculated our additional paid in capital pool apic pool based on the actual income tax benefits received from exercises of stock options granted after the effective date of sfas using the long method 
the apic pool is available to absorb any tax deficiencies subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method negatively impacts our results of operations 
the future impact of adoption of statement no 
r will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future  expected volatilities and expected useful lives  among other factors  present at the grant date
