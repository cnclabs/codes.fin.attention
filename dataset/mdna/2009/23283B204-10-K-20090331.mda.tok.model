item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the discussion in this section regarding the company s business and operations includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements consist of any statement other than a recitation of historical fact and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  expect  anticipate  estimate  or continue  or the negative thereof or other variations thereof or comparable terminology 
you are cautioned that all forward looking statements are speculative  and there are certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ from those referred to in such forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report 
the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
the following should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
certain numbers in this section have been rounded for ease of analysis 
currently  the company s revenues are primarily earned through its licensing agreements 
these revenues  net of related royalty and contingent legal fees  represent the primary source of cash from operations for the company 
cash generated from the company s licensing agreements is wholly dependent on covered sales generated by its licensees  which are entirely outside of the company s control and the company cannot provide any assurance that these levels will continue 
these revenues  which constituted approximately of the company s revenues in  will cease by the end of november as the underlying license agreements expire at that time 
sales of the company s products are currently very modest 
in the first quarter of  cytomedix initiated a deliberate strategic launch designed to refine improve the sales approach for the autologel tm system and provide incremental investment in the sales and marketing efforts 
since that time  the company s efforts have mostly been spent on filling open sales representative positions to provide adequate territorial coverage  strengthening product positioning to leverage the competitive advantages of autologel tm as compared to competing technologies  identifying and responding to potential resistance to market acceptance  and refining the coordination of the company s clinical and scientific personnel with its sales team 
based on the experience and knowledge gleaned in  the company implemented a significantly revamped selling approach beginning in january this new approach focuses on the scientific mechanisms underpinning autologel tm  and leverages the company s significant clinical expertise in chronic wound care 
part of this new sales approach includes heavy clinical involvement by our staff to assist prospective customers in conducting intensive on site evaluations of autologel tm and offering on going support to existing customers in order to optimize healing outcomes 
although very early  this new approach is eliciting positive customer responses to the new messaging and tactics 
the company continues to target selected submarkets  including the veterans administration and other government agency health facilities as well as capitated payment scheme environments such as long term acute care facilities 
the company s revenues are generally insufficient to cover its operating expenses 
operating expenses primarily consist of employee compensation  professional fees  consulting expenses  and other general business expenses such as insurance  rent  and sales and marketing related items 
cash outflows from operations generally result from operating expenses 
these cash outflows have remained fairly stable over the past several quarters 
the company does not believe that historical results are indicative of future expense levels as such future expense levels will likely change as developments warrant 
for example  the company has begun further investment in its sales and marketing efforts in conjunction with clinically intensive sales approach previously discussed 
additionally  spending levels will be impacted by how aggressively the company pursues other strategic initiatives such as the further development of its ct anti inflammatory peptide or other applications for autologel tm 

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenues rose  to  comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the previous year 
revenues are normally generated from two sources the sale of the disposable kits and reagents and royalties received from licensing activities 
the increase was due to increased royalties of  and higher product sales of  increases in royalties were due to stronger performance by the company s licensees 
product sales modestly increased as the company initiated a deliberate strategic launch of the autologel tm system in early on the heels of fda clearance of that product in late gross profit gross profit rose  to  comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the previous year 
for the same periods  gross margins rose to from 
the increase in gross profits is attributable to improved margins and higher revenues 
gross margins on royalties improved due to reduced contingent legal fees pursuant to the company s agreement with its patent counsel reached on august  see note to the financial statements for a further discussion of this agreement 
gross margins on product sales declined to due to a shift in mix  a mix the company believes could be fairly representative of future sales 
royalties from the licensing agreements with depuy spine  inc  inclusive of the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the initial deposit of  generate a gross margin of approximately 
royalties from the arteriocyte medical systems  inc license agreement assigned from medtronic  inc generate a gross margin of approximately 
gross margins generated from all other licensing agreements are approximately 
operating expenses operating expenses rose  to  comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the previous year 
a discussion of the various components of operating expenses follows below 
salaries and wages salaries and wages rose  to  comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the previous year 
the increase was primarily due to the accrual of the present value of a severance package for the former ceo  increased equity based compensation  and more employees  partially offset by reduced bonus expense  resulting primarily from the reversal of the bonus accrual of the former ceo 
consulting expenses consulting expenses rose  to  comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the previous year 
the increase was primarily due to non cash equity based compensation expenses associated with the modification of some consultant warrants  and the increase use of marketing consultants  to assist in product messaging and commercial reimbursement strategy 
professional fees professional fees fell  to  comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the previous year 
professional fees consist primarily of legal and accounting services 
the decrease was primarily due to non cash equity based compensation  to the company s patent counsel  recorded in  in exchange for a waiver of future contingent legal fee obligations on existing license agreements see note to the financial statements for a further discussion of this agreement and reduced audit fees  as the company incurred additional fees related to its financial restatements filed with the sec in november trials and studies trials and studies expenses rose  from zero  comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the previous year 
these costs were associated with the company s taps program post market surveillance study  which it began incurring in the third quarter of  and costs 
table of contents associated with development of its ct anti inflammatory peptide  which it began incurring in the fourth quarter of  as it prepares for submission of an ind in the first half of the company estimates that the taps program will cost approximately  over the next three years  and it will cost approximately  to advance the ct project through phase i clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses rose  to  comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the previous year 
increases in marketing  travel  recruiting fees  and various other expenses  were partially offset by decreases in non cash equity based compensation to directors and service providers  and nyse amex filing fees 
impairment of goodwill and patents impairment of goodwill and patents expense was  for the year ended december  the impairment charge was due to the reduced value of the company s intellectual property as a result of its negative cash flows and the substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern 
there was no impairment charge in other income other income fell  to  comparing the year ended december   to the same period in the previous year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower interest income  earned on cash investments  partly offset by increased patent litigation settlements  resulting from a balloon payment to cytomedix under an existing agreement which was accounted for on a cash basis due to the uncertainty of collectability 
liquidity and capital resources there exists substantial doubt that the company will continue as a going concern 
the company believes that it has adequate cash to fund operations through the fourth quarter of  however  this belief is based on the successful execution of its new sales strategy in the current market and resulting increase in revenue from product sales 
furthermore  there is no assurance that the company will have adequate funding to enable it to operate beyond that point or to reach a point of self sustainability without additional financing 
the licensing agreements  under which the company s royalty revenues are generated  expire in late november this revenue  which constituted approximately of the company s revenues in  will cease at that time and there is no assurance that the company will be able to replace this revenue through increased sales of its products or new license agreements 
additional cash will likely be required for the company to pursue all elements of its strategic plan 
specific programs that may require additional funding may include development of ct beyond a phase i trial  accelerated investment in the sales and marketing areas beyond what is currently forecasted  significant new product development or modifications  conduct of the trials the company may deem necessary in order to obtain cms coverage  and pursuit of certain other attractive opportunities for the company 
the company is exploring potential strategic partnerships for some of these endeavors  which could likely provide a capital infusion to the company 
however  it may be necessary to partner one or more of the company s technologies at an earlier stage of development  which could cause the company to share a greater portion of the potential future economic value of those programs with its partners 
the company may also consider raising capital through the issuance of its equity securities  though this may result in significant dilution to its investors 
the company continuously assesses the state of the capital markets and its access to capital 
it weighs the cost of capital and dilutive effects of equity issuance against the expected benefits of accelerating the pursuit of certain strategic objectives 
the company s ability to raise additional capital is dependent on the state of the financial markets at the time of any proposed offering 
given the current state of the financial markets  the likelihood of a capital raise may be significantly diminished 
the company is also exploring the possibility of obtaining grant funding for some of its on going projects  but it is too early to determine whether these efforts are likely to be successful 
because the company was in bankruptcy in  the company may not be able to obtain debt financing 
there is no assurance that additional funding  through any of the aforementioned means  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms  the company s operations would be materially negatively impacted 

table of contents the company has certain warrants that are callable  subject to certain requirements including a minimum per share price ranging from to  at an aggregate exercise price of approximately million 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company has begun implementation of a post market surveillance study per its understanding reached with the fda 
the company estimates that this new study will cost approximately  over the next three years  and of that amount  approximately  will be expended in the next months 
prospects for the future cytomedix s success is directly dependent on its ability to generate sales of the autologel tm system  and to further develop the other product candidates in its pipeline 
the company believes that autologel tm has a reasonable chance for success in the marketplace 
first and foremost  the company believes that  based on the results of the company s clinical trial and other historical data as well as the results of a pharmaco economic study  the autologel tm system has higher healing rates for diabetic foot ulcers and is more cost effective than most other wound treatments 
additionally  the company believes that autologel tm offers similar clinical and cost advantages when used to treat other chronic and open cutaneous wounds 
although still very early  the company s revised sales strategy  centered around heavy clinician to clinician interaction  is meeting with very positive response from potential and existing customers 
however  given limited resources  sales increases are expected to be relatively incremental 
the company owns the patents on the process for utilizing platelet gel for treating damaged tissue and wound healing  which is the basis of its license agreements  through november and for the specific formulation of autologel tm  which it believes provides several competitive advantages  and which patents expire in the company s also believes that the autologel tm system is the only prp gel system with a chronic wound indication from the fda  thus affording another competitive advantage 
while the existing cms decision of non coverage of autologous blood derived products when used on chronic wounds will continue to restrict the company s ability to target the entire wound care market  it will not have an impact on the company s current sales and marketing strategy which targets selected sub markets with established payment pathways for its products 
the company believes that pre clinical data on ct is promising 
the company believes that the magnitude of the potential markets for ct  along with the potential competitive advantage over existing therapies  could make ct an attractive partnering opportunity for well established drug and biological therapy companies 
such partnerships could provide cytomedix with initial and milestone based capital infusions and on going licensing revenues 
however  the ability to secure such a partnership and the attractiveness of the terms to cytomedix is in part a function of how far through development cytomedix can take ct on its own 
cytomedix has other product candidates covered by its intellectual property that have various levels of data supporting their safety and efficacy 
the company is currently evaluating the relative opportunities of these product candidates and determining whether they warrant further pursuit that the current time 
while cytomedix s technologies and opportunities are encouraging  the company has limited resources  and is currently not self sustaining 
given the economic conditions in the overall financial markets  the availability of capital on terms acceptable to the company may be significantly diminished 
the company may therefore seek infusions of capital through strategic collaborations and or place certain projects on indefinite hold in order to conserve cash 
inflation the company believes that the rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on its operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents critical accounting policies valuation of goodwill the company is required to perform a review for impairment of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is considered to be impaired if it is determined that the carrying value of the company exceeds its fair value 
in addition to the annual review  an interim review is required if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company below its carrying amount 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in cytomedix s stock price or the stock price of comparable companies  a significant decline in the company s projected revenue or cash flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that the company will be sold or otherwise disposed of  a substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires that the company make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of its net assets 
the company completed its most recent annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of december  and determined that goodwill was fully impaired  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of this determination was primarily attributable to the substantial doubt regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern  the fact that the company continues to incur significant negative cash flows from operations  the significant decline in the company s market capitalization  and the overall deterioration in the global economy and financial markets 
this assessment was supported by the findings in the annual independent valuation that the company commissioned as of december  valuation of patents the company capitalizes the costs of purchased and internally developed patents 
this cost is amortized via the straight line method over the remaining life of the patents 
the company accounts for finite lived intangibles under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and therefore reviews the recoverability of long lived and finite lived intangible assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
the value of the company s patents  determined upon fresh start accounting in  was driven by the worden patents  which cover the formulation of autologel tm and expire in the value was being amortized via the straight line method through  and had an unamortized remaining value of approximately million at december   prior to consideration of any impairments 
given the substantial doubt regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern and the fact that the company continues to incur significant negative cash flows from operations  the company identified that it may not realize the value of these patents and has concluded that their value has been fully impaired  resulting in a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of stock based compensation under the company s long term incentive plan the ltip  it grants share based awards to eligible employees  directors  and service providers to purchase shares of common stock 
the fair values of these awards are determined on the dates of grant or issuance and are recognized as expense over the service periods 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized  and  respectively  of compensation expense for stock issued and stock options granted under the ltip 
at december  
table of contents  there was  remaining in unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options under the ltip  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of one year 
the company estimates the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing method black scholes method 
the determination of fair value using this model requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of compensation cost recognized in the company s statements of operations 
these include estimates of the expected term of the option  expected volatility of the company s stock price  expected dividends and the risk free interest rate 
these estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and may result in materially different amounts should circumstances change and the company employ different assumptions in future periods 
the company estimates the fair value of stock issuances based on the closing market value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
for share based awards issued during the year ended december  and  the expected term was estimated by using peer company information as cytomedix s history is limited 
estimated volatility was derived using the company s historical stock price volatility 
no cash dividends have ever been declared or paid on the company s common stock and currently none is anticipated 
the risk free interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share based awards 
in certain select cases  the company has issued warrants  outside the ltip  to service providers in exchange for the performance of consulting or other services 
these warrants have generally been immediately vesting and expense was recognized equal to the fair value of the warrant on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
the same assumptions and related risks as discussed above apply  with the exception of the expected term 
for these warrants issued to service providers  the company estimates that the warrant will be held for the full term 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized  and  respectively  of compensation expense for warrants issued to service providers 
at december   there was no remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to warrants 
lump sum payments from settlement agreements under certain agreements  cytomedix has been entitled to receive lump sum payments 
if the lump sum payment is deemed to be an inducement to enter into an agreement  and is applicable to some future period  then this amount is recorded as deferred revenue and amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the course of the agreement 
if the lump sum payment is deemed to be in settlement of prior infringement of cytomedix s patents by the other party  then the lump sum  net of any associated fees  is recorded as non operating income at its present value and reflected in the patent litigation settlements  net line of the statements of operations 
the determination of whether a lump sum is associated with prior infringement or is part of an inducement to enter an agreement requires judgment by the company 
a number of factors must be considered including evidence of prior sales by the other party  nature of negotiations and or court proceedings  and accounting treatment by the other party 
each agreement requires a unique assessment to determine the true nature of the lump sum payment 
further  any future lump sums deemed a settlement of past infringement will be reflected in operating income 
in and  the company recorded  and  net of associated costs  respectively  in non operating income associated with infringement settlements 
in  the company added an additional  to deferred revenues to be recognized as revenue through november recent accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted sfas no
