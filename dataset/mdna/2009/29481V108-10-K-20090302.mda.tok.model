overview we were founded in to provide cardiac safety solutions to evaluate the safety of new drugs 
we provide technology and service solutions that enable the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries to collect  interpret and distribute cardiac safety and clinical data more efficiently 
we are a market leader in providing centralized electrocardiographic solutions cardiac safety solutions and a provider of technology solutions that streamline the clinical trials process by enabling our clients to evolve from traditional  paper based methods to electronic processing using our edc and epro products and solutions 
our solutions improve the accuracy  timeliness and efficiency of trial set up  data collection from sites worldwide  data interpretation  and new drug  biologic and device application submissions 
we offer cardiac safety solutions  which are utilized by pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  medical device companies  clinical trial sponsors and clinical research organizations cros during the conduct of clinical trials 
our cardiac safety solutions include the collection  interpretation and distribution of electrocardiographic ecg data and images and are performed during clinical trials in all phases of the clinical research process 
the ecg provides an electronic map of the heart s rhythm and structure  and typically is performed in most clinical trials 
our cardiac safety solutions permit assessments of the safety of therapies by documenting the occurrence of cardiac electrical change 
specific trials  such as a thorough qtc study  focus on the cardiac safety profile of a compound 
thorough qtc studies are comprehensive studies that typically are of large volume and short duration and are recommended by the united states food and drug administration fda under guidance issued in by the international committee on harmonization ich e 
we also offer site support  which includes the rental and sale of cardiac safety equipment along with related supplies and logistics management 
additionally  under our edc solutions  we offer the licensing and  at the client s option  hosting of our proprietary software products and the provision of maintenance and consulting services in support of these products

table of contents our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual term license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services and consulting  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
our site support revenue consists of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and freight 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if so  how the contract value should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
cost of licenses consists primarily of application service provider asp fees for those clients that choose hosting  the cost of producing compact disks and related documentation and royalties paid to third parties in connection with their contributions to our product development

our international net revenues represented approximately  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of our revenues are allocated among our geographic segments based upon the profit split transfer pricing methodology  and revenues are generally allocated to the geographic segment where the work is performed 
the profit split methodology equalizes gross margins for each legal entity based upon its respective direct costs 
results of operations executive overview fiscal was a very positive year for ert with record revenue growth and profitability 
during the year we fully integrated the acquisition of covance cardiac safety services  inc ccss  the covance ecg core lab  which we acquired in november we also experienced record bookings of million driven primarily by our increased presence and competitive positioning of our cardiac safety business 
we continued to enhance our operations with staff additions and operational improvements in systems and processes which further contributed to our success 
for fiscal  we reported revenues of million  an increase of million or from million in fiscal the revenue for fiscal included million in revenue from ccss  which we acquired in november  compared to million recorded in fiscal the ccss revenues relate only to the acquired backlog as new studies booked since the acquisition have largely been initiated as ert studies 
total services revenue  which consists predominantly of cardiac safety revenue  increased during by million to million 

table of contents gross margin percentage for was compared to in the gross margin percentage included the impact of ccss  which generated net revenue of million while incurring costs of revenue of million 
operating expenses were million or as a percentage of total revenue in as compared to million or as a percentage of total revenue in operating expenses included costs related to ccss and the integration of ccss into ert of million and million in and  respectively 
operating income for was million or of total net revenues as compared to million or of total net revenues in overall in  we were able to leverage our expense structure to produce improved bottom line results 
our tax rate was as compared to in net income for was million as compared to million in and net income per diluted share was in as compared to in general business and economic conditions have deteriorated globally during the fourth quarter of and to date in and there is currently no indication of any imminent relief 
during the fourth quarter of  we have experienced an increase in the number and dollar amount of phase iii bookings  a decline in the number of thorough qtc bookings  and a delay in starts for certain thorough qtc trials and we believe these trends will continue into fiscal we believe the increase in phase iii bookings will provide us with a base of business into the future  however this business will take longer to turn into revenue as compared to thorough qtc studies 
this is reflected in the sequential decrease in quarterly revenue from million in the three months ended september  to million in the three months ended december  we believe that the decline and delays in thorough qtc trials are related to timing as the result of the uncertain economic environment  especially in small to mid sized customers 
thorough qtc trials must be performed due to regulatory guidance  however the timing of when these trials are done is discretionary 
we also experienced an increase in awards of new and expanded exclusive or near exclusive long term enterprise contracts with large pharmaceutical companies during the latter portion of fiscal  including several with which we had very little business in the past 
partially as a result of these long term commitments  we have started to invest in our sales and marketing functions and our internal it infrastructure 
we view the fundamental drivers of our business to include the level of research and development spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  the move from decentralized to centralized ecg analysis  our potential opportunity to increase our market share and the fda s continued focus on the importance of cardiac safety 
overall  we believe these fundamental drivers remain positive 
however  a continued weakened global economy could have a negative impact on future results of operations

project management fees increased million  consistent with the increased cardiac safety activity 
cardiac safety services revenue in the year ended december  included million of cardiac safety consulting services revenue as compared to million in the year ended december  beginning in january  we entered into an arrangement with a consulting company owned by our chairman  dr 
morganroth  relating to dr 
morganroth s initiation of a company consulting practice through the transition of his historic consulting services to ert 
in return  dr 
morganroth s company receives a percentage of the net amounts billed by ert for dr 
morganroth s services to our customers 
that percentage ranged between to in and was in revenues recorded in connection with this consulting arrangement approximated million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
fees incurred under this consulting arrangement approximated million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively and are included in cost of services 
technology consulting and training revenues increased due to an increase in reporting configuration revenue related to cardiac safety clients of million as well as million of epro revenue that did not exist in the third quarter of  partially offset by a million decrease in consulting on edc products 
software maintenance revenues decreased due to the cancellation and non renewals of maintenance agreements and a reduction in the number of users 
our current sales focus is on monthly and annual term license sales rather than perpetual license sales  which will lead to the erosion of maintenance revenue over time 
monthly and annual term license sales do not generate maintenance revenue as the license fee includes product upgrades and customer support 

table of contents site support revenues increased primarily due to an increase of million of revenue resulting from including the operating results of ccss recognized in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   a million increase in rental revenue from cardiac safety equipment due to additional units rented  but at a lower average price as well as a million one time billing in the third quarter of on units rented in prior periods  an increase in freight revenue of million related to additional units rented and improvements in identifying recoverable freight costs and a million increase in supplies revenue 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in equipment sales of million as more customers choose to rent cardiac safety equipment 
overall  due to the impact of the present economic conditions  we expect that revenue for may decline from the levels 
costs of revenues the increase in the cost of licenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of license revenues  related primarily to the amortization of the epro license  which we began amortizing in december the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services was primarily due to an increase of million in costs resulting from including the operating results of ccss recognized in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   a million increase in labor costs related to additional staff and salary increases  a million increase in bonus expense  million in consulting costs related to cardiac safety consulting revenue discussed above and a million increase in telecommunication connectivity expenses 
partially offsetting the increase was a million decrease in depreciation due to certain software development costs and computer equipment associated with the expert technology platform becoming fully depreciated 
the decrease in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues reflects the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the increase in the cost of site support was primarily due to an increase of million of costs resulting from including the operating results of ccss recognized in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   a million increase in freight associated with additional shipments of equipment  million increase in the cost of supplies and a million increase in labor 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decrease in depreciation expense as older  more expensive ecg equipment has become fully depreciated  a million decrease in equipment rent which was the result of our march agreement to purchase our leased cardiac safety equipment and a million decrease in the cost of equipment sold 
the decrease in the cost of site support as a percentage of site support revenues reflects the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
overall  we expect that cost of revenue may decline in due to lower expected revenues and a decrease in the costs associated with ccss 
the integration of ccss was completed in and the recurring costs related to the ccss activity are depreciation and amortization 
amortization of intangible assets associated with the ccss acquisition will decline from million in the year ended december  to approximately million in the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease will be the full year effect of the staff added during at our other offices to handle the additional workflow related to the ccss acquisition 
operating expenses the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due primarily to an increase in labor costs of million related to additional staff and salary increases and million of additional commissions 
in  we implemented a commission plan under which payments are based upon a percentage of revenue earned and bookings 
payments under the commission plan have increased as increased signings convert into revenue 
additionally  consultant costs increased million related to rebranding and other marketing efforts 
smaller increases in a number of expense categories such as advertising and marketing  royalties and stock option expense comprise the balance of the increase in selling and marketing expense 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues reflects the fact that the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 

table of contents we expect that sales and marketing expenses may increase in as we are planning to make additional investments in sales and marketing including staff additions and spending on marketing programs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was due primarily to an increase of million of costs resulting from the november acquisition of ccss recognized in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   including an increase in the provision for stay pay incentives of million 
other increases include a million increase in labor related to additional staff and salary increases and a million increase in bonus expense 
during as compared to  the cost of consultants increased million  stock option compensation expense increased million  and recruiting costs increased million 
a number of smaller increases ranging from million to million make up the remaining variance including non income taxes  professional fees and office expenses which included the cost of moving our corporate offices in philadelphia 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction due to million in severance related costs for employees terminated in february general and administrative costs directly resulting from the acquisition of ccss decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of as a result of the closure of the reno office and will become insignificant in the future 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents and investments and foreign exchange gains  offset by interest expense related to capital lease obligations 
other income  net decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as a result of our use of cash in november for the ccss acquisition  as well as significantly lower average interest rates during partially offsetting this is an increase in foreign exchange gains as a result of lower exchange rates for the british pound as compared to the us dollar 
our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included a benefit of million related to our determination that a portion of our uk subsidiary s current undistributed net earnings  as well as the future net earnings  will be permanently reinvested and a million tax benefit related to the reversal of a tax accrual for a previously uncertain tax position 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included approximately million of items that benefited the us federal tax return that were not reflected in the tax provision 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  also included a benefit from tax free interest income which declined significantly in the year ended december  we expect the effective tax rate may increase in due to the impact of the tax benefit items which reduced the effective tax rate from approximately to 
we had historically provided deferred taxes under apb for the presumed ultimate repatriation to the united states of earnings from our uk subsidiary 
the indefinite reversal criterion of apb allows us to overcome that presumption to the extent the earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
as of january   we determined that a portion of our uk subsidiary s current undistributed net earnings  as well as the future net earnings  will be permanently reinvested 
as a result of the apb change in assertion  we reduced our deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings by million during the first quarter of

the acquisition of ccss added approximately million in revenue in  which effectively offset the impact of the million of revenue we recognized in upon the termination of a digital ecg franchise at the end of august for which there was no corresponding revenue recognized in the decrease in technology consulting and training revenues was primarily related to a decrease in consulting revenue from expert eclinical clients related to protocol set up work 
software maintenance revenues decreased due to the cancellation and non renewals of maintenance agreements and a reduction in the number of users 
these declines were partially offset by maintenance on several software licenses sold during and our current sales focus is on monthly and annual term license sales rather than perpetual license sales  which will lead to the erosion of maintenance revenue over time 
monthly and annual term license sales do not generate maintenance revenue as the license fee includes product upgrades and customer support 
site support revenues decreased primarily due to a million decrease in the sale of cardiac safety equipment for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  while average monthly equipment rental revenue per unit has fallen by over from to  an increase in units rented more than compensated for the revenue impact 
additionally offsetting this decrease was an increase in freight revenues of million and supplies revenue of million  both of which were related to the additional units rented

included in property and equipment is internal use software associated with the development of a data and communications management services software product expert used in connection with our centralized core cardiac safety ecg services 
we capitalize certain internal use software costs in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for costs of computer software for internal use 
the amortization is charged to the cost of cardiac safety services beginning at the time the software is ready for its intended use 
a total of million of initial development costs were incurred and capitalized for expert for the basic functionality required for this product and were placed into production in january these costs are being amortized over the estimated useful life of five years which results in monthly amortization of approximately million 
in and  additional development costs of expert of million have been incurred and capitalized through december  to develop new functionalities and enhancements while million have been incurred for other internal use software projects 
we placed million of these assets into service in and million of the remaining assets were placed in service in january accordingly  we have commenced amortization of the assets that have been placed in service

there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will occur or that such financing will be available or available on terms acceptable to us  particularly in view of current capital market uncertainty 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of million shares  of which million shares remain to be purchased as of december  the stock buy back authorization allows us  but does not require us  to purchase the authorized shares

was to have become effective beginning with our first quarter fiscal period 
in january  fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the delay was intended to allow additional time for fasb to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen  or that may arise  from the application of sfas no 
effective january   we adopted sfas for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis 
the partial adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

r  business combinations 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at fair value as of the acquisition date 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the 
table of contents acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we were required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of prospectively 
the impact of adopting sfas r will depend on the nature and terms of future acquisitions 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently assessing the impact of fsp on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following are our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues primarily from three sources license fees  services and site support 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual term license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
our site support revenues consist of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and freight 
we recognize software revenues in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
accordingly  we recognize up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement exists  delivery of the software and related documentation has occurred  collectability is probable and the license fee is fixed or determinable 
we recognize monthly and annual term license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees are recognized evenly over the term of the service 
cardiac safety services revenues consist of services that we provide on a fee for services basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
site support revenues are recognized at the time of sale or over the rental period 
we recognize revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically twelve months 
we provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
at the time of the transaction  management assesses whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms or upon implementation or client acceptance  the fee is accounted for as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due or after implementation or client acceptance has occurred 
collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and the creditworthiness of the client 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
under a typical contract for cardiac safety services  clients pay us a portion of our fee for these 
table of contents services upon contract execution as an upfront deposit  some of which is typically nonrefundable upon contract termination 
revenues are then recognized under cardiac safety service contracts as the services are performed 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of one or more delivered elements is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual method provided that the fair value of all undelivered elements is known 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
business combinations in november  we completed the acquisition of ccss  and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed based on their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer relationships  proprietary technology and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed 
for a discussion of how we allocated the purchase price of ccss  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
future business combinations will be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  as discussed above in recent accounting pronouncements 
goodwill as a result of the ccss acquisition  we carry a significant amount of goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test at least annually 
we perform the impairment test annually as of december or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill might be impaired 
no provisions for goodwill impairment were recorded during or if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  we will base the measurement of any impairment on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management having to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent management establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the consolidated statement of operations will reflect additional income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million related to the uncertain realization of certain deferred tax assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

table of contents depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we compute depreciation on our property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from two to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term 
system development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over four or five years or  in the case of enhancements which have no stand alone use  the remaining life of the initial project 
we compute amortization on our intangible assets  other than goodwill  over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from one to ten years 
amortization of backlog from the ccss acquisition is recognized on an accelerated basis while other intangibles are amortized using the straight line method 
changes in the estimated useful lives of long lived assets could have a material effect on our results of operations 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of options using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model require estimates of the expected term the stock based awards are held until exercised  the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock options 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this form k  for a description of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary financial market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we had historically placed our investments in municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
due to the current financial market conditions  we have invested primarily in liquid money market funds 
we will continue to monitor conditions and look for prudent investment opportunities 
we actively manage our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments  but in order to ensure liquidity  we will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million 
this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
see liquidity and capital resources as part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency risk we operate on a global basis from locations in the united states us and the united kingdom uk 
all international net revenues and expenses are billed or incurred in either us dollars or pounds sterling 
as such  we 
table of contents face exposure to adverse movements in the exchange rate of the pound sterling 
as the currency rate changes  translation of the statement of operations of our uk subsidiary from the local currency to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
we do not currently hedge translation risks because any cash flows from uk operations are reinvested in the uk 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate of the pound sterling would have impacted the reported operating income for the year ended december  by approximately million
