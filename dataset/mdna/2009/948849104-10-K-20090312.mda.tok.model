the company s financial results may be adversely impacted by a competitive environment which could cause the company to reduce retail prices without a corresponding reduction in its product cost to maintain market share  resulting in lower sales and gross profit margins 
trade area the company s stores are concentrated in central and northeast pennsylvania  central maryland and suburban baltimore regions 
changes in economic and social conditions in the company s operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population demographics and employment and job growth  affect customer shopping habits 
business disruptions due to weather and catastrophic events historically have been few  but the company s geographic regions do receive varying amounts of snow annually 
such conditions could materially affect sales and expense results 
food safety customers count on the company to provide them with wholesome food products 
concerns regarding the safety of food products sold in its stores could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from the company  or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food needs  even if the basis for the concern is outside of the company s control 
any lost confidence on the part of its customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish 
as such  any issue regarding the safety of any food items sold by the company  regardless of the cause  could have a substantial and adverse effect on operation 
execution of expansion plans circumstances outside the company s control could negatively impact anticipated capital investments 
the company cannot determine with certainty whether its new stores will be successful 
the failure to expand by successfully opening new stores as planned  or the failure of a significant number of these stores to perform as planned  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of its operations 
data and technology the company s business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations 
if the company was to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems  significant losses could be incurred due to disruptions in its operations 
additionally  these systems contain valuable proprietary data that  if breached  would have an adverse effect on the company 
operating costs associate expenses attribute to the majority of its operating costs and therefore  the company s financial performance is greatly influenced by increasing wage and benefit costs  a competitive labor market and the risk of unionized labor disruptions of its non union workforce

oil prices directly affect the company s product transportation costs  as well as its utility and petroleum based supply costs
