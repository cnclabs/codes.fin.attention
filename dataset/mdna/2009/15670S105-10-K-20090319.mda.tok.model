business strategy 
our goals are to improve on profitability and pursue disciplined growth 
the principal features of our strategy are improve our cost structure and profitability 
in september  we established our cost savings and restructuring plan  which we refer to as the plan  that among other things  included consolidating our purchasing activities and manufacturing platform with the closure of two manufacturing facilities in that were integrated into existing operations  reducing corporate and field human resources  streamlining our information technology infrastructure and eliminating discretionary spending 
the plan was completed in the fourth quarter of in  we initiated the cost savings and integration plan  which we refer to as the plan  in connection with our acquisitions of commercial envelope  colorgraphics  cadmus and printegra  which we refer to as the acquisitions 
under the plan  we closed seven manufacturing facilities and integrated those operations into acquired and existing operations 
in  we continued the implementation of our cost savings and integration plan initiatives throughout our operations and reduced our headcount during by approximately  we continue to implement cost savings initiatives that will improve our profitability  both in connection with acquisitions and our ongoing operations 
we regularly assess our operations with a view toward eliminating operations that are not aligned with our core united states operations or are underperforming 
for example  we divested our canadian envelope manufacturing business  supremex  through a series of transactions in and in  we also sold three small and non strategic businesses and closed three facilities that were underperforming 
we continue to evaluate the sale or closure of facilities that do not meet our strategic goals or performance targets 
capitalize on scale advantages 
we believe there are significant advantages to being a large competitor in a highly fragmented industry 
we seek to capitalize on our size  geographic footprint and broad product lines to offer one stop shopping and enhance our overall value proposition 
as we grow in scale and increase our operating leverage  we seek to realize better profit margins through improvements in manufacturing facility utilization 
enhance the supply chain 
we continue to work with our core suppliers to improve all aspects of our purchasing and other logistics as well as to ensure a stable source of supply 
we seek to lower costs through more favorable pricing and payment terms  more effective inventory management and improved communications with vendors 
we continue to consolidate our key suppliers of production inputs such as paper and ink  and believe that significant opportunities continue to exist in optimizing the rest of our supply chain 
seek products and processing improvements 
we conduct regular review of our product offerings  manufacturing processes and distribution methods to ensure that we take advantage of new technology when practical and meet the changing needs of our customers and the demands of a global economy 
we actively explore potential new product opportunities for expansion  particularly in market sectors that are expected to grow at a faster pace than the broader printing industry 
we also strive to enter new markets in which we may have competitive advantages based on our existing infrastructure  operating expertise and customer relationships 
pharmaceutical labels  direct mail  and specialty packaging are examples of growth areas into which we recently expanded 
by expanding our product offerings  we intend to increase cross selling opportunities to our existing customer base and mitigate the impact of any decline in a given market 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
we continue to selectively review opportunities to expand within growing niche markets  broaden our product offerings and increase our economies of scale through acquisitions 
we intend to continue practicing acquisition discipline and pursue opportunities for greater expected profitability and cash flow or improved operating efficiencies  such as increased utilization of our assets 
since july  we have completed seven acquisitions that we believe will continue to enhance our operating margins and deliver economies of scale 
we believe our acquisition strategy will allow us to both realize increased revenue and cost saving synergies  and apply our management expertise to improve the operations of acquired entities 
for example  our acquisition of commercial envelope strengthened our position in the envelope market and will allow us to enhance our raw material purchasing power and rationalize our manufacturing platform 
our acquisition of rx technology in july gave us an entry into the pharmaceutical labels business  which has high barriers to entry  while also allowing us to cross sell a broader product platform to new and existing customers 
see part item of this annual report on form k for a more complete description of our business 
consolidated operating results management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated results for  and followed by a discussion of the results of each of our business segments for the same period 
our results for the year ended january  include the operating results of rex subsequent to its acquisition date 
our results for the year ended december  include the operating results of the acquisitions  subsequent to their respective acquisition dates  except for colorgraphics which was included in our operating results from july  in  the economic downturn that accelerated in the second half of the year significantly impacted the results of our operations 
our commercial print reporting unit had volume declines in substantially all of the markets we serve primarily due to excess capacity and intense pricing pressures 
our envelope reporting unit had significant volume declines primarily due to our financial services customers who historically reached targeted customers via our direct mail capabilities 
in addition  the cost of paper  film and other raw materials for our products continued to increase in in order to compete effectively in this current environment  we continue to focus on improving productivity and creating operating efficiencies by reducing our costs 
for example  in  we reduced our employee headcount by approximately  and closed a commercial printing plant in st 
louis  missouri 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded million of non cash  pre tax charges on the impairment of goodwill related to our commercial print million and envelope million reporting units 
these charges reflect actual and expected declines in net sales  operating income and cash flows  primarily as a result of the current economic downturn 
outlook the current us and global economic conditions have affected and  most likely  will continue to affect our results of operations and financial position 
these uncertainties about future economic conditions in a very challenging environment make it more difficult for us to forecast our future operating results 
we anticipate the current economic environment continuing in  and therefore  we expect declines in net sales and operating income in our businesses 
we are pursuing additional cost savings opportunities in an effort to mitigate the impacts of these expected declines 
as a result  we are developing plans for additional plant closures and or consolidations and employee headcount reductions to ensure our cost structure is aligned with our estimated net sales 
we currently do not anticipate material price increases for further  our pension expense will increase by approximately million in primarily due to asset returns being substantially lower than expected due to declines in the capital markets 
however  our pension plan contributions will remain relatively consistent with a summary of our consolidated statement of operations is presented below 
the summary presents reported net sales and operating income loss

cash provided by continuing operating activities is generally sufficient to meet daily disbursement needs 
on days when our cash receipts exceed disbursements  we reduce our revolving credit facility balance or place excess funds in conservative  short term investments until there is an opportunity to pay down debt 
on days when our cash disbursements exceed cash receipts  we use invested cash balances and or our revolving credit facility to fund the difference 
as a result  our daily revolving credit facility balance fluctuates depending on working capital needs 
regardless  at all times we believe we have sufficient liquidity available to us to fund our cash needs

from time to time we may seek to retire our outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors

notes on march   we commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation  which we refer to as the cadmus tender offer  for any and all of the outstanding notes at total consideration equal to of outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon for notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by march  interest on the notes is payable semi annually on june and december with no required principal payments prior to maturity on june  in connection with the acquisition of cadmus  we recorded a million increase to the value of the notes to record them at their fair value  which fair value increase is being amortized over the life of the notes 
on march   we paid approximately million for the notes tendered in the cadmus tender offer  using million of delayed draw term loan funding under the amended credit facilities and cash on hand 
the merger of cadmus into cenveo was a change of control of cadmus under the notes indenture 
on march  and in connection with the foregoing change of control  we extended the scheduled expiration of the cadmus tender offer until april   modified the offer to purchase each note tendered for a price equal to of outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest  and waived certain consent related conditions  which we refer to as the change of control offer 
on april   we settled payment on all notes tendered under the change of control offer  and terminated the remaining amount of the delayed draw term loan facility under the amended credit facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased in the open market approximately million of our notes and retired them for million plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the retirement of these notes  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of million  which included the write off of million of above noted fair value increase to the notes and million of fees 
these open market purchases were made within permitted restricted payment limits under our debt agreements 
notes in  we issued our notes  which have semi annual interest payments due on june and december  and no required principal payments prior to maturity on december  we may redeem these notes currently  in whole or in part  at redemption prices from to  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased in the open market approximately million of our notes and retired them for million plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the retirement of these notes  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of million  which included the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs 
these open market purchases were made within permitted restricted payment limits under our debt agreements 
supplemental indentures we entered into supplemental indentures  dated april  and august  to the indenture dated june   among cadmus  each of the subsidiary guarantors as defined therein and us bank national association as successor trustee  as trustee  pursuant to which the notes were issued 
simultaneously  we entered into supplemental indentures  dated april  and august  to the indenture dated february  among us  the guarantors named therein and us bank national association  as trustee  pursuant to which our notes were issued 
additionally  on august  we entered into a supplemental indenture among us  the guarantors named therein and us bank national association  as trustee  pursuant to which the notes were issued 
these supplemental indentures provide for the addition of acquisition subsidiaries as guarantors of the  and notes 
other debt other debt as of january  primarily consisted of equipment loans 
of this debt  million had variable interest rates with an average interest rate of  while million had an average fixed interest rate of 
interest rate and forward starting interest rate swaps we enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure of our notional floating rate debt 
as of january  and december   we had million of such interest rate swaps 
in june  million of these interest rate swaps mature 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into million notional amounts of forward starting interest rate swap agreements to partially replace the maturing swap agreements 
as of january   we do not anticipate reclassifying any ineffectiveness into our results of operations for the next twelve months 
letters of credit on january   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million and a de minimis amount of surety bonds related to performance and payment guarantees 
based on our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
debt covenant compliance as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements 
while there are certain restrictions placed on us by our various debt agreements  the primary financial covenant calculation that we follow is our maximum permitted consolidated leverage covenant  which we refer to as our leverage covenant  that is part of our amended credit facilities 
our leverage covenant threshold steps down at the end of the second quarter of see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
under our current action plans  which include the repayment of debt  we expect to be compliant with our debt covenants under our debt agreements at the end of each quarter in without an amendment 
however  we have decided that exploring an amendment to our amended credit facilities is a prudent course of action given the significant economic turmoil and unprecedented uncertainty in the financial markets 
we are currently in discussions with our lead bank about modifying the terms of our amended credit facilities 
based on discussions with our lead bank  we expect that an amendment could be concluded in the second quarter of  however  there can be no assurance that such amendment will be obtained within that time frame  if at all 
we expect any such amendment to result in upfront fees and higher interest costs 
an amendment could also involve other changes to our amended credit facilities that  while not directly related to changing the relevant financial covenant measures  may restrict our operating flexibility 
in the event we are unable to obtain an amendment  we may need to implement additional plans  including further reducing our costs and expenditures  improving our cash flows and paying down additional debt to remain in compliance with our covenants in our failure to maintain applicable financial ratios  in certain circumstances  or effective internal controls would prevent us from borrowing additional amounts and could result in a default under our amended credit facilities 
such default could cause the indebtedness outstanding under our amended credit facilities and  by reason of cross acceleration or cross default provisions  our notes  notes  notes and any other indebtedness we may then have  to become immediately due and payable 
credit ratings our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency corporate rating amended credit facilities notes notes notes outlook last update standard poor s bb bb bb b b negative october moody s b ba b b b negative june in october  standard poor s ratings services  which we refer to as standard poor s  revised its rating outlook on us to negative from stable while affirming all of our credit ratings 
moody s investors services  which we refer to as moody s  placed us on negative ratings outlook prior to our acquisition of cadmus in we believe the primary factors behind such rating agency outlooks are our business strategy of pursuing strategic acquisitions and our debt covenant calculations 
the terms of our existing debt do not have any rating triggers that impact our funding availability or influence our daily operations  including planned capital expenditures 
we do not believe that our current ratings will unduly influence our ability to raise additional capital 
some of our constituents closely track rating agency actions and would note any raising or lowering of our credit ratings  however  we believe that along with reviewing our credit ratings  additional quantitative and qualitative analyses must be performed to accurately judge our financial condition 
the current credit markets downturn that began in and continues through the date hereof makes raising additional capital expensive for any issuer 
we do not have plans to enter the current credit market for new financing given that we have no significant debt maturities until further  we expect that our internally generated cash flows and financing available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs through  however  this cannot be assured 
since january   we purchased in the open market million of each of our notes and notes and million of our notes for million  million  and million  respectively  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with these purchases  in the first quarter of we will record a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
these open market purchases were made within permitted restricted payment limits under our debt agreements 
share repurchase plan 
on july   our board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock  which we refer to as the share repurchase plan 
the share repurchase plan is effective for months and may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 
share repurchases under the share repurchase plan may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions within the governing limits of our credit agreement and bond indentures 
the timing and actual number of shares  if any  that we actually repurchase will depend on a variety of factors including price  cenveo and or regulatory requirements  and market conditions 
no purchases had been made under the share repurchase plan as of january  off balance sheet arrangements 
it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  as of january  and december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
guarantees 
in connection with the disposition of certain operations  we have indemnified the purchasers for certain contingencies as of the date of disposition 
we have accrued the estimated probable cost of these contingencies 
critical accounting matters the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
we maintain a valuation allowance based on the expected collectability of our accounts receivable  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the current creditworthiness of customers and related aging of past due balances 
as of january  and december   the allowance provided for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
charges for bad debts recorded to the statement of operations were million in  million in and million in we cannot guarantee that our current credit losses will be consistent with those in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the allowance for losses required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  we would assess the fair value of the asset or asset group and if necessary  an impairment charge would be recorded 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on our experience and internal business plans 
our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
during  and  in connection with our restructuring and integration programs  we recorded impairment charges  net on long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently recorded 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
provision for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually at the beginning of december and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  step two is completed to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
step two requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
in  we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million related to our commercial print and envelope reporting units  respectively 
in and  we did not record any goodwill impairment charges 
as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit  we estimated the fair value of each unit  primarily using the income approach 
the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit  including projected future operating results  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates  and the allocation of shared or corporate items 
the market approach was used as a test of reasonableness of the conclusions reached in the income approach 
the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of net sales  operating income  depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures 
the allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including  among others  trade names  customer relationships  and property  plant and equipment 
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable  actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units  the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  or both 
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our total enterprise value as implied by the market value of our equity securities 
this comparison indicated that  in total  our assumptions and estimates were not unreasonable 
however  future declines in the overall market value of our equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below their carrying value 
one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit had fair value in excess of its carrying amount or had carrying amount in excess of fair value for the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
for the two reporting units that had fair value in excess of carrying value  fair value exceeded the carrying amount by and of their respective estimated fair values 
for the two units that had carrying amount in excess of fair value  the carrying amount exceeded fair value by and of their respective estimated fair values 
generally  changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
that is  a change in estimated future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 
of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values  most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate 
the discount rate for each reporting unit was estimated to be 
a basis point increase in our estimated discount rates would not have resulted in any additional reporting units failing step one 
determining whether an impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred requires an analysis of the fair value of each of the related tradenames 
we determined that there was no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets  however  if our estimates of the valuations of our tradenames prove to be inaccurate  an impairment charge could be necessary in future periods 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
our self insurance workers compensation liability is estimated based on reserves for claims that are established by a third party administrator 
the estimate of these reserves is adjusted from time to time to reflect the estimated future development of the claims 
our liability for workers compensation claims is the estimated total cost of the claims on a fully developed and discounted basis that considers anticipated payment patterns 
as of january  and december   the undiscounted liability was million and million  respectively  and the discounted liability was million and million  respectively  using a discount rate 
workers compensation expense incurred in  and was million  million and million  respectively  and were based on actuarial estimates 
our self insured healthcare liability represents our estimate of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of january  and december  we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries to determine an adequate liability for self insured plans 
this liability was million and million as of january  and december   respectively  and was estimated based on an analysis of actuarial completion factors that estimated incurred but unreported liabilities derived from the historical claims experience 
the estimate of our liability for employee healthcare represents between and days of unreported claims 
while we believe that the estimates of our self insurance liabilities are reasonable  significant differences in our experience or a significant change in any of our assumptions could materially affect the amount of workers compensation and healthcare expenses we have recorded 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate which includes the us  canada and india 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax items that have been deducted for tax purposes  but have not yet been recorded as an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
as of january   we had net deferred tax assets of million and as of december   we had net deferred tax liabilities of million from our us operations 
the change in us net deferred taxes is primarily due to the million deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with our goodwill impairment charges 
as of january  and december   we had foreign net deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria under sfas  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we considered our recent operating results and anticipated future taxable income in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of and  we adjusted our valuation allowance by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  to reflect the realization of deferred tax assets 
in connection with the acquisitions of printegra and commercial envelope  we released valuation allowance against goodwill in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
in connection with the acquisitions of cadmus and colorgraphics  we increased our valuation allowance by million and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we released all but million of these valuation allowances against goodwill 
in  we decreased our valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards principally against the gain on sale of supremex  which is reflected in discontinued operations 
as of december   the total valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets was million 
the remaining portion of our valuation allowance will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
when sufficient positive evidence occurs  our income tax expense will be reduced to the extent we decrease the amount of our valuation allowance 
the increase or reversal of all or a portion of our tax valuation allowance could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 
any reversal of the valuation allowance related to stock based compensation will be reflected as a component of shareholders equity and will not affect the future effective income tax rate 
new accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt certain new accounting pronouncements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect results of operations and financial position 
risks from interest rate fluctuations and changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes 
exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations 
the interest on this debt is primarily libor plus a margin 
as of january   we had variable rate debt outstanding of million  after considering our interest rate swaps 
a increase in libor on debt outstanding subject to variable interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
we have foreign operations  primarily in canada  and thus are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended january   a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the local currency of our foreign operations would have resulted in a decrease in sales and operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
the effects of foreign currency exchange rates on future results would also be impacted by changes in sales levels or local currency prices
