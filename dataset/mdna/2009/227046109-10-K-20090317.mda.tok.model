item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation this management discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the maturity of our revolving credit facility in april  and losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
management s plans concerning these matters are also described in note the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty 
overview we are a designer  manufacturer  distributor  worldwide marketer  and brand manager of footwear and accessories for men  women  and children 
we primarily design and sell a broad offering of products that use our proprietary closed cell resin  called croslite 
croslite is a unique material that enables us to produce an innovative  soft  lightweight  non marking  slip and odor resistant shoe 
crocs shoes combine fun colors and innovative designs to provide a new level of comfort  functionality and style in the casual lifestyle footwear category 
since the initial introduction and popularity of our beach and cayman models  we have expanded our croslite products to include a variety of new styles and products and have extended our product reach and appeal through acquisitions of companies with complementary accessories and other footwear 
we continue to actively promote brand recognition through various licensing agreements  sponsorships and print and media commercials 
we currently sell our crocs branded products in countries 
we sell our products through domestic and international retailers and distributors and directly to end user consumers through our web stores  company operated retail stores  outlets and kiosks 
the broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products to a wide range of distribution channels  including department stores and traditional footwear retailers as well as a variety of specialty channels 
we currently manufacture our footwear products at our company operated facilities located in mexico and italy in addition to contracting with third party manufacturers in china  and bosnia for production of our footwear products and accessories 
we believe our in house production capabilities and the geographic proximity of our in house production facilities to certain markets enables us to make rapid changes to manufacturing schedules and provide us the flexibility to quickly ship in demand models and colors  while outsourcing allows us to lower our capital investment and retain the

during  we closed our manufacturing facilities in canada and brazil in conjunction with our restructuring activities 
see recent events below for further discussion 
recent events from our inception through the year ended december   we experienced rapid revenue growth and had difficulty meeting demand for our footwear products 
during this period  we significantly increased production capacity  warehouse space and inventory in an effort to meet demand 
this pattern changed in our revenue growth moderated in the three month period ended march  and decreased from in the three months ended june  this trend continued and accelerated throughout the remainder of and our total revenues declined during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in the year ended december   our revenues declined in the americas  and in the european market compared to the year ended december  in the asian market  our revenue growth slowed throughout  and declined slightly on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter of we believe the decline in revenues in the americas and in the european market and the moderation of asian revenue growth are largely attributable to the following factors the economic conditions in the united states  europe and asia  namely reduced consumer spending and decreased foot traffic at shopping malls  and the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines in existing wholesale channels as well as lessening demand for our products as such products reach a more mature stage in their product life and competitors enter the market with imitation products that are sold at substantially lower prices 
should the global economic conditions deteriorate further  we may experience further revenue declines in the americas  european  and asian markets 
should we fail to develop and effectively merchandise new products that appeal to the consumer  we may not be able to compete effectively and may experience further declines in revenues 
during we incurred significant charges related to restructuring and other activities undertaken to right size our business 
these charges include inventory write downs  incremental sales returns and mark down allowances  fixed asset impairments  goodwill and intangible asset impairments  and severance  facility exit and other related expenses 
during the year ended december   we experienced challenges related to the build up of inventory of our products at many of our north and south american and european customers because sales were lower than the initial internal projections of many of our wholesale customers and distributors 
certain major retailers and distributors have curtailed orders to reduce their inventories to target levels 
we also observed increased discounting of certain product styles and colors at a number of our resellers 
we are working closely with each of our key wholesale customers and distributors to provide support to facilitate a well structured work down of their inventories 
as a result of customer inventory build up  we incurred further declines in revenue during the year ended december  because of increases in sales returns and allowances 
our inventory included certain styles and colors with substantially diminished demand during the year ended december  based on decreased demand for these products  we discontinued certain styles and certain colors of other styles from our product portfolio and implemented our plan for the disposal of our discontinued product inventories 
this plan includes structured sales to established discount retailers  sales through our company operated outlet stores  warehouse sales and other disposition activities as well as donations to our soles united charitable organization 
these actions were designed to minimize adverse impacts to our resellers  distributors  and company operated 
table of contents retail channels 
we recorded write downs of million and an additional million in charges related to losses on future purchase commitments for inventory with a market value lower than cost  of which million remains accrued for the year ended december  as a result of these changes in demand  we evaluated our production capacity and operations structure  and during the year ended december   we took the following actions with respect to our operations we restructured our canadian operations by discontinuing our canadian manufacturing operations and consolidating our canadian distribution activities with other existing north american distribution operations  we abandoned certain manufacturing equipment and molds that represent excess capacity  we discontinued manufacturing operations at our brazilian manufacturing facility  we continued to consolidate our global distribution centers and warehousing  thereby decreasing our fixed costs through the reduction of our global footprint of warehouse space  and we reduced our non retail global headcount by approximately  people in we believe these actions were necessary in order to align our production and distribution capacities with our revised demand projections 
furthermore  we have taken actions to reduce our selling  general and administrative costs  including reductions in personnel  reducing our space costs by consolidating certain offices and reducing other discretionary spending 
we may incur operating losses during fiscal year if our revenues continue to decline  which may be accelerated by the current economic crisis resulting in less demand for our products 
in the event that revenues and product demand fall short of our current expectations  we will need to take further actions to reduce operating costs 
during the three month period ended september   our stock price declined substantially  which represented a triggering event for potential goodwill impairment 
as of september   we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation 
based on that evaluation we concluded our goodwill was impaired and we recorded a charge of million  which was our entire goodwill balance as of september

title passes on shipment or on receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
allowances for estimated returns and discounts are recognized when related revenue is recorded

revenues 
revenues decreased  or million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the decline is primarily attributed to a decrease in our revenues in our americas and european markets  specifically driven by a decrease in unit sales of our footwear and jibbitz products 
unit sales of footwear products decreased or million pairs  to million pairs in the year ended december   from million pairs in the year ended december  sales of our jibbitz products decreased to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  our wholesale channel revenues decreased  or million  to million  in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  we believe that this decrease is due to lower unit sales primarily resulting from lessening consumer demand due to the global economic downturn 
we believe unit sales of our footwear also declined due to the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines in existing wholesale channels as well as lessening consumer demand for our products as such products reach a more mature stage in their product life and competitors enter the market with imitation products that are sold at substantially lower prices 
declines in revenue are also attributable to an increase in sales returns and allowances which are recorded as a reduction of net revenue as sales returns and allowance increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our company operated retail locations  including retail stores  kiosks and outlets  increased to locations at december   which is up from at december  total revenue from company operated retail locations increased  or million  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we expect 
table of contents revenues from our company operated retail stores to increase in the future as we continue to increase the number of our retail locations and focus on expanding our visual and fixture merchandising platforms 
our plans for expanding retail locations in future periods may be adjusted  or suspended should economic conditions worsen or demand for our products decline 
revenues from our webstores increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in revenues during is due primarily to increased web based and other marketing efforts aimed at driving consumer awareness of our webstores 
we intend to expand our webstores and web based and other marketing initiatives into other markets depending on business and economic conditions 
the majority of our revenues during the year ended december  were attributable to our non classic footwear models 
sales of our classic models  beach and cayman  represented of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  sales of new footwear product lines represented approximately of our overall revenues for the year ended december  we intend to continue to diversify our product offerings in order to expand our brand and expect that sales of our classic models will represent a smaller portion of our overall revenues in the future 
we also intend to segment our product offerings into our various sales channels and to enhance our visual and fixture merchandising platforms in company operated and wholesale customers stores to more effectively display our expanded product portfolio 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates since december  contributed million to our revenues in the year ended december  we expect that sales in international markets in foreign currencies will continue to represent a substantial portion of our overall revenues 
accordingly  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall revenues or the comparability of those revenues from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency  the us dollar 
americas market 
our revenues from the americas decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we believe the decline is reflective of economic conditions in the united states coupled with the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines as well as the maturity of our core products in the consumer market and lessening demand for such products  as discussed in recent events above 
we experienced an increase in sales returns and allowances  which are included as a net adjustment to revenue  of or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in sales returns and allowances is primarily attributable to known and anticipated returns as well as price mark down allowances for certain product styles and colors for which we have experienced less than anticipated sell through in our wholesales customer channel  as discussed in the recent events above 
the number of company operated retail locations in the americas  including retail stores  kiosks and outlets  increased slightly to locations at december  from locations at december  revenue from company operated retail locations increased  or million  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our company operated retail locations allow us to showcase our entire product offering  which we believe results in better sales of new product offerings and increased brand awareness 
asian market 
our revenues in asia increased  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to higher unit sales period over period as we increased our direct sales in china and expanded our product offerings as well as our increase in door openings in although we 
table of contents continue to experience revenue growth in the asian market as we expand into new countries  we believe the global economic downturn and the maturity of our core products could affect our ability to grow revenues in this region and we could experience declines in revenues similar to those that we have recently experienced in the americas and european markets 
the overall increase in revenues in our asian region was partially offset by an increase in sales returns and allowances of  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in sales returns and allowances is primarily related to returns which enabled our wholesale customers to properly balance their portfolios of our products with respect to size  color and style 
we increased the number of company operated retail venues in asia to locations at december   from locations at december  revenue from company operated retail locations increased  or million  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  european market 
our revenues in europe decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in we have noted a decline in revenues in certain european countries  particularly in those which represent a more mature market for our products 
we believe a portion of this decline is due to an increased number of imitation products that we believe infringe on our intellectual property as well as the maturity of our core products in the consumer market and lessening demand for such product 
we believe the decline in revenues in our european market may result from the challenge of increased competition from producers of imitation products that are sold at lower products 
we expect to continue defending our intellectual property rights in the european and other markets to mitigate such impacts  as we deem necessary 
sales returns and allowances  which is recorded as a net adjustment to revenue  increased  or million  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in sales returns and allowances is primarily attributable to known and anticipated returns as well as price mark down allowances for certain products and other products in certain colors for which we have experienced less than anticipated sales in our wholesales customer channel  as discussed in the recent events above 
as of december   we operated retail locations in europe versus in the same period of revenue from company operated retail locations was million in the year ended december  versus thousand for the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in the year ended december  gross margin declined to in the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit was partially the result of excess capacity in our company operated manufacturing and distribution facilities  which are recognized in our results of operations as period costs 
as of december   we recorded accrued losses on purchase commitments for inventory with a market lower than cost of million  our write down of inventories relates to certain products that were or are going to be discontinued of million  including core products in colors that have experienced substantial declines in consumer demand  as discussed in recent events above 
likewise  we recorded million in restructuring related costs in cost of sales as a result of the closure of our canadian manufacturing operation  as explained more fully in restructuring charges below 
for the year ended december   we also experienced a change in our sales mix to include products with lower profit margins when compared to the sales mix for the year ended december  we now manufacture a wide range of products which require additional materials  such as canvas  cloth lining and suede  and additional processes  such as stitching  to manufacture 
as we continue to expand our portfolio and nonclassic models become a larger portion of our business  we expect this trend to continue 
the additional costs in raw materials  duties and 
table of contents processes associated with these styles ultimately result in lower gross profit margins 
these changes in our manufacturing structure  coupled with the inventory write downs  decrease in revenues and increase in returns and allowances were primarily responsible for the decrease in gross profit for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes in foreign currency exchange rates since december  increased our gross margin by million  in the year ended december  we expect that sales at subsidiary companies with functional currencies other than the us dollar will continue to generate a substantial portion of our overall gross profit 
accordingly  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall gross profit or the comparability of our gross profit from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency  the us dollar 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in marketing expenses of million  of which million is related to corporate sponsorships and million is related to advertising expenses  increases in building expenses of million related to additional retail and office space  increases in salaries and wages of million and increases in legal expenses of million as a result of increased legal fees for ongoing litigation and intellectual property enforcement 
in addition  total share based compensation expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  also included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is a net loss on changes in currency exchange rates for transactions denominated  and settled or to be settled  in a currency other than the functional currency of the consolidated entity of million compared to a net gain on changes in currency exchange rates of for the year ended december  changes in the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate expenses from our functional currencies to our reporting currency  the us dollar  from fiscal year to fiscal year contributed approximately million to our change in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect operations at consolidated companies with functional currencies other than the us dollar will continue to represent a substantial portion of our overall business 
accordingly  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall selling  general and administrative expenses  or the comparability of our selling  general and administrative expenses from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency  the us dollar 
during the fiscal year  we took certain actions to reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses 
those actions included  workforce reductions  office space reductions  and reductions in certain discretionary spending  including discontinuation of certain sponsorship and consulting arrangements 
we are continuing to evaluate our operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative expenses 
should economic conditions further deteriorate or demand for our products decline further  we may experience further declines in revenues and we may take additional actions to reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses further 
restructuring charges 
we recorded million in restructuring charges in the year ended december   of which million was reflected in restructuring charges and million was reflected in cost of sales 
we did not recognize any restructuring charges during the year ended december  during  we announced our decision to restructure our north american operations

accordingly  restructuring charges of million related to our facility operating leases were established during the 
table of contents year ended december   as a firm cease use date was established relating to these leases 
this is our estimated future expense related to the future abandonment of facilities under the operating leases in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we recorded million in the year ended december  related to early termination costs for certain equipment operating leases  cancellation of purchase obligations and freight and duty charges related to transferring inventory and equipment to the united states and mexico facilities

the impairment charge on molds relate to shoe styles that we either no longer intend to manufacture or styles for which we have more molds on hand than necessary to meet projected demand

million write off of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting of million in goodwill related to the closure of fury  and million in goodwill written off as a result of an impairment analysis 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or million  to million in the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is the result of larger borrowings against our revolving credit facility for a larger portion of the year in compared to other income expense  net 
other income decreased  or million  to million in the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest bearing cash and cash equivalents 
income tax expense 
during the year ended december   we recognized an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million  compared to income tax expense of million on pre tax income of million for the year ended december  the effective income tax rate was a tax benefit rate during the year ended december  compared to a tax expense rate during the year ended december  the decrease in effective tax rate is primarily the result of valuation allowances being recorded on net deferred tax assets in tax jurisdictions where we believe it is not more likely than not that those tax benefits will be realized  due to our financial outlook as of december  and increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions

table of contents we are currently in discussions to obtain an asset backed credit facility to replace the existing revolving credit facility 
the time period required to procure a new asset backed credit facility may extend beyond the maturity date of our current revolving credit facility  requiring us to seek an extension of that maturity date with our current lenders 
we are also exploring other means of raising capital including equity financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing or receive an extension of the current revolving credit facility by or before the date of maturity of the revolving credit facility and  accordingly  our liquidity and ability to timely pay its obligations when due could be adversely affected 
additionally  we are currently evaluating our operating plans for and considering certain restructuring and right sizing activities to address the potential for continued decreases in revenues 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon achieving a cost structure which supports the levels of revenues we are able to achieve 
our ability to return to profitability is dependent on the timely completion of these activities and there can be no assurance that any actions taken by us will result in a return to profitability 
as discussed in the previous paragraphs  we face various uncertainties that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
these accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties 
we incurred losses of million in the year ended december  and experienced a decline in revenues from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we took certain actions to reduce our operating cost structure in response to declining revenues 
those actions included the closing of our canadian and brazilian manufacturing operations  personnel reductions  and reductions in certain discretionary spending 
should revenues continue to decline in future periods  we may be required to take further cost reduction actions in order to maintain a level of liquidity necessary to meet our ongoing operational needs 
we experienced rapid growth in our revenues and earnings from our inception through december  and had difficulty meeting customer demand for our footwear products 
during this period  we significantly increased production capacity  warehouse space and inventory in an effort to meet demand 
this pattern changed in during the three months ended march  revenue growth moderated and during the three months ended june   revenues declined compared to this trend continued and accelerated during the remainder of our total revenues declined during the year ended december  on a decline in the total number of footwear units sold compared to the previous year  which was attributable in large part to deteriorating global economic conditions  lessened demand for our products and difficulty marketing our expanded product line 
due to the decline in revenues  we incurred various one time cash and non cash restructuring and impairment costs as we took steps to right size our production and distribution capacity 
we incurred losses of million in the year ended december  and we expect to incur additional operating losses during the quarter ended march  as year over year revenue declines continue to occur 
we may incur additional losses through continued declines in revenues could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  cash flow and our ability to raise capital 
we cannot fully anticipate future conditions given the substantial uncertainties in the credit markets and the economy in general 
we may have unexpected costs and liabilities  revenue and cash provided by operations may decline  economic conditions may continue to weaken  and competitive pressures may increase  resulting in difficulty maintaining liquidity 
due to recent turmoil in the credit markets and the continued decline in the economy  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
seasonal variations in product demand and the associated changes in operating assets and liabilities in response to such seasonal variations may directly and adversely affect our cash flows from 
table of contents operating activities 
accordingly  cash flows from operating activities for any period are not necessarily indicative of cash flows from operating activities to be expected for any other period 
we are actively reviewing our expenses to ensure that future operations reflect expenses  both in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  which are commensurate with our revenues 
we will continue to evaluate the need for additional restructuring of our business in order to meet this objective 
any such restructuring activities may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and capital resources 
the changes in the global economy could also affect our customers liquidity and capital resources and their ability to meet their payment obligations to us  which in turn would decrease their credit terms and our ability to collect our accounts receivable  which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and capital resources 
we continue to monitor our accounts receivable aging and have recorded reserves as we deem appropriate 
we are a global business with operations in many different countries  which requires cash accounts to be held in various different currencies 
the global market has recently experienced many fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which impacts our results of operations and cash positions 
the future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources 
cash balances held in foreign countries have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them  which adds increased strains on our liquidity and ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities 
most of the amounts held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us  but under current law  would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
in some countries repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country 
certain countries  including china  may have monetary laws which may limit our ability to utilize cash resources in those countries for operations in other countries 
these limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the us or other countries and may adversely affect our liquidity 
we have entered into various sponsorship agreements and operating leases that require cash payments on a specified scheduled 
over the next five years we will make payments of million related to our operating lease agreements and million related to our corporate sponsorship agreements 
see contractual obligations below 
we plan to continue to enter into operating leases related to our retail stores 
our evaluation of cost reduction opportunities will include an evaluation of contracts for sponsorships  operating lease contracts and other contracts that require future minimum payments resulting in fixed operating costs 
any changes to these contracts may require early termination fees or other charges that could result in significant cash expenditures 
our inventories decreased to million at december   from million as of december  in  as the result of less than previously anticipated sales  we have been actively managing our inventory levels through decreased production and actively selling through our existing inventory with the goals of decreasing inventories and increasing our cash position 
we expect new product introductions  limitations on production capacities and seasonal variations may cause our inventory to increase or decrease materially in the future as we adjust to meet changing market conditions 
we believe our inventory levels will continue to decrease in due to projected sales and inventory management plans 
in addition to these activities to manage our inventory  we recognized million of inventory write down charges and an additional million in charges related to losses on future purchase commitments for inventory with a market value lower than cost  of which million was included as an accrued expense  for the year ended december  we intend to continue to evaluate our product offerings to develop product collections in assortments that can be merchandised effectively to the consumer at our retailer and company operated stores 
as such  we expect that our future product offerings will be more focused by category 
table of contents and for color palette and the number of color combinations will be reduced in our seasonal offerings 
during the years ended december  and  we had capital expenditures of million and million  respectively  related to the build out our global infrastructure and to support our planned future growth 
we also had expenditures of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  in related capital costs for internally developed software intangibles 
we will continue to make ongoing capital investments in molds and other tooling equipment related to manufacturing new products and footwear styles as well as those related to opening additional retail stores  however  we plan to reduce our expenditures in our distribution  manufacturing and software development efforts due to our reduction in revenues 
we plan to continue to selectively invest in information technology systems that will increase efficiencies as well as increase the operating effectiveness of our manufacturing  warehousing  and distribution operations 
we expect to continue to invest in our global information systems infrastructure to further strengthen our management information and financial reporting capabilities 
over the past two years we have developed or acquired businesses  such as jibbitz  bite  tagger  ocean minded and exo and we may acquire other business in the future that we believe are complementary to our own 
on june   we amended the membership interest purchase agreement purchase agreement with jibbitz  to amend the terms of the potential earn out consideration included in the purchase agreement 
the amendment removed the earnings targets for payment of the earn out with million payable on the effective date of the amended purchase agreement and the remaining million payable over the following thirteen months  for a total payment of million 
the earn out was fully paid as of july the agreements for the acquisitions of ocean minded and bite contain contingent earn out amounts of up to million and million  respectively  which are required to be paid as an additional cost of the acquisition if the business units achieve certain specified earnings targets in future periods 
no material amounts have been paid or accrued in relation to the ocean minded or bite acquisitions as earning targets were not achieved 
we may have to make future payments under these earn out arrangements 
in april  we acquired substantially all of the assets of tidal trade  inc tidal trade  our third party distributor in south africa  for million and acquired substantially all of the assets of tagger  a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the netherlands  for million 
there are no contingent earn out provisions related to these two acquisitions 
we anticipate that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the ongoing needs of our business through march  in order to provide liquidity beyond march   we are exploring alternatives for a new borrowing arrangement or an extension of our existing revolving credit facility and are currently negotiating with financial institutions to obtain an asset backed lending arrangement 
we may also explore other sources for capital to meet our ongoing needs 
there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all especially due to current conditions and uncertainty in the global credit markets 
our ability to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our inability to secure financing before the april  maturity date of our revolving credit facility or obtain an extension may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements our operating lease obligations  which include various building and equipment transactions  are not reflected on our balance sheet 
see contractual obligations below for further detail 
we also guarantee payments to our third party manufacturer in china for purchases of material for the manufacture of finished shoe products  which is not reflected on our balance sheet 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantee is million approximately million 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
at december   we had purchase commitments with our third party manufacturers for million in inventory 
approximately million of this commitment was for certain products at prices in excess of net realizable value  given our plans for sales of the product 
accordingly  million was recorded related to expected losses on future purchase commitments and is included in accrued expenses at december  on july   we entered into an amended and restated four year supply agreement with finproject spa  the former majority owner of crocs canada  in which we have the exclusive right to purchase the material for the manufacture of finished shoe products  except for certain current customer dealings including boot manufacturers 
based on the supply agreement  we have contractual purchase requirements to maintain exclusivity throughout the term of the agreement 
the pricing is to be agreed upon each quarter and fluctuates based on order volume  currency fluctuations  and raw material prices 
we do not believe that these arrangements are material to our current or future financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources or capital expenditures

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  intangible assets  and stock compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable  sales returns  allowances and discounts  inventory valuation  share based compensation  income taxes and goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  acquisitions and restructuring charges to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenues are derived from wholesale sales to retailers 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a valid purchase order or contract with no customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenues from sales of products when we enter into an agreement with a customer or persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  collection is reasonably assured  and title passes on shipment or on receipt by the customer depending on the arrangement with the customer 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in 
table of contents the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and we may experience changes in the amount of reserves we recognize for accounts receivable we deem uncollectible 
if the financial condition of some of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses in the period in which we made such a determination 
we may also accept returns from our wholesale and distributor customers  on an exception basis at the sole discretion of management for the purpose of stock re balancing to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments 
additionally  at the sole discretion of management  we may provide markdown allowances to key wholesale and distributor customers to facilitate the in channel markdown of products where we have experienced less than anticipated sell through 
sales returns  allowances and discounts 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns  allowances and discounts 
we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns that have not yet been received by us 
we base our estimates for customer returns and allowances primarily on anticipated sales volume throughout the year 
the actual amount of customer returns and allowances  which is inherently uncertain  may differ from our estimates 
if we determined that actual or expected returns or allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase  as appropriate  to net sales in the period in which we made such a determination 
provisions for customer specific discounts based on contractual obligations with certain major customers are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we also record reductions to revenue for estimated customer credits as a result of price mark downs in certain markets 
fluctuations in our estimates for sales returns  allowances and discounts may be caused by many factors  including  but not limited to  fluctuations in our sales revenue  changes in demand for our products and customer acceptance of new products we offer 
inventory valuation 
at least quarterly  we analyze our inventory positions and make estimates regarding the net realizable value of our inventories and  if necessary  adjust them to the lower of cost or market 
our estimate of the net realizable value for our excess and discontinued products is based on significant judgments made by management based on industry experience considering only limited company specific historical experience with the sell through of such products to liquidation or other off price channels 
the ultimate results achieved in selling excess and discontinued products in future periods may differ significantly from management s estimates of net realizable value as of december  fluctuations in our estimated net realizable value of our inventory may be caused by multiple factors  including  but not limited to  changes in company specific experience with the sell through of products  global and regional economic conditions  and demand for our products or shifting demand between the products we offer 
declines in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory  if the declines result in a write down of our inventory balance  could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 
from our inception and through  we experienced substantial growth due to the high consumer demand for our core products and our expansion into new markets globally 
during the year ended december   we experienced a decline in demand due to the current economic downturn and the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines in existing wholesale channels as well as lessening demand for our products as such products reach a more mature stage in their product life and competitors enter the market with imitation products that are sold at substantially lower prices 
based on our estimate  we recorded additional inventory write downs during the year ended december   of million and an additional million in charges related to losses on future purchase commitments for inventory with a market value lower than cost  of which million was included as accrued expenses  for the year ended december  please refer to 
table of contents note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in the index to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r  which requires recognition of the fair value of share based compensation over the vesting period of the option 
we adopted the prospective method for all stock option grants issued prior to august   which was the date we initially filed a registration statement on form s with the sec in connection with our initial public offering 
prior to august   we used the minimum value method of measuring equity share options and similar instruments for either recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes 
we continue to account for any portion of awards outstanding at the date of initial application using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards which were the provisions of apb and its related interpretive guidance 
for stock option grants issued after august   we applied the modified prospective method 
under this method we use the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options  which requires assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility  the expected life of the option and expected dividend rates 
the volatility assumptions were derived from our historical volatilities and historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating share based compensation in future periods  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during any fiscal period can fluctuate based on  among other things  future stock option grants  changes in our estimated forfeiture rate pursuant to sfas r  and changes in the assumptions used in the black scholes valuation model for future stock option grants 
because the calculation of the estimate for stock based compensation is reliant on multiple inputs  which in some cases are  themselves  estimates  an increase or decrease in any of these variables could have a significant effect on the amount of expense recognized during a reporting period 
income taxes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
effective january   we adopted fin  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law  the body of statutory  regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous 
because of this  whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
no portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
also  under fin  interest expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet  statement of operations or cash flows 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves at the time we determine it is probable we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
tax laws require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 

table of contents some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are accounted for as a temporary difference  except that deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction 
we have formulated a specific plan for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the applicable tax jurisdictions 
should we change our plans  we would be required to record a significant amount of deferred tax liabilities 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are instead measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by sfas  in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to their carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors  including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
our estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  and changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
during the three month period ended september   our stock price declined substantially  which represented a triggering event for potential goodwill impairment 
as of september   we performed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation  as required under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
based on that evaluation we concluded our goodwill was impaired and we recorded a charge of million  which was our entire goodwill balance as of september  please refer to note of our condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in the index to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives  such as customer relationships  core technology  capitalized software  patents and non compete agreements are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  sfas  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from an asset to assess whether or not a potential impairment exists when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair value 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
fair value is determined by independent third party appraisals  projected discounted cash flows  or other valuation techniques as appropriate 
during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment charge of million on fixed assets  primarily related to equipment and shoe molds 
management evaluated the production capacity at company operated facilities compared with demand projections and capacity requirements and made the decision to abandon certain manufacturing equipment that represented excess capacity 
the impairment charge on molds relates primarily to shoe styles that we either no longer intends to manufacture or to styles for which we have more molds on hand than is necessary to meet projected demand 
these charges are recorded in the impairment charges line item of the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   and are accounted for as assets to be abandoned in accordance with sfas also refer to note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in the index to consolidated financial statements  of this form k 
due to the nature of impairment charges  changes in the liabilities and expenses related to these charges incurred between reporting periods can be significant as they are driven by  among other things  changes in our strategic operational and financial decisions  global and regional economic conditions  demand for our product or shifting demand between different products we offer and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate or significantly decrease the realization of future benefits from our long lived assets 
likewise  significant impairment charges recognized during a reporting period could have adversely affected our reported financial results 
restructuring charges 
we recognize restructuring charges related to our plans to close manufacturing and administrative facilities according to sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
in connection with these activities  we recognize restructuring charges for employee termination costs  long lived asset impairment and other restructuring related costs 
we also recognize restructuring charges related to our future expense related to the future abandonment of facilities under the operating leases in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in restructuring charges associated with the closure of the canadian and brazilian manufacturing facilities 
please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in the index to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the recognition of these restructuring charges require that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
to the extent our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized 
at the end of each reporting period  we will evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 
due to the nature of restructuring charges  changes in the liabilities and expenses related to these charges incurred between reporting periods can be significant as they are driven by  among other 
table of contents things  our strategic operational and financial decisions  global and regional economic conditions  staffing levels relative to demand for our products and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate the need for certain assets or staff positions in our locations 
significant restructuring charges could adversely affect our reported financial results in the reporting period in which the charges are recognized and  to the extent we are required to make future cash payments for items such as severance and lease buyouts or penalties  could adversely affect our liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit and interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that interest rates change due to inflation or other factors 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   the effective interest rate on our revolving credit facility was 
the interest payable on our revolving credit facility is determined based on the lender s applicable reference rate plus  and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
based on this aggregate amount borrowed as of december   we would have a resulting decline in future annual earnings and cash flows of approximately million for every increase in the lender s reference lending rate 
we earned interest income of million on our cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  we have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates  and if the weighted average rate of return on cash and cash equivalents  and restricted cash  were to increase or decrease by  the impact on interest income would be approximately million  net of tax during the year ended december  please also refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity  for a discussion of risks related to the recent global economic downturn and the current state of the credit markets foreign currency exchange risk we have significant revenues from foreign sales in recent periods 
while the majority of expenses attributable to our foreign operations are paid in the functional currency of the country in which such operations are conducted  we pay the majority of our overseas third party manufacturers in us dollars 
our ability to sell our products in foreign markets and the us dollar value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in downward price pressure for our products or losses from currency exchange rates 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of foreign exchange rates 
if the us dollar were to increase or decrease  
table of contents as applicable  in value by  the impact on international sales of million during the year ended december  would have been an increase or decrease in consolidated revenues by million 
the volatility of the applicable exchange rates are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy 
in the event our foreign sales and purchases increase and are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies we receive for such sales 
please see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rate variances experienced in the year ended december  we may  in the future  engage in foreign exchange hedging contracts to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates 
if we do engage in foreign exchange hedging  the foreign exchange hedging contracts will be entered into to hedge specific commitments and anticipated transactions but not for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we did not have any foreign exchange hedging contracts
