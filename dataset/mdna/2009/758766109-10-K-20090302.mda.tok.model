overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states and the district of columbia as of january  we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations 
we also maintain an investment in national cinemedia  which concentrates on in theatre advertising and creating complementary business lines that leverage the operating personnel  asset and customer bases of its theatrical exhibition partners  which include us  amc and cinemark 
the company manages its business under one reportable segment theatre exhibition operations 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs and electronic video games located adjacent to the lobbies of certain of our theatres 
in addition  national cinemedia provides us with a theatre access fee associated with revenues generated from its sale of on screen advertising  rental of theatres for business meetings and concerts and other events 
film rental costs depend on a variety of factors including the prospects of a film  the popularity and box office revenues of a film and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs 
on february   we  along with amc and cinemark  formed dcip  to create a financing model and establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema 
future digital cinema developments will be managed by dcip  subject to the approval of us  amc and cinemark 
each of regal  amc and cinemark has an equal ownership and voting interest in dcip 
recently  dcip announced the execution of long term deployment agreements with five film studios 
dcip is continuing to work with film studios and financial institutions to negotiate and finalize the related financing plans that would provide for a studio financed conversion to digital projection 
upon completion  we are prepared to begin converting our existing theatres from mm film projection to digital projection and intend to complete the conversion of our entire circuit in approximately three to four years

table of contents of approximately million during the year ended december  in addition  as a result of the annual adjustment provisions of the common unit adjustment agreement  on april   we received from national cinemedia approximately million newly issued common units of national cinemedia 
further  on may   we received from national cinemedia approximately million newly issued common units of national cinemedia in accordance with the adjustment provisions of the common unit adjustment agreement for our increase in screens in connection with our acquisition of consolidated theatres 
these adjustments increased the number of national cinemedia common units held by us to approximately million and as a result  on a fully diluted basis  we own a interest in ncm  inc as of january  on march   regal issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we entered into simultaneous convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our class a common stock in order to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the convertible senior notes into shares of our class a common stock 
the net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was approximately million and is included as a component of equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further description of the convertible senior notes and the related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
the company used cash on hand and a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes to redeem approximately million principal amount of the convertible senior notes due may  the convertible senior notes  in a series of privately negotiated transactions 
as a result of the early redemption  the company recorded a million loss on debt extinguishment during fiscal in connection with the early redemption  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from credit suisse attributable to the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions associated with the convertible senior notes described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
such proceeds were recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
in connection with the final maturity of the convertible senior notes on may   holders of the remaining million in principal amount exercised their conversion rights

recent developments please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for a discussion of an amendment to our amended senior credit facility and other financing transactions effected subsequent to the year ended january  results of operations based on our review of industry sources  national box office revenues for calendar year were estimated to have decreased slightly in comparison to that of calendar year the industry s box office results were negatively impacted by difficult comparisons generated by high profile films released during  including spider man  transformers  pirates of the caribbean at world s end  shrek the third and harry potter the order of the phoenix  largely offset by ticket price increases and strong attendance from film releases  such as the dark knight  and films outside the highest grossing pictures 
our total revenues for the fifty three week fiscal year ended january  fiscal period were  million and consisted of  million of admissions revenues  million of concessions revenues and million of other operating revenues  and increased approximately from total revenues of  million for the fifty two week fiscal year ended december  fiscal period 
during the fiscal period  total admissions revenues increased million  or  to  million  from  million for the fiscal period 
the fiscal period results were favorably impacted by the timing of the fiscal period calendar  which consisted of fifty three weeks compared to the fifty two weeks during the fiscal period 
the additional week of operations was the week between christmas and new years  a traditionally high attendance and revenue week for the company and the industry 
the additional week of operations was significant in that it accounted for approximately million attendees  or  of the fiscal period total attendance and contributed to approximately million  or  of the fiscal period total admissions revenues 
the fiscal period results were also bolstered by the addition of the screens acquired with consolidated theatres on april  and net screens added since the end of the fiscal period 
the screens acquired from consolidated theatres accounted for million attendees  or  of the fiscal period total attendance and contributed to approximately million  or  of the fiscal period total admissions revenues 
these factors were largely offset by the impact of the decline in industry attendance during the fiscal period and as a result  total attendance for the fiscal period increased by approximately 
the fiscal period admissions revenues were also favorably impacted by a increase in average ticket prices 
price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews which include analysis of various factors including general inflationary trends and local market conditions along with the mix of film product exhibited during the fiscal period were the primary drivers of the increase in our fiscal period average ticket price 
on a comparable screen basis ie  excluding the effects of the impact of week and the inclusion of consolidated theatres during the fiscal period  attendance for the fiscal period was approximately million  a decrease from the fiscal period and admissions revenues for the fiscal period was approximately  million  a decrease of from the fiscal period 
these declines were primarily a result of the decline in attendance among the top tier films exhibited during the fiscal period  partially offset by a increase in comparable screen average ticket prices 
based on our review of certain industry sources  the decrease in our 
table of contents admissions revenues on a comparable screen basis was slightly greater than the industry s results for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
we believe the greater than industry decline in admissions revenues on a comparable screen basis was primarily attributable to the company s out performance on top tier films exhibited during the fiscal period  our less than industry average increase in ticket prices during the fiscal period and our less than industry average screen growth during the fiscal period 
in addition  during the fiscal period  on a comparable screen basis  we experienced a decrease in total concessions revenues and a slight increase in other operating revenues 
the decline in total concessions revenues on a comparable screen basis was primarily a result of the decrease in attendance discussed above during the fiscal period in comparison to the fiscal period 
average concessions revenues per patron during the fiscal period was positively impacted by price increases effected during the fiscal period 
the increase in other operating revenues for the fiscal period was primarily attributable to increases in revenues related to unredeemed gift certificates and discount tickets  national cinemedia revenues and other theatre revenues 
on a comparable screen basis  during the fiscal period  income from operations decreased million  or  from the fiscal period 
the decrease in income from operations on a comparable screen basis during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a reduction in admissions and concessions revenues  coupled with increases in certain operating expense items such as rent expense  other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization and net loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets  partially offset by increases in other operating revenues and reductions in film rental and advertising costs and cost of concessions 
the company reported net income of million in the fiscal period compared to net income of million in the fiscal period 
diluted earnings per share of class a and class b common stock was in the fiscal period compared to during the fiscal period 
the decreases in net income and diluted earnings per share of class a and class b common stock were primarily due to a million gain million after related tax effects resulting from transactions completed in connection with the fiscal period ipo of ncm  inc  the impact of a million loss million after related tax effects on debt extinguishment recorded in the fiscal period in connection with the redemption of approximately million principal amount of the convertible senior notes  the million gain million after related tax effects recorded in connection with the sale of the company s equity interest in fandango  inc fandango during the fiscal period  a decrease in operating income and incremental interest expense  partially offset by the impact of incremental earnings recognized from national cinemedia described below 
during the fiscal period  we continued to make progress with respect to the following strategic initiatives we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the fiscal period totaled approximately million 
on april   the company acquired consolidated theatres  which holds a total of theatres with screens in georgia  maryland  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and virginia  for a total net cash purchase price of approximately million  subject to post closing adjustments 
in addition to the acquisition of consolidated theatres during the fiscal period  we opened new theatres with screens  added screens through expansion of existing theatres and closed underperforming theatres with screens  ending the fiscal period with theaters and  screens 

table of contents finally  we continue to embrace new technologies to enhance the movie going experience and broaden our content offerings 
specifically  the installation of digital projection systems  when combined with d technology or imax theatre systems  will allow us to offer our patrons premium d and large format movie experiences  which we believe will generate incremental revenue for the company 
through january   we operated digital screens outfitted with digital projection systems and increased our digital d screen count to during  we announced an agreement with imax to expand our imax presence by agreeing to install a total of imax digital projection systems by the end of with the rollout of digital cinema  we expect to increase our total digital d screen count to approximately  we remain optimistic regarding the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with d film product and other d content and are pleased to see growing support of d and imax film product by the major studios 
we are optimistic regarding the breadth of the film slate and the timing of the release schedule and share the view of a number of film studio executives who believe the industry is poised to benefit from a year of solid box office performance 
evidenced by the film studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of high profile releases such as monsters vs 
aliens d  hannah montana the movie  x men origins wolverine  angels demons  night at the museum battle of the smithsonian  terminator salvation  up d  transformers revenge of the fallen  ice age dawn of the dinosaurs d  harry potter and the half blood prince and avatar d 
we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions 
with respect to capital expenditures  subject to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and replacements 
overall for the fiscal year  we expect to benefit from modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron 
in addition  we expect fiscal admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations 
we will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities  selective upgrades and providing incremental returns to our stockholders

the components of the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities related to the transactions completed in connection with the ncm  inc ipo include an increase in net income of approximately million  an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million and an increase in other liabilities of million offset by a gain of approximately million and a deferred tax benefit of million 
in addition to the changes in cash flows related to the ipo of ncm  inc  the increase in net income and the timing of other fiscal vendor payments positively impacted cash flows from operating activities and resulted in a million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal period 
net cash flows provided by investing activities totaled approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in investing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
contributing to the increase in cash flows provided by investing activities was million of proceeds received in connection with the redemption of preferred units of ncm during the fiscal period  million of proceeds from the sale of ncm common units to ncm  inc during the fiscal period  million of proceeds received in connection with the sale of the company s equity interest in fandango during the fiscal period and incremental proceeds from the disposition of assets of approximately million during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
in addition  the fiscal period included cash used for acquisitions totaling approximately million 
net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to million of incremental dividends paid to shareholders including an extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each outstanding share of its class a and class b common stock  or approximately million in the aggregate during the fiscal period as 
table of contents compared to the fiscal period  coupled with a million reduction in borrowings from the regal cinemas senior credit facility during the fiscal period  partially offset by less net cash used to settle conversions of the company s convertible senior notes and greater excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis  we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes related to corporate operations  debt service and the company s quarterly dividend payments 
the principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  cash on hand and borrowings under the amended senior credit facility described below 
under the terms of the amended senior credit facility  regal cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to regal  its indirect parent 
since regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of subsidiaries  this restriction could impact regal s ability to effect future debt or dividend payments  pay corporate expenses or redeem or convert for cash its convertible senior notes 
our revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit card at the point of sale 
our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs  rent and occupancy  and payroll 
film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately to days from purchase 
our current liabilities generally include items that will become due within twelve months 
in addition  from time to time  we use cash from operations and borrowings to fund dividends in excess of net income and cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing and financing activities 
as a result  at any given time  our balance sheet may reflect a working capital deficit 
we fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows  cash on hand  proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities 
our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres  new theatre construction  adding new screens to existing theatres  upgrading the company s theatre facilities including digital d and imax screens and replacing equipment 
the costs of implementing digital projection in our theatres will be substantially funded by dcip 
dcip and its members have yet to execute definitive agreements concerning the extent of such funding  but based on current negotiations  we expect dcip to fund the implementation of digital projection through virtual print fees from motion picture studios 
we will bear operating and maintenance costs with respect to digital projection systems in our theatres  which we expect to be similar to what we currently spend on our conventional film projectors 
should the conversion process to digital cinema rapidly accelerate and the major studios not cover the cost of the conversion as expected  we may have to incur additional capital expenditures associated with this potential change 
we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
the company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects  with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the company s internal rate of return targets 
we currently expect capital expenditures for theatre development  replacement  expansion  upgrading and replacements to be in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal year  exclusive of acquisitions 
such capital expenditures are expected to be partially funded through asset dispositions conducted during the normal course of our business 
during the fiscal period  we invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  on february   ncm  inc  a newly formed entity that serves as the 
table of contents sole manager of national cinemedia  completed an ipo of its common stock 
in connection with the ipo of ncm  inc  rch  amc and cinemark amended and restated the operating agreement of national cinemedia and other ancillary agreements 
in connection with the series of transactions completed in connection with the ipo  regal received gross cash proceeds totaling approximately million and retained a interest in ncm  inc after the payment of current taxes  net cash proceeds from these transactions totaled approximately million 
the company used a portion of the net cash proceeds to fund an extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each outstanding share of its class a and class b common stock  or approximately million in the aggregate

during the year ended december   the company sold its equity interest in fandango for proceeds of million 
as a result of this transaction  the company recognized a gain on the sale of approximately million million after tax 
in addition  during the year ended january   the company received an additional million of sale proceeds related to fandango 
accordingly  the company recognized an additional gain of million million after tax during the year ended january  in connection with the sale  the company agreed to amend its existing contract with fandango in exchange for an amendment fee totaling million 
this amount has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the six year term of the amendment 
on march   regal issued million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we entered into simultaneous convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our class a common stock in order to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the convertible senior notes into shares of our class a common stock 
the net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was approximately million and is included as a component of equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further description of the convertible senior notes and the related convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
the company used cash on hand and a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes to redeem approximately million principal amount of the convertible senior notes  in a series of privately negotiated transactions 
as a result of the early redemption  the company recorded a million loss on debt extinguishment during fiscal in connection with the early redemption  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from credit suisse attributable to the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions associated with the convertible senior notes described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
such proceeds were recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
in connection with the final maturity of the convertible senior notes on may   holders of the remaining million in principal amount exercised their conversion rights 
the company elected to settle these conversions entirely in cash for approximately million using the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes 
as a result of these conversions  the company recorded an additional million loss on debt extinguishment during fiscal in connection with these conversions  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from credit suisse attributable to the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions associated with the convertible senior notes 
such proceeds were also recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital

in addition  on may   we received from national cinemedia approximately million newly issued common units of national cinemedia in accordance with the adjustment provisions of the common unit adjustment agreement for our increase in screens in connection with our acquisition of consolidated theatres 
these adjustments increased the number of national cinemedia common units held by us to approximately million and as a result  on a fully diluted basis  we own a interest in ncm  inc as of january  regal cinemas maintains its amended senior credit facility  which consists of the term facility in an aggregate original principal amount of  million and a revolving credit facility the revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million

regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of per share on each outstanding share of the company s class a and class b common stock  or approximately million in the aggregate  during the fiscal period 
further  on january   the company declared a cash dividend of per share on each share of the company s class a and class b common stock including outstanding restricted stock  payable on march   to stockholders of record on march  this dividend reflects a per share reduction from our last quarterly cash dividend of per share declared on october  these dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand

ebitda ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization was approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the net decrease in ebitda in the fiscal period from the fiscal period was primarily attributable to the million gain recorded in the fiscal period resulting from transactions completed in connection with the ipo of ncm  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion  the impact of a million loss on debt extinguishment recorded in the fiscal period in connection with the redemption of approximately million principal amount of the convertible senior notes  the million gain in connection with the sale of the company s equity interest in fandango during the fiscal period and a decline in operating income during the fiscal period  partially offset by the incremental earnings recognized from national cinemedia 
the company uses ebitda as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity  excluding the impact of interest  taxes  and non cash depreciation and amortization charges  for servicing our debt  paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs  prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash  such as working capital items 
we believe that ebitda is useful to investors for these purposes as well 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net cash provided by operating activities  as determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  since it omits the impact of interest  taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash such as receivables  payables and inventories as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items such as long term loss accruals and deferred items 
because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized  which assets will often have to be replaced in the future 
further  ebitda  because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service  income taxes  cash dividends  capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to time as described in more detail elsewhere in this annual report on form k  does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes 
nonetheless  ebitda is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors  rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe  and we concur  that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures  pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs  respectively 
we also evaluate ebitda because it is clear that movements in these non gaap measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends 
ebitda  as calculated  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

interest rate swaps on july   regal cinemas entered into four hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with final maturity terms ranging from three to five years each 
on september   regal cinemas entered into an additional hedging relationship via a distinct interest rate swap agreement with a maturity term of four years 
these interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately  million of its variable rate debt obligations 
on june   one of our interest rate swaps designated to hedge approximately million of variable rate debt obligations matured 
on august   regal cinemas entered into two additional hedging relationships via two distinct interest rate swap agreements with maturity terms of two years each 
these interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately million of variable rate debt obligations 
on june   two of our interest rate swaps designated to hedge million of variable rate debt obligations matured 
on october   an interest rate swap agreement designed to hedge approximately million of variable rate debt obligations effectively terminated as more fully described below 
under the terms of the remaining three interest rate swap agreements which hedge an aggregate of approximately million of variable rate debt obligations as of january   regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from to and receives interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three month period 
the interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration 
at such dates  the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense 
no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the interest rate swaps  because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into 
the interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and as such  the company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the month libor on approximately million of variable rate obligations 
the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the designated hedging instruments the three interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotes  and represents an estimate of the amounts regal cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors  including current interest rates 
on september   because of the sudden deterioration in the credit standing of the lehman counterparty to an interest rate swap agreement designed to hedge approximately million of variable rate debt obligations  the company concluded that the hedging relationship was no longer expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows 
as a result  on september   
table of contents the hedging relationship ceased to qualify for hedge accounting under sfas for the period from september  through september   the company recognized million the change in fair value of the former hedging derivative as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
on october   the lehman counterparty filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  an event of default occurred under the provisions of the interest rate swap agreement between us and the lehman counterparty  which effectively terminated the interest rate swap on october   as indicated above 
accordingly  million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of october  will be reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings ie  when interest payments are made on the variable rate debt obligations as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining life of the two year original hedge as long as the variable rate debt obligations remain outstanding 
during the fiscal quarter ended january   the company released a portion of the deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss by recording interest expense net of related tax effects of approximately million and a corresponding million reduction of other comprehensive loss 
the company is in the process of determining a final termination value associated with the interest rate swap  but does not expect the termination value to be materially different from the current liability recorded approximately million as of january  as of january   the aggregate fair value of the remaining three interest rate swaps was determined to be approximately million  which has been recorded as a component of accrued expenses with a corresponding amount of million  net of tax  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss these interest rate swaps exhibited no ineffectiveness for the years ended january   december  and december  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for a discussion of an amendment to our amended senior credit facility and other financing transactions effected subsequent to the year ended january  sale leaseback transactions for information regarding our various sale and leaseback transactions  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which include those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting 
table of contents estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions 
under purchase accounting principles  we are required to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities  including i the acquired tangible and intangible assets  including property and equipment  ii the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition  and iii the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations  for significant acquisitions  we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to make these valuation estimates  which are made based on information available to us at the acquisition date 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
historically  the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and  as a result  we have not disclosed such changes 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management s best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film s opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
the ultimate revenues of a film can be estimated reasonably accurately within a few weeks after the film is released based on the film s initial box office performance  which is determined by a film s initial box office receipts 
as a result  there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable  because we make such estimates based on each film s box office receipts through the end of the reporting period 
for the fiscal years ended january   december  and december   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life to us of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than forty years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment  etc  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the 
table of contents assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our properties were appraised as part of the bankruptcy process described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended january   december  and december   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended january   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately million or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
an increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
with the exception of valuation allowances recorded relative to pre acquisition periods  decreases in the valuation allowance generally result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes 
should we ultimately realize a benefit from tax assets in excess of the amount recorded that relates to pre acquisition periods  goodwill would be reduced to the extent of such excess or recorded goodwill  as appropriate see note under recent accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
additionally  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation  require judgment by us and may be challenged by the tax authorities 
as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  effective december   the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards 
table of contents board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  in accordance with fin  we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position 
with respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate  the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes 
among other items deemed relevant by us  the evaluations are based on new legislation  other new technical guidance  judicial proceedings  and our specific circumstances  including the progress of tax audits 
with the exception of tax benefits realized relative to changes in pre acquisition uncertain tax positions  any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made see note under recent accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
for fiscal  our provision for income taxes was million
