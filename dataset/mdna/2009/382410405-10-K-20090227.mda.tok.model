essentially all of our natural gas production is sold under spot or market sensitive contracts to various gas purchasers on short term contracts 
our condensate and crude oil production is sold to various purchasers under short term rollover agreements based on current market prices 
customers 
due to the nature of the industry  we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and  accordingly  amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant

index to financial statements competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
major and independent oil and gas companies  drilling and production acquisition programs and individual producers and operators are active bidders for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as the equipment and labor required to operate those properties 
many competitors have financial resources substantially greater than ours  and staffs and facilities substantially larger than us 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production will depend in part on the cost and availability of alternative fuels  the level of consumer demand  the extent of domestic production of oil and gas  the extent of importation of foreign oil and gas  the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities  regulations by state and federal authorities and the cost of complying with applicable environmental regulations 
employees at february   we had full time employees in our two administrative offices and one field office  none of whom is represented by any labor union 
we regularly use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  particularly in the areas of construction  design  well site supervision  permitting and environmental assessment 
independent contractors usually perform field and on site production operation services for us  including gauging  maintenance  dispatching  inspection and well testing

regulations the availability of a ready market for any natural gas and oil production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of natural gas and oil production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  state limits on allowable rates of production by a well or proration unit  the amount of natural gas and oil available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or the lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of natural gas and oil  protect rights to produce natural gas and oil between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of natural gas and oil produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies as well 
environmental matters our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
compliance 
table of contents 
index to financial statements with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences  restrict the type  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the issuance of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the assessment of remedial obligations  and the imposition of injunctions that may limit or prohibit some or all of our operations 
the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition  there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental laws to which our business operations are subject and with which compliance may have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the sites where the release occurred  and those that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances released at the site 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liabilities for remediation costs at the site  natural resource damages and for the costs of certain health studies 
additionally  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
we generate materials in the course of our operations that are regulated as hazardous substances 
we also may incur liability under the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state statutes which impose requirements related to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
while there exists an exclusion from the definition of hazardous wastes for certain materials generated in the exploration  development or production of oil and gas  we generate petroleum product wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as solid and hazardous wastes 
we currently own or lease  and in the past have owned or leased  properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years 
although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances  wastes  or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us  or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal 
in addition  some of our properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances  wastes  or hydrocarbons was not under our control 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes  remediate contaminated property  or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
the federal water pollution control act  as amended  clean water act  and analogous state law  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances  into state and federal waters 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by epa or an analogous state agency 
federal 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
in addition  the oil pollution act of opa imposes a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills into navigable waters 
opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and several liabilities for specified oil removal costs and certain other damages including natural reservoir damages arising from a spill 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with the clean water act and opa requirements 
the federal clean air act  as amended  and comparable state laws  regulates emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements 
epa has developed  and continues to develop  stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable air permitting and control technology requirements 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere 
in response to such studies  president obama has expressed support for  and it is anticipated that the current session of congress will consider legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases 
in addition  more than one third of the states  either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
depending on the particular program  we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations 
also  as a result of the united states supreme court s decision on april  in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  the epa may regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks even if congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases 
the court s holding in massachusetts that greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide fall under the federal clean air act s definition of air pollutant may also result in future regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources 
in july  epa released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act  in response to the supreme court s decision in massachusetts 
in the notice  epa evaluated the potential regulation of greenhouse gases under the clean air act and other potential methods of regulating greenhouse gases 
although the notice did not propose any specific  new regulatory requirements for greenhouse gases  it indicates that federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could occur in the near future even if congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such new federal  regional  or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance or operating costs or additional operating restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand for the oil and gas we produce 
state statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
in addition  there are state statutes  rules and regulations governing conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing  plugging and abandonment of such wells 
such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and gas could otherwise be produced from our properties and may restrict the number of wells that may be drilled on a particular lease or in a particular field 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition

index to financial statements item a 
risk factors our financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
the following summarizes some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties which may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves 
we may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report 
these differences may be material 
the proved oil and gas reserve information included in this report are estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by nsa  our independent reserve engineers  and were calculated using oil and gas prices as of december  these prices will change and may be lower at the time of production than those prices that prevailed at the end of reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing wells  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material 
the discounted future net cash flows included in this document should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  increases or decreases in consumption  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  and which we use in calculating our pv  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our future revenues are dependent on the ability to successfully complete drilling activity 
drilling and exploration are the main methods we utilize to replace our reserves 
however  drilling and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including lack of acceptable prospective acreage  inadequate capital resources  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and gas prices  limitations in the market for oil and gas  title problems  compliance with governmental regulations  mechanical difficulties  and risks associated with horizontal drilling 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 
in addition  we recently completed drilling our sixth horizontal well in the cotton valley trend 
we have only limited experience drilling horizontal wells and there can be no assurance that this method of drilling will be as effective as we currently expect it to be 
in addition  while lower oil and gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  higher oil and gas prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs  equipment and crews and can lead to shortages of  and increasing costs for  such drilling equipment  services and personnel 
such shortages could restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned 
any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could adversely affect our ability to increase our reserves and production and reduce our revenues 
natural gas and oil prices are volatile  a sustained decrease in the price of natural gas or oil would adversely impact our business 
our success will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas 
these market prices tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions 
the general pace of global economic growth  the continued instability in the middle east and other oil and gas producing regions and actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  and its maintenance of production constraints  as well as other economic  political  and environmental factors will continue to affect world supply and prices 
domestic natural gas prices fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors including us economic conditions  weather patterns  other factors affecting demand such as substitute fuels  the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply  and the environmental and access issues that limit future drilling activities for the industry 

table of contents 
index to financial statements crude oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile 
average oil and natural gas prices decreased substantially during the year ended december  any additional actual or anticipated reduction in crude oil and natural gas prices may further depress the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
we expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the following table includes high and low natural gas prices price per mmbtu and crude oil prices west texas intermediate or wti for  as well as these prices at year end and at february  henry hub per mmbtu july  high december  low december  february  wti per barrel july  high december  low december  february  changes in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
prices for natural gas and crude oil declined sharply in the second half of and have remained low when compared with average prices in recent years 
these lower prices  coupled with the recent turmoil in financial markets that has significantly limited and increased the cost of capital  have compelled most natural gas and oil producers  including us  to reduce the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
this will have a significant effect on our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
any sustained reductions in natural gas and oil prices will directly affect our revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities 
further reductions in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable 
a reduction in our reserves could have other adverse consequences including a possible downward redetermination of the availability of borrowings under our senior credit facility  which would restrict our liquidity 
additionally  further or continued declines in prices could result in non cash charges to earnings due to impairment writedowns 
any such writedown could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
recent changes in the financial and credit markets may impact economic growth  and a sustained depression of oil and natural gas prices can also affect our ability to obtain funding  obtain funding on acceptable terms or obtain funding under our current credit facility 
this may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs 
we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed  and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available as needed  or is available only on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our development plan  enhance our existing business  complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions 
table of contents 
index to financial statements limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
we hedged approximately of our total production volumes for the year ended december  our results of operations may be negatively impacted by our commodity derivative instruments and fixed price forward sales contracts in the future and these instruments may limit any benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
for the years ended december  and we realized a loss on settled commodity derivatives of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we realized a gain on settled commodity derivatives of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized gain was combined with a million realized loss in resulting in a total unrealized and realized gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million for for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized loss on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized loss was combined with a million realized gain in resulting in a total unrealized and realized loss on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million for for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized gain was combined with a million realized loss in resulting in a total unrealized and realized gain on commodity derivative instruments not designated as hedges of million for this gain was recognized because the natural gas hedges were deemed ineffective for  and all previously effective oil hedges were deemed ineffective for the fourth quarter of we account for our commodity derivative contracts in accordance with sfas sfas requires each derivative to be recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability at its fair value 
additionally  the statement requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met at the time the derivative contract is executed 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting treatment to our swaps and collars and  as such  all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings 
our fixed price physical contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale exception 
contracts that qualify for this treatment do not require mark to market accounting treatment 
in the future  we will be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our hedges 
see note derivative activities to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
delays in development or production curtailment affecting our material properties may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
the size of our operations and our capital expenditure budget limits the number of wells that we can develop in any given year 
complications in the development of any single material well may result in a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a relatively small number of wells contribute a substantial portion of our production 
if we were to experience operational problems resulting in the curtailment of production in any of these wells  our total production levels would be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because our operations require significant capital expenditures  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves  maintain production or maintain interests in our properties 
we must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have paid for these expenditures with cash from 
table of contents 
index to financial statements operating activities  proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales 
our revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons 
if our revenues or cash flows decrease  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels 
if this occurs  our production will decline over time 
other sources of financing may not be available to us if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure requirements 
where we are not the majority owner or operator of an oil and gas property  we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the particular property 
if we cannot fund such capital expenditures  our interests in some properties may be reduced or forfeited 
if we are unable to replace reserves  we may not be able to sustain production at present levels 
our future success depends largely upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development  exploration or acquisition activities  our proved reserves will decline over time 
in addition  approximately of our total estimated proved reserves by volume at december   were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves and timing of their production are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the lack of availability of sufficient capital to fund such future operations could materially hinder or delay our replacement of produced reserves 
we may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 
we may incur substantial impairment writedowns 
if management s estimates of the recoverable reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and natural gas prices decline  we may be required to record additional non cash impairment writedowns in the future  which would result in a negative impact to our financial position 
furthermore  any sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments 
we review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions 
for each property determined to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairments from continuing operations related to oil and gas properties of million  million and million  respectively 
management s assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements a majority of our production  revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area 
approximately of our estimated proved reserves at december   and a similar percentage of our production during were associated with our cotton valley trend properties 
accordingly  if the level of production from these properties substantially declines or is otherwise subject to a disruption in our operations resulting from operational problems  government intervention or natural disasters  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue 
the results of our planned exploratory horizontal drilling in the haynesville shale  a newly emerging play with limited drilling and production history  are subject to more uncertainties than our drilling program in the more established shallower cotton valley formation and may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 
we have only recently participated in the drilling of our first four horizontal wells drilled in the haynesville shale 
production history from horizontal wells in the haynesville shale is limited due to the initial discovery occurring within the last months 
part of the drilling strategy to maximize recoveries from the drilling of horizontal wells in the haynesville shale is to use completion techniques involving extensive pressure stimulation and fracturing that have proven successful in other shale formations 
the ultimate success of our horizontal drilling and completion strategy and techniques in the formation will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established 
accordingly  the ultimate results of our future horizontal drilling in the haynesville shale over our acreage position are more uncertain than drilling results in the shallower cotton valley  where we have established reserves and production as a result of years of development 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
for example  chesapeake and matador resources company operate certain properties in the haynesville shale 
encana corporation and st 
mary land and exploration company operate certain properties in the cotton valley trend 
we have less ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them versus those fields in which we are the operator 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our reduced influence or ability to control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs 
our ability to sell natural gas and receive market prices for our gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions 
we operate primarily in the cotton valley trend  which is in the same geographic region as the recently discovered haynesville shale 
a number of companies are currently operating in the haynesville shale 
if drilling in the haynesville shale continues to be successful  the amount of natural gas being produced could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in this region 
if this occurs  it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built 
because of the current economic climate  certain pipeline projects that are planned for the cotton valley trend and haynesville shale region may not occur or may be substantially delayed for lack of financing 
in addition  capital constraints could limit our ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our gas to interstate pipelines 
in such event  we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on nymex or that we currently project  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
table of contents 
index to financial statements a portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for numerous reasons  including as a result of weather conditions  accidents  loss of pipeline or gathering system access  field labor issues or strikes  or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time  it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our senior credit facility and second lien term loan contain customary restrictions  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt  grant liens  make investments  consolidate  merge or acquire other businesses  sell assets  pay dividends and other distributions and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we also are required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility and second lien term loan 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the financial covenants of our senior credit facility and our second lien term loan 
these restrictions may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or to compete in our industry with companies not similarly restricted 
in addition  our current senior credit facility matures in february  any replacement credit facility may have more restrictive covenants or provide us with less borrowing capacity 
we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them 
the acquisition of properties requires us to assess a number of factors  including recoverable reserves  development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain 
in connection with the assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well  platform or pipeline 
we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems  such as pipeline corrosion  when an inspection is made 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities relating to the acquired assets and indemnities are unlikely to cover liabilities relating to the time periods after closing 
we may be required to assume any risk relating to the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
the incurrence of an unexpected liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
development  production and sale of natural gas and oil in the us are subject to extensive laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  bonds for ownership  development and production of oil and gas properties  reports concerning operations  and taxation 
in addition  our operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection 
governmental authorities enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  which can result in an obligation to undertake difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws  regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our business 
the imposition of joint and several and strict liabilities is common in environmental laws and may result in us incurring costs in connection with discharges or releases of hydrocarbons and wastes due to our handling of hydrocarbons and wastes  the release of air emissions or water discharges in connection with our operations  and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices conducted by us or predecessor operators on  under or from our properties and from facilities where our wastes have been taken for disposal 
private parties affected by such discharges or releases may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as seek damages for personal injury or property damage 
in addition  changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions 
we also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can 
our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
our success depends on our management team and other key personnel  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations 
our success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professional staff 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts  technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team 
if a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be adversely affected 
terrorist attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations 
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities particularly in the middle east may have on the energy industry in general  and on us in particular  is unknown 
uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  particularly oil  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war 
moreover  we have incurred additional costs since the terrorist attacks of september  to safeguard certain of our assets and we may be required to incur significant additional costs in the future 
the terrorist attacks on september   and the changes in the insurance markets attributable to such attacks have made certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to us without significant additional costs 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital 
the oil and gas business involves many uncertainties  economic risks and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  
table of contents 
index to financial statements releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
any of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
as a result  substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred 
the payment of these amounts could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions 
these reductions in funds could result in a loss of our properties 
additionally  some of our oil and gas operations are located in areas that are subject to weather disturbances such as hurricanes 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of such risks and losses 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities 
we maintain general and excess liability policies  which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards 
these policies generally cover personal injury  bodily injury  third party property damage  medical expenses  legal defense costs  pollution in some cases  well blowouts in some cases  and workers compensation 
as is common in the oil and natural gas industry  we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive 
a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover every claim made against us in the future 
a loss in connection with our oil and natural gas properties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations to the extent that the insurance coverage provided under our policies cover only a portion of any such loss 
title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects 
we generally obtain title opinions on significant properties that we drill or acquire 
however  there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure 
additionally  undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage 
generally  under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties  any monetary loss is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property 
if there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest  we will suffer a financial loss 
our large inventory of undeveloped acreage and large percentage of undeveloped proved reserves may create additional economic risk 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to develop our large inventory of future drilling locations  undeveloped acreage and undeveloped reserves in our resource style plays in texas and louisiana 
as of december  approximately of our total proved reserves were undeveloped 
to the extent our drilling results are not as successful as we anticipate  natural gas and oil prices decline  or sufficient funds are not

there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks

overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  exploitation  development and production of oil and natural gas properties primarily in the cotton valley trend of east texas and northwest louisiana  including the recently discovered haynesville shale play in the same general area 
we operate as one segment as each of our operating areas have similar economic characteristics and each meet the criteria for aggregation as defined in the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we seek to increase shareholder value by growing our oil and gas reserves  production revenues and operating cash flow 
in our opinion  on a long term basis  growth in oil and gas reserves and production on a cost effective basis are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and gas company 
management strives to increase our oil and gas reserves  production and cash flow through exploration and exploitation activities 
we develop an annual capital expenditure budget which is reviewed and approved by our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements board of directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant 
we take into consideration our projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing  such as bank debt  when establishing our capital expenditure budget 
we place primary emphasis on our internally generated operating cash flow in managing our business 
for this purpose  operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities as reflected in our statement of cash flows 
management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of our financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income because operating cash flow considers only the cash expenses incurred during the period and excludes the non cash impact of unrealized hedging gains and losses 
our revenues and operating cash flow are dependent on the successful development of our inventory of capital projects with available capital  the volume and timing of our production  as well as commodity prices for oil and gas 
such pricing factors are largely beyond our control  however  we employ commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on our earnings and operating cash flow 
cotton valley trend our relatively low risk development drilling program in the cotton valley trend is primarily centered in and around rusk  panola  angelina  nacogdoches  cherokee  harrison  smith and upshur counties  texas and desoto and caddo parishes  louisiana 
we continue to build our acreage position in the cotton valley trend and hold  gross acres as of december  as of year end  we drilled and completed a cumulative total of cotton valley trend wells with a success rate in excess of 
our net production volumes from our cotton valley trend wells aggregated approximately  mcfe per day in  or approximately of our total oil and gas production for the year 
haynesville shale transactions chesapeake haynesville joint development on june   we entered into a joint development agreement with chesapeake energy corporation  or chesapeake  to develop our haynesville shale acreage in the bethany longstreet and longwood fields of caddo and desoto parishes  louisiana 
chesapeake purchased the deep rights  including the haynesville shale  to approximately  net acres of oil and natural gas leasehold comprised of a working interest in approximately  net acres in the bethany longstreet field and a working interest in approximately  net acres in the longwood field for net proceeds of million 
chesapeake also purchased  net acres of deep rights in the bethany longstreet field from a third party see note related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements  bringing the ownership interest in the deep rights in both fields after closing to each for us and chesapeake 
chesapeake is the operator of the joint haynesville shale development 
as a result of this transaction  we hold approximately  gross  net acres in the deep rights in the bethany longstreet field and approximately  gross  net acres in the deep rights in the longwood field  both of which are currently believed to be prospective for the haynesville shale 
through our joint development arrangement with chesapeake  we will continue to operate existing production and operate any new wells drilled to the base of the cotton valley sand  and chesapeake will operate any wells drilled below the base of the cotton valley sand  including the haynesville shale 
we retained the shallow rights to the base of the cotton valley sand and the existing production and reserves with respect to our working interest in the bethany longstreet field and our working interest in the longwood field 
we also retained our interest in both the shallow and haynesville shale rights on all of our east texas assets 
during the third quarter of  chesapeake began drilling the holland h no 
as the first horizontal well on the joint acreage in bethany longstreet field

during the fourth quarter of  completion operations began on both of these wells and two horizontal haynesville shale development wells were spud in bethany longstreet field together with two haynesville shale wells in longwood field 
in  we and chesapeake plan to use approximately three rigs most of the year to drill gross joint wells 
caddo parish acquisition on may   we acquired additional interests in the cotton valley trend  increasing our net exposure in the haynesville shale 
we acquired approximately  net acres in longwood field of caddo parish  louisiana  through the issuance of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
the purchase included interests in gross wells  with approximately mmcfe per day of net production  and bcfe of proved reserves developed associated with the shallower hosston and cotton valley formations 
as of december   we had drilled and participated in three haynesville wells 
caddo pine island acquisition on june   we entered into a definitive agreement with a private company for the right to acquire over time a non operated interest in  gross  net acres in the caddo pine island field  north of and adjacent to our longwood field in caddo parish  louisiana 
total consideration paid was approximately million  which was comprised of acreage costs for the interest in the leasehold and the cost of a carried interest on the initial well drilled on the acreage 
as of december   four wells had been drilled vertically to the haynesville shale on this acreage 
in the fourth quarter of  we re entered two of these wells to drill them horizontally in the haynesville shale formation 
completion of the first horizontal well will start in the first quarter of and we expect to complete the other wells in the second quarter of in  we plan to drill two additional horizontal haynesville shale wells on the acreage 
in connection with the chesapeake joint development agreement  the caddo parish acquisition and the caddo pine island acquisition  we have a total of approximately  net acres in north louisiana which we believe to be prospective for the haynesville shale formation 
initial company operated haynesville shale drilling program as of december   we have been the operator on and drilled four vertical wells on our north louisiana acreage and seven wells on our east texas acreage  for a total of eleven vertical wells targeting the haynesville shale 
in the fourth quarter of  we began drilling our first operated horizontal haynesville shale well 
we expect to complete this well in the first quarter of we expect that our development of the haynesville shale will continue in with the drilling and completion of nine company operated horizontal wells in east texas 
sale of south louisiana assets on march   we completed the sale of substantially all of our assets in south louisiana to a private company 
the sale resulted in total proceeds of million  net to us  after normal closing adjustments 
we recognized a gain of million net of tax in the effective date of the sale was july  on august   we closed the sale of the st 
gabriel field to a private party for million  resulting in a gain of million 
on august   we assigned our rights in the bayou bouillon field to a private party for a nominal amount

this compares to a net loss applicable to common stock of million  or per share basic and diluted for the year ended december   and a net loss applicable to common stock of million  or per share basic and diluted for the year ended december  some highlights for the year ended december  include we recorded a million gain on the sale of assets in a sale that closed in july this gain includes million from the sale of a portion of our interest in the haynesville shale deep rights to chesapeake 
in conjunction with the decline in natural gas prices during late  we recorded a million gain on derivatives not designated as hedges for the year ended december  this includes a realized loss of million and an unrealized gain of million for our natural gas commodity contracts and a realized loss of million and an unrealized loss of million on our interest rate swaps 
our income tax expense for the year was reduced by a million decrease in our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
we released a majority of our valuation allowance in the third quarter of upon closing and recognizing a significant gain on the chesapeake sale 
operating income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues from continuing operations increased compared to  to a total of million in due to a increase in production and a increase in the average realized price 
production increased year to year from  mmcfe to  mmcfe and our average realized price increased from per mcfe to per mcfe 
the drilling and completion of wells in the cotton valley trend resulted in the continued natural gas production growth for the company  even though we estimate we curtailed approximately mmcfe of natural gas production in september as a result of hurricane ike 
operating expenses of million for the year ended december   include the million gain on sale of assets as a reduction in operating expenses and impairment expense of million 
excluding the gain on sales of assets for and impairment expense for both and  operating expenses of million increased or million over operating expenses of million not including million of impairment expense 
this increase is a direct result of increased production from year to year 
although revenues were up significantly for the full year  we experienced a substantial reduction in revenues in the last half of versus the first half of the year  due to the substantial oil and natural gas price declines 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues increased  or million  compared to  to a total of million in due to production increases and a slight increase in average realized price per mcfe 
production increased year to year from  mmcfe to  mmcfe and our average realized price increased from mcfe to per mcfe 
the drilling and completion of wells in the cotton valley trend led to the gains in natural gas production for operating expenses increased to million in the primary driver behind the million increase in operating expenses was a million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a year to year

both of these cost areas were relatively flat on a per mcfe basis 
non op loe also increased million million or per mcfe for versus million or per mcfe for due to a greater number of our properties being operated by others

we only accrue for such credits once we have been notified of the state s approval 
we also anticipate lower production tax rates in the future as we continue to add cotton valley trend wells to our production base and as credits are approved 
production taxes are higher for as the result of a increase in production over  as well as the higher prices received during the year

the combination of these two factors led to the increase in ad valorem taxes year to year 
transportation expense was million in compared to million for as production volumes increased year over year 
the unit cost increased nine percent from per mcfe in to per mcfe in due to an increase in production rates from fields requiring greater transportation  and due to several contracts entered into which transported gas to higher valued markets 
dd a expense increased to million in from million for primarily due to a higher dd a rate coupled with higher levels of production 
since we use the successful efforts method of accounting  our dd a rate is primarily a function of our capitalized drilling  completion and facilities costs divided by our proved developed reserves 
beginning in late early we embarked on an aggressive drilling program to fully develop our extensive east texas north louisiana cotton valley trend acreage position during a period of record high costs for drilling and completion services 
additionally  to hold the majority of our acreage and thereby allow for the most prudent development plan going forward  we chose to drill many wells in the outlying areas of our acreage block  where per well results were less certain than in the initial established areas 
finally  many of our initial wells in certain fields required us to pay the costs of other industry partners to earn access to the full acreage position 
we calculated first and second quarter dd a rates using the december  reserves  which did not recognize any impact of our cotton valley trend drilling program reserve additions

this mid year reserve report was used to calculate rates for the third and fourth quarters of as mentioned above  the dd a rate per mcfe based on this report was  which was lower than the rate used for the first half of this year primarily due to the inclusion of more wells drilled in our core areas during the first half of this year relative to the mix of wells in the december  reserve report

disruptions in the credit and capital markets and impact on liquidity we have historically funded our operations from a combination of borrowings under our bank facilities  accessing the capital markets and cash flow from operations 
there have been significant disruptions in the us and global credit and capital markets 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers 
we believe that with prices as of december   we can fund up to million of capital expenditures in from available cash and cash flow from operations without borrowing under our senior credit facility 
we have approximately million of cash on hand and million of undrawn capacity available under our senior credit facility that matures in february availability under our credit facility is subject to semi annual borrowing base redeterminations  set at the discretion of our lenders 
both we and our lenders also have the discretion to call for at least one additional redetermination per year 
the borrowing base is calculated by our lenders based on their valuation of our proved reserves utilizing our reserve reports and their internal decisions 
there is no assurance that we can sustain or increase our borrowing base  which if reduced will reduce our borrowing capacity 
because we control the timing of a substantial portion of our capital expenditures and will manage such expenditures accordingly  we do not anticipate an immediate need for borrowings under our senior credit facility or access to the capital markets for the duration of accordingly  we may adjust our capital budget further based on further evaluations of our available funding  the status of our drilling operations and the outlook for oil and natural gas prices 
as our senior credit facility is set to expire in february  we are planning to explore refinancing alternatives in the near future 
given the current state of the bank markets  there can be no assurance that a replacement facility will provide similar borrowing capacity  nor do we expect to replace the facility without paying materially higher fees and higher rates on drawn borrowings

index to financial statements the capped call option transactions are expected to result in our receipt  on a net share  cashless basis of a certain number of shares of our common stock if the market value per share of the common stock  as measured under the terms of the capped call option agreements  on the option expiration date for the relevant tranche is greater than the lower call strike price of the capped call option transactions 
we refer to the amount by which the market value per share exceeds the lower call strike price as an in the money amount for the relevant tranche of the capped call option transaction 
the in the money amount will never exceed the difference between the upper call strike price and the lower call strike price ie  it will be capped 
the lower call strike price is  which corresponds to the price to the public in the equity offering and the upper call strike price is  which corresponds to of the price to the public in the offering 
both lower and upper call strike prices are subject to customary anti dilution and certain other adjustments 
the number of shares of our common stock that we will receive from the option counterparties upon expiration of each tranche of the capped call option transactions will be equal to the in the money amount of that tranche divided by the market value per share of the common stock  as measured under the terms of the capped call option agreements  on the option expiration date for that tranche 
if the stock price is equal to the upper call strike price of on each of the settlement dates  we will recoup up to million shares 
the capped call option agreements were separate transactions entered into by us with the option counterparties and were not part of the terms of the offering of common stock 
the capped call option agreements require an option counterparty to transfer their rights and obligations within days if their credit rating is below either baa by moody s or bbb by s p 
as a result of the ratings downgrade of bsc on march   bsc was obligated to transfer their rights and obligations under the capped call option agreement to a suitable counterparty one with a credit rating of at least bbb by s p and baa by moody s within days 
bsc s obligation to transfer its rights and obligations to an entity with a higher credit rating was cured by a ratings upgrade on march  during the second quarter of  bsc sold its position in the capped call options to bank of america

summary of critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list in note description of business and significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us 
we cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting we use the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures and to calculate dd a 
unsuccessful exploration wells  as well as other exploration expenditures such as seismic costs  are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by engineers 
certain costs related to fields or areas that are not fully developed are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved oil and natural gas reserves 
impairment of properties we continually monitor our long lived assets recorded in oil and gas properties in the consolidated balance sheets to ensure that they are fairly presented 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
performing these evaluations requires a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable proved and probable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
we cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 

table of contents 
index to financial statements asset retirement obligations we are required to make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and gas properties 
this requirement necessitates us to make estimates of our property abandonment costs that  in some cases  will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future 
such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements  technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict 
income taxes we are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us 
we periodically evaluate our tax operating loss and other carryforwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset  as well as a related valuation allowance  should be recognized in our financial statements 
in july  we realized a significant gain on sale of assets which helped generate income from continuing operations before taxes of million for as a result of the significant gain generated by the sale  we believe that we will be in a position to utilize the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards when we file our tax return 
we believe it is now more likely than not that we will be able to recognize our deferred tax assets associated with these net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  we released million of our previously booked valuation allowance in the third quarter of this year 
fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  provides guidance on recognition and measurement of uncertainties in income taxes 
fin requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement derivative instruments are carried at fair value 
recurring fair value measurements at interim periods and annually use quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means 
these measurements fall within level of the fair value hierarchy of sfas share based compensation plans for all new  modified and unvested share based payment transactions with employees  we measure at fair value and recognize as compensation expense over the requisite period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model that requires us to develop estimates for assumptions used in the model 
the black scholes valuation model uses the following assumptions expected volatility  expected term of option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
expected volatility estimates are developed by us based on historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the grant date 
our common stock does not pay dividends  therefore the dividend yield is zero

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk despite the measures taken by us to attempt to control price risk  we remain subject to price fluctuations for natural gas and crude oil sold in the spot market 
prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond our control 
domestic crude oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
we enter into futures contracts or other hedging agreements from time to time to manage the commodity price risk for a portion of our production 
we consider these agreements to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are reflected in our crude oil and natural gas sales 
our strategy  which is administered by the hedging committee of the board of directors  and reviewed periodically by the entire board of directors  has been to generally hedge between and of our production 
as of december   the commodity hedges we use were in the form of a swaps  where we receive a fixed price and pay a floating price  based on nymex and field prices  and b collars  where we receive the excess  if any  of the floor price over the reference price  based on nymex quoted prices  and pay the excess  if any  of the reference price over the ceiling price

based on gas pricing in effect at december   a hypothetical increase in gas prices would have resulted in a current derivative asset of million while a hypothetical decrease in gas prices would have increased the current derivative asset to million 
we have entered into the following contracts subsequent to december  a a ngpltxok priced basis swap contract with the bank of montreal for  mmbtu per day for the months of march through december  locking in a fixed basis to the company of per mmbtu  and b a ngpltxok priced basis swap contract with bnp for  mmbtu per day for the months of march through december locking in a fixed basis to the company of per mmbtu 
interest rate risk we have a variable rate debt obligation that exposes us to the effects of changes in interest rates 
to partially reduce our exposure to interest rate risk  from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we had the following interest rate swaps in place with bnp and bmo in millions effective date maturity date libor swap rate notional amount millions fair value dollars the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts in place at december   resulted in a current liability of million and a long term liability of million
