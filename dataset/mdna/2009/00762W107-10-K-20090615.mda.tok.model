our membership business model allows us to focus on a broad set of issues relevant to our member organizations  while promoting frequent use of our programs and services by our members 
our growth has been driven by strong renewal rates  ongoing addition of new memberships in our existing programs  continued annual price increases  and continued new program launches 
our member institution renewal rate in each of the past three years was   and for fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
we believe high renewal rates are a reflection of our members recognition of the value they derive from participating in our programs 
our revenue grew in fiscal over fiscal and grew in fiscal over fiscal our contract value remained constant at march  when compared to march  and increased by at march  over march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
memberships in of our programs are renewable at the end of their membership contract term 
our other eight best practices programs provide installation support 
these installation support program memberships help participants accelerate the adoption of best practices profiled in our research studies  and are therefore not individually renewable 
as of march   approximately of our contract value was renewable

net income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal the increase in net income during fiscal was primarily due to profitable growth as revenue for the period increased more than  compared to expense increases of  allowing us to leverage our existing costs over our expanding membership base and to invest in new program launches 
the decrease in net income during fiscal was primarily due to lower revenue growth of  compared to expense growth of due to increases in costs to serve members  costs associated with the launch of new programs  and an increase in the number of new sales teams

in addition  in fiscal year  we incurred additional costs from the integration of crimson software  inc crimson into our operations  as well as increased contractor costs and licensing fees related to certain of our programs that include business intelligence tools 
stock based compensation expense included in cost of services was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  cost of services was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal cost of services decreased as a percentage of revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a shift in timing of new product staffing costs between the first quarter of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from the earlier launch of new programs 
the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the factors listed in the paragraph above  as well as the impact of slower revenue growth on our fixed cost structure 
we expect cost of services as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate from period to period  depending on the number of members in our largely fixed cost programs  investments in new programs and services  and the number of new programs launched as up front costs are expensed when incurred compared to revenue  which is spread over the membership period

in addition to stock based compensation expense  the increases in general and administrative expense for each of the fiscal years were primarily due to increased staffing in our recruiting  benefits  and training departments required to support our overall headcount growth 
general and administrative expenses increased at a lower rate than revenue between fiscal and as we were able to leverage these expenses over a larger revenue base 
general and administrative expense increased at the same rate as revenue between fiscal and fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal  to million  or of revenue  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenue  in fiscal the increases for each of the fiscal years were primarily due to increased amortization expense from developed capitalized internal use software tools  including acquired developed technology associated with the acquisition of crimson  and depreciation expense related to the expansion of additional floors in our headquarters facility under the terms of our lease agreement

we are also required to maintain an interest coverage ratio for each of our fiscal years of not less than three to one 
the credit facility renews automatically each year until  and can be increased at our request by up to an additional million per year up to million in the aggregate 
there have been no borrowings under the credit facility 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
these obligations relate primarily to our headquarters and other offices leases  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and payments related to our acquisition of crimson  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands total yrs non cancelable operating leases milestone payments relating to acquisition of crimson in connection with the acquisition of crimson  we are required to pay up to million of additional cash payments that will become due and payable if certain milestones are met over the evaluation period beginning at the acquisition date through march  the company paid million in cash for achievement of some of these milestones in the fiscal year ended march  as of march   the estimated remaining balance of these cash payments was approximately million

we also incurred additional compensation deductions for tax reporting purposes  but not for financial reporting purposes  that increased the deferred tax asset to reflect allowable tax deductions 
these tax deductions will be realized in the determination of our income tax liability and therefore reduce our future income tax payments 
in connection with these transactions  our deferred tax asset increased by approximately million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
although the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes did not change  our actual cash payments will be reduced as the deferred tax asset is utilized 
summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our members  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and collectability is reasonably assured 
fees are generally billable when a letter of agreement is signed by the member  and fees receivable during the subsequent twelve month period and related deferred revenue are recorded upon the commencement of the agreement or collection of fees  if earlier 
certain fees are billed on an installment basis 
members whose membership agreements are subject to the service guarantee may request a refund of their fees  which is provided on a pro rata basis relative to the length of the service period 
revenue from renewable memberships and best practices installation support memberships is recognized ratably over the term of the related subscription agreement 
certain membership programs incorporate robust hosted business intelligence tools 
in many of these agreements  members are charged set up fees in addition to subscription fees for access to the hosted web based business intelligence tools and related membership services 
both set up fees and subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the membership agreement  which is generally one to three years 
upon launch of a new program that incorporates a robust business intelligence tool  all program revenue is deferred until the tool is generally available for release to our membership  and then recognized ratably over the remainder of the contract term of each agreement 
one of our programs includes delivered software tools together with implementation services  technical support  and related membership services 
revenue for these arrangements is recorded pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we separate the fair value of the technical support and related membership services from the total value of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the fees related to the software license and implementation services are bundled and recognized in conformity with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  as services are performed using project hours as the basis to measure progress towards completion 
fees associated with the technical support and related membership services are recorded as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  beginning when all other elements have been delivered 
allowance for uncollectible revenue the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from its members has an effect on the company s operating performance and cash flows 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on its ongoing monitoring of members credit and the aging of receivables 
to determine the allowance for uncollectible revenue  the company examines its collections history  the age of accounts receivable in question  any specific member collection issues that have been identified  general market conditions  and current economic trends 
capitalized internal software development costs hosted software internal use 
in certain membership programs  the company provides business intelligence software tools under a hosting arrangement where the software application resides on the company s or its service providers hardware 
the customers do not take delivery of the software and only receive access to the business intelligence tools during the term of their membership agreement 
in accordance with eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware eitf  the development costs of this software are accounted for in accordance with sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
computer software development costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred 
during the development stage  direct consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees that are directly associated with each project are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software once placed into operation 
delivered software 
one of our membership programs includes delivered software tools 
the associated capitalized software asset is accounted for in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly related to building a software product once technological feasibility is established 
we determine technological feasibility is established by the completion of a detail program design or  in its absence  completion of a working model 
once the software product is ready for general availability  we cease capitalizing costs and begin amortizing the intangible asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s goodwill and other intangible assets have been accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
accordingly  upon completion of an acquisition  the purchase price is allocated to the intangibles which are separately identifiable from goodwill based on the assets fair value 
the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
fas requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather be tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
recovery of long lived assets excluding goodwill the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets fas  which requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the test for recoverability is made using an estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash flows and  if required  the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value if the asset is not recoverable 
the company considers expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends  and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
deferred incentive compensation and other charges direct incentive compensation to our employees related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships  license fees to third party vendors for tools  data  and software incorporated in specific memberships that include business intelligence tools  and other direct and incremental costs associated with specific memberships are deferred and amortized over the term of the related memberships 
deferred tax asset recoverability we have deferred income taxes consisting primarily of timing differences and federal and state income tax credits 
in estimating future tax consequences  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  generally considers all expected future events in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we believe that our future taxable income will be sufficient for the full realization of the deferred income taxes 
fas does not consider the effect of future changes in existing tax laws or rates in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities until the new tax laws or rates are enacted 
we have established our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax laws and rates  including the estimated effects of the qhtc status on our washington  dc deferred tax assets 
we will recognize an adjustment to income for the impact of new tax laws or rates on the existing deferred tax assets and liabilities  if any  when and if new tax laws or rates are enacted 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin on april  the impact of adoption was not material 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fas fin prescribes that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured as the largest amount of the tax benefits  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the provision for income taxes 
we do not currently anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase within the next months 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the stock based awards based on their fair values  and is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting periods of the awards 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized by us beginning april  included a compensation cost for all stock based payments granted on or after april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r  and b compensation cost for all stock based payments granted prior to  but that were unvested as of  april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
under the provisions of fas r  the company calculates the grant date estimated fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
determining the estimated fair value of stock based awards is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including the term of the stock based awards  risk free interest rates over the vesting period  expected dividend rates  the price volatility of the company s shares  and forfeiture rates of the awards 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and adjusted  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain 
the fair value of rsus is determined as the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
in accordance with fas r  we also report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense as a financing cash inflow in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
as of march   our marketable securities consisted of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by the district of columbia  million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by various states  and million in us government agency securities 
the weighted average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to the cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
our portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material 
with respect to recent global economic events  there is an unprecedented uncertainty in the financial markets  which could bring potential liquidity risks to the company 
such risks could include additional declines in our stock value  less availability and higher costs of additional credit  potential counterparty defaults  and further commercial bank failures 
the company does not believe that the value or liquidity of its cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  as described above  have been significantly impacted by the recent credit crisis 
in addition  the credit worthiness of our members is constantly monitored by the company and we believe that our current group of members are sound and represent no abnormal business risk 
foreign currency risk 
although it represents less than of our revenue  our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations 
prices for our services sold to members located outside the united states are sometimes denominated in local currencies 
as a consequence  increases in the us dollar against local currencies in countries where we have members would result in a foreign exchange loss recognized by the company 
in and  we recorded foreign currency exchange losses of zero and million  respectively  which is included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of income
