item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  estimates and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed in this report under risk factors 
overview we design  manufacture and sell high performance memory subsystems for the server  high performance computing and communications markets 
our memory subsystems consist of dynamic random access memory integrated circuits  or dram ics  nand flash memory  or nand  and other components assembled on a printed circuit board  or pcb 
we engage with our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers from the earliest stages of new product definition  which provides us unique insight into their full range of system architecture and performance requirements 
this close collaboration has also allowed us to develop a significant level of systems expertise 
we leverage a portfolio of proprietary technologies and design techniques  including efficient planar design  alternative packaging techniques and custom semiconductor logic  to deliver memory subsystems with high memory density  small form factor  high signal integrity  attractive thermal characteristics and low cost per bit 
due to their importance to overall system architecture and performance  our products must undergo lengthy qualification reviews by our oem customers  which may last up to six months or more 
in addition  in order to establish large oem customers  we have typically been required to demonstrate our ability to meet strict standards for quality  customer service and turnaround time by first supplying less complex products into a limited range of high volume applications 
consistent with the concentrated nature of the oem customer base in our target markets  a small number of large customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales 
dell and hewlett packard represented approximately and  respectively of our net sales in fiscal and approximately and  respectively  of our net sales in fiscal net sales to some of our oem customers include memory modules that are qualified by us directly with the oem customer and sold to electronic manufacturing services providers  or emss  for incorporation into products manufactured exclusively for the oem customer 
these net sales to emss have historically fluctuated period by period as a portion of the total net sales to these oem customers 
net sales to hon hai precision industry co 
ltd  an ems that purchases memory modules from us for incorporation into products manufactured exclusively for dell  represented approximately of our net sales to dell for fiscal and approximately of our net sales to dell for fiscal key business metrics the following describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations that are important to management s assessment of our financial performance net sales 
net sales consist primarily of sales of our high performance memory subsystems  net of a provision for estimated returns under our right of return policies  which generally range up to days 
we generally do not have long term sales agreements with our customers 
although oem customers typically provide us with non binding forecasts of future product demand over specific periods of time  they generally place orders with us approximately two weeks in advance of scheduled delivery 
selling prices are typically negotiated monthly  based on competitive market conditions and the current price of dram ics and nand 
purchase orders generally have no cancellation or rescheduling penalty provisions 
we often ship our products to our customers international manufacturing sites 
all of our sales to date  however  are denominated in united states  or us  
table of contents dollars 
we also sell excess component inventory of dram ics and nand to distributors and other users of memory ics 
as compared to previous years  component inventory sales have significantly decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of our efforts to diversify both our customer and product line bases 
this diversification effort has also allowed us to use components in a wider range of memory subsystems 
we expect that component inventory sales will continue to represent a minimal portion of our net sales in future periods 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of materials  manufacturing costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment  inventory valuation provisions  stock based compensation and occupancy costs and other allocated fixed costs 
the dram ics and nand incorporated into our products constitute a significant portion of our cost of sales  and thus our cost of sales will fluctuate based on the current price of dram ics and nand 
we attempt to pass through such dram ic and nand flash memory cost fluctuations to our customers by frequently renegotiating pricing prior to the placement of their purchase orders 
to the extent we are successful  a large majority of our product cost is variable  and thus our cost of sales and gross margin percentages may not be significantly impacted by changes in sales volume 
however  the sales prices of our memory subsystems can also fluctuate due to competitive situations unrelated to the pricing of dram ics and nand  which affects gross margins 
the gross margin on our sales of excess component dram ic and nand inventory is much lower than the gross margin on our sales of our memory subsystems 
as a result  a decrease in dram ic and nand inventory sales as a percentage of our overall sales could result in an improved overall gross margin 
we assess the valuation of our inventories on a monthly basis and record a provision to cost of sales as necessary to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of employee and independent contractor compensation and related costs  stock based compensation  computer aided design software licenses  reference design development costs  patent related fees  depreciation or rental of evaluation equipment  and occupancy and other allocated overhead costs 
also included in research and development expense are the costs of material and overhead related to the production of engineering samples of new products under development or products used solely in the research and development process 
our customers typically do not separately compensate us for design and engineering work involved in developing application specific products for them 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we anticipate that research and development expenditures will increase in future periods as we seek to expand new product opportunities  increase our activities related to new and emerging markets and continue to develop additional proprietary technologies 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related costs  stock based compensation  independent sales representative commissions  professional services  promotional and other selling and marketing expenses  and occupancy and other allocated overhead costs 
a significant portion of our selling efforts is directed at building relationships with oems and other customers and working through the product approval and qualification process with them 
therefore  the cost of material and overhead related to products manufactured for qualification is included in selling expenses 
as we continue to service existing and establish new customers  we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase 
beginning in fiscal  we anticipate being subject to attestation services requirements with respect to our internal control over financial reporting  the result of which will increase legal and accounting expenses in future periods 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the federal statutory rate was for fiscal and the company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the establishment of a partial valuation allowance during fiscal as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report which caused us to record a provision for income 
table of contents taxes for the year ended january  as compared to recording a benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may result in material adverse effects on our operating results and financial position 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab under the provisions of sab  we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  product delivery and acceptance have occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders and or contracts as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped for customers with fob shipping point terms and upon receipt for customers with fob destination terms  at which time title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery and customer acceptance 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund 
customers are generally allowed limited rights of return for up to days  except for sales of excess inventories  which contain no right of return privileges 
estimated returns are provided for at the time of sale based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 
we offer a standard product warranty to our customers and have no other post shipment obligations 
while these returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience similar return rates in the future 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting product returns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and evaluations  as well as the customer s payment history 
a portion of our shipments are made to third party inventory warehouses  or hubs  and we recognize revenue when the inventory is pulled from the hub for use in production by the customer 
we receive a report from the customer on a daily basis indicating the inventories pulled from a hub for use by the customer  and perform a daily reconciliation of inventories shipped to and pulled by the customer to those inventories reflected on the customer s reports to ensure that sales are recognized in the appropriate periods 
we have historically had good visibility into the inventories on hand at hub locations and also what our customers intend to pull within each reporting period 
however  if a customer does not pull our inventory from its hub in accordance with the schedule it originally provided to us  our predicted future revenues could vary from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  since we own inventories that are physically located in hubs  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  causing our inventory turns to decrease  which would increase expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventories and negatively impact our cash flow 

table of contents all amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as net sales  while all costs incurred by us for shipping and handling are classified as cost of sales 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses and debt instruments 
effective december   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements 
pursuant to sfas  other than for certain investments in auction rate securities see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the fair value of the company s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities is determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  or level inputs 
we believe that the carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values due to their nature and respective durations 
warranty reserve 
we offer warranties on our memory subsystems generally ranging from one to three years  depending on the product and negotiated terms of purchase agreements with our customers 
such warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
our estimates for warranty related costs are recorded at the time of sale based on historical and estimated future product return rates and expected repair or replacement costs 
while such costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  unexpected changes in failure rates could have a material adverse impact on us  requiring additional warranty reserves  and adversely affecting our gross profit and gross margins 
accounts receivable 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended to our customers as deemed necessary  but generally require no collateral 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
generally  these credit losses have been within our expectations and the provisions established 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience credit loss rates similar to those we have experienced in the past 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated among a small number of customers  and a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the net realizable value of the inventory 
cost is determined on an average cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and includes raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next three to six months 
in addition  we consider changes in the market value of dram ics and nand in determining the net realizable value of our raw material inventory 
once established  any write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of our inventories 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of sales in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time such inventories are sold 
in addition  should the market value of dram ics or 
table of contents nand decrease significantly  we may be required to lower our selling prices to reflect the lower cost of our raw materials 
if such price decreases reduce the net realizable value of our inventories to less than our cost  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of sales in the same period 
although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological developments or the market value of dram ics or nand could have a material effect on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
long lived assets 
we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  utilizing our best estimates  appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
these projected future cash flows may vary significantly over time as a result of increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset 
stock based compensation 
we account for equity issuances to non employees in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods and services 
all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the third party performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our common stock option awards 
while this model meets the requirements of sfas r  the estimated fair values generated by it may not be indicative of the actual fair values of these awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the black scholes model requires subjective assumptions regarding future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  along with assumptions about the risk free interest rate and expected dividends  all of which affect the estimated fair values of our common stock option awards 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies based on our belief that we currently have limited historical data regarding the volatility of our stock price on which to base a meaningful estimate of expected volatility 
the risk free rate selected to value any particular grant is based on the us treasury rate that corresponds to the expected term of the grant effective as of the date of the grant 
the expected dividends assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our common stock option awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in prior periods 
the value of the portion of stock based awards that are ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our financial statements 
given that stock based 
table of contents compensation expense recognized in our financial statements is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional common stock options or other stock based awards 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  when determined necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we operate at a loss for an extended period of time or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets which could substantially increase our effective tax rate for such period 
any significant changes in statutory tax rates or the amount of our valuation allowance could have a material effect on the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our reported financial results 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  on december   the first day of our fiscal fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement recognition of a tax position that has been taken or is expected to be taken on a tax return and also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
under fin we may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities

the overall decrease in our net sales during the year ended january  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily driven by the slower than expected growth in sales of certain of our flash and high density server modules  as well as a decline in net sales of memory subsystems used to control redundant arrays of independent disks  or raids  as a result of certain key programs and designs nearing an end of life in additionally  our net sales were adversely affected to a lesser extent by the fact that during the second half of the market price of mainstream dram ic s decreased by approximately  which affected the selling prices of certain of our products 
the decrease in our net sales during the current year was partially offset  however  by strong growth in our line of low power fully buffered dual in line memory modules  or fbdimms  which experienced a significant ramp in sales volume to certain key oem customers beginning in 
table of contents the decrease in net sales for the year ended january  as compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from decreases of i million in sales of laptop personal computer memory subsystems  and ii million in sales of memory systems used to control redundant arrays of independent disks  or raids  and iii million in sales of other memory products  primarily with respect to certain of our upgrade and distribution business customers that were affected by the overall downward market in and these decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales for as compared to of i million in sales of server related products and ii million of flash memory products 
should market price declines for dram ics or nand continue  our net sales could be adversely impacted in future periods as we lower prices on some products to meet market conditions 
sales of our component inventory to distributors and other users of memory ics represented approximately and of net sales for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
as compared to previous years  component inventory sales have significantly decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of our efforts to use similar components in a wider range of memory subsystems 
gross profit and gross margin 
gross profit for the year ended january  as compared to the year ended december  decreased primarily due to the decrease in net sales between the two years 
declines in product gross profits were partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs due to the shift in production to our facility in suzhou in the people s republic of china  or prc  as well as better supply chain and inventory management during the year 
the declines in both gross profit and gross margin in were partially due to certain shifts in product mix that provided lower margin contributions 
to the extent that dram ic market prices continue to decline  or should our product sales mix continue to be weighted with lower margin products such as laptop memory  our gross profit  gross margin and overall operating results could be adversely affected in future periods 
research and development the following table presents research and development expenses for the years ended january  and december  in thousands  except percentages year ended january  december  increase change research and development the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended january  as compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from increases of million in personnel related expenses as a result of an increase in the number of employees and outside contractors engaged in research and development activities since december   and expenses related to changes in our employee insurance plan coverage premiums and matching contributions to our employee k plan  and million in legal and professional services fees as we increased activities related to patent protection and filings during these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in purchases of equipment and software specific to engineering as well as allocated overhead

 accounting for income taxes 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance including carryback opportunities to the extent available 
as a result of our adoption of fin in fiscal  we recorded an increase in the net liability for unrecognized tax positions of approximately million  which was recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit as of december   the first day of fiscal included in the unrecognized tax benefits at january  was approximately million of tax positions that  if recognized  would affect our annual effective tax rate 
our continuing practice is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense 
this policy did not change as a result of the adoption of fin at january   we had approximately million accrued for interest and accrued for penalties 
the company s unrecognized tax benefits may change over the next months as the statute of limitations on certain open years expire 
in fiscal  the company began operating under tax holidays in the prc  which are effective from january through december since the company operated at a loss in the prc in  it did not realize any benefit to its consolidated results of operations in attributable to the tax holidays 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through issuances of equity and debt securities and cash generated from operations 
we have also funded our operations with a revolving line of credit under our bank credit facility  capitalized lease obligations  financing of receivables and from the sale and leaseback of our domestic manufacturing facility 

table of contents working capital and cash and marketable securities the following table presents working capital  cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities in thousands january  december  working capital cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities included in working capital our working capital decreased in the year ended january  primarily as a result of i declines in certain current operating assets and liabilities  primarily due to the overall decline in net sales during the year ii the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  and iii the net paydown of the revolving line of credit

accounts receivable decreased approximately million during fiscal primarily as a result of the overall decline in our net sales during the year 
during  we were successful in collecting cash from sales to our customers substantially in accordance with our standard payment terms to those customers 
inventories decreased approximately million during fiscal primarily as a result of the overall decline in our net sales during the year 
in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined based on  among other factors  the level of customer orders received and overall demand as well as the stage at which our products are in their respective life cycles and competitive situations 
table of contents in the marketplace 
we make efforts to balance such considerations against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
accounts payable decreased approximately million during fiscal primarily as a result of an overall decline in materials purchasing levels during the year given our decline in net sales 
cash payments primarily for the purchase of manufacturing materials and related goods for resale to our customers used net operating cash of approximately million during net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of i approximately million in net non cash operating expenses  mainly comprised of inventory adjustments  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  impairment of long lived assets and deferred income taxes and ii approximately million in net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by a net loss of approximately million 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal which had a significant impact on cash provided by operating activities included i a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million  ii a decrease in inventories of approximately million due in part to sales of inventories on hand during the year to our customers  which generated net cash proceeds of approximately million and a loss of approximately million due to slow moving and lower of cost or market value inventory adjustments  and iii a decrease in accounts payable of approximately million 
in addition to the factors described above  all such decreases in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to the overall decline in the level of sales and related operating activities during as compared to investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended january  was primarily the result of proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities of approximately million  partially offset by purchases of investments in marketable securities of approximately million 
in we continued to invest remaining net proceeds from our initial public offering  or ipo  in various marketable securities investments in connection with our efforts to both preserve capital as well as achieve competitive returns on our investments 
we also used approximately million in cash primarily to purchase equipment and leasehold improvements related to our new facilities in the prc and in irvine  california 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of purchases of additional investments in marketable securities of approximately million  partially offset by proceeds received from maturities and sales of certain investments in marketable securities of approximately million 
in we continued to invest the majority of the proceeds from our ipo in various marketable securities investments in connection with our efforts to both preserve capital as well as achieve competitive returns on our investments

in may  we executed a ninth amendment to our credit agreement  which was effective as of the beginning of our second fiscal quarter of among other things  the amendment revised certain financial and other covenants which we are required to comply 
the amendment requires us to i limit capital expenditures under a defined annual cap  ii achieve certain minimum monthly profitability thresholds and iii maintain a minimum liquidity threshold as of the end of each month 
additionally  the amendment revised the interest rate on our borrowings on the revolving line of credit to fluctuate between the prime rate and prime plus based our combined monthly account balance with the bank 
furthermore  under the amendment  our nonrevolving equipment financing line of credit was revised to allow us to borrow up to an additional maximum of million to finance up to of the cost of equipment purchases through the end of fiscal principal on any of these additional borrowings is scheduled to be repaid in equal monthly installments commencing january  interest on our existing and future equipment line of credit advances is payable monthly at the prime rate

in october  we executed the tenth amendment to our amended and restated credit and security agreement  or the tenth amendment 
among other things  this amendment further revised our minimum profitability financial covenant requirement 
the tenth amendment also revised the monthly interest rate charged on credit advances under the line of credit and equipment line of credit to the greater of i the sum of the prime rate plus ii libor plus or iii 
as of january   we were in compliance with our financial covenants  however in october we were in violation of our financial covenant related to minimum monthly profitability 
in october  in connection with the execution of the tenth amendment  we received a waiver from our lender for this covenant violation 
we cannot assure that we will not violate one or more covenants in the future 
if we were to be in violation of covenants under our current credit agreement  our lender could choose to accelerate payment on all outstanding loan balances 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to quickly obtain equivalent or suitable replacement financing in this event 
if we were not able to secure alternative sources of funding  such acceleration would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
as of january   the prime rate was and our outstanding borrowings on our line of credit was zero 

table of contents we have in the past utilized equipment leasing arrangements to finance certain capital expenditures 
equipment leases will continue to be a financing alternative that we may pursue in the future 
in order to become profitable or to achieve and sustain positive cash flows from operations in the future  we must further reduce operating expenses and or increase our revenues 
during fiscal  we have completed a series of cost reduction actions which we believe have improved our operating cost structure 
these expense reductions alone may not make us profitable or allow us to sustain profitability if it is achieved 
our ability to achieve the necessary revenue growth will depend on  among other things  increased demand for our memory subsystem and related product offerings  as well as our ability to expand into new and emerging markets 
we may not be successful in achieving the necessary revenue growth or the expected expense reductions 
moreover  we may be unable to sustain past or expected future expense reductions in subsequent periods 
we may not achieve profitability or sustain such profitability  if achieved  on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we believe our existing cash and investment balances  borrowing availability under our bank credit facility  and the cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  during challenging economic times we may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit  which could result in our inability to meet certain of our financial obligations and other related commitments 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our levels of net sales  the timing and extent of expenditures to support research and development activities  the expansion of manufacturing capacity both domestically and internationally and the continued market acceptance of our products 
we could be required  or may choose  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional debt or equity financing or a combination thereof 
these additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt  and we have not entered into any synthetic leases 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships
