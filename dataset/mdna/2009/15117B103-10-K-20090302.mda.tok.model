table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as used herein  the terms we  us  our  the company  or celldex refer to celldex therapeutics  inc  a delaware corporation organized in formerly known as avant immunotherapeutics  inc and its subsidiaries celldex research corporation celldex research  celldex therapeutics  ltd 
celldex ltd and megan health  inc megan 
the company s principal activity since our inception has been research and product development conducted on our own behalf  as well as through joint development programs with several pharmaceutical companies and other collaborators 
the company changed its name from avant immunotherapeutics  inc to celldex therapeutics  inc on october  overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that uses novel applications of immunology to develop products for the prevention and treatment of diseases 
using our precision targeted immunotherapy platform  we are developing a broad portfolio of vaccines  therapeutic antibodies and other targeted immunotherapeutics addressing a wide range of applications including oncology  inflammatory and infectious diseases 
these include therapeutic cancer vaccines  monoclonal antibodies  single dose  oral vaccines that protect against important disease causing infectious agents and a treatment to reduce complement mediated tissue damage 
we are advancing a robust pipeline of clinical and preclinical product candidates  the most advanced of which are for treatment of various cancers 
our lead programs are therapeutic cancer vaccines designed to instruct the patient s immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells 
our strategy is to demonstrate proof of concept for our product candidates before leveraging their value through partnerships or  in appropriate situations  continuing late stage development ourselves 
demonstrating proof of concept for a product candidate generally involves bringing it through phase clinical trials and one or more phase clinical trials so that we are able to demonstrate  based on human trials  good safety data for the product candidate and some data indicating its effectiveness 
our current collaborations encompass the commercialization of an oral human rotavirus vaccine  the development of oral cholera  typhoid fever  etec and hiv vaccines  and a therapeutic brain cancer vaccine 
our product candidates address large market opportunities for which we believe current therapies are inadequate or non existent 
we are targeting our efforts where we can add the greatest value to the development of our products and technologies 
our goal is to demonstrate clinical proof of concept for each product  and then seek excellent partners to help see those products through to commercialization 
we thus leverage the value of its technology portfolio through corporate  governmental and non governmental partnerships 
this approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product 
merger between avant and celldex on march   we closed the merger the merger contemplated by the agreement and plan of merger dated october  by and among celldex formerly avant immunotherapeutics  inc  callisto merger corporation merger sub  a wholly owned subsidiary of celldex  and celldex research formerly celldex therapeutics  inc the merger agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  merger sub merged with and into celldex research  with celldex research as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the total value of the transaction was approximately million 
approximately million shares were issued to the former celldex research shareholders in connection with the merger 
the merger created a nasdaq listed  fully integrated and diversified biopharmaceutical company with a deep pipeline of product candidates 
table of contents addressing high value indications including oncology  infectious and inflammatory diseases 
former celldex research and former avant shareholders owned and of the combined company on a fully diluted basis  respectively 
our board of directors approved a for reverse stock split of the company s common stock  which became effective on march  as a result of the reverse stock split  each twelve shares of common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of common stock and the total number of shares outstanding was reduced from approximately million shares including the shares issued to former celldex research stockholders in the merger to approximately million shares 
the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and was treated as an acquisition by celldex research of celldex then avant  with celldex research being considered the accounting acquirer based on the application of criteria specified in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas  even though celldex then avant was the issuer of common stock and the surviving legal entity in the transaction 
under the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price was allocated to the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities  based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition  as follows tangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed net tangible assets acquired intangible assets acquired core technology developed technology strategic partner agreement in process research and development ipr d total the values assigned to the intangible assets acquired  including the ipr d  were determined based on fair market value using a risk adjusted discounted cash flow approach 
fair values for long term tangible and intangible assets and for ipr d were then reduced by  of negative goodwill 
the company is a biotechnology enterprise and its resources are substantially devoted to research and development at the date of the merger 
management is responsible for determining the fair value of the acquired ipr d 
the values assigned to ipr d relate to the development of a typhoid etec cholera combination travelers vaccine  a cholesterol management vaccine  and the cdx formerly tp complement inhibitor in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
each of these three significant research and development projects in process were valued through detailed analysis of product development data concerning the stage of development  time and resources needed to complete the project  expected income generating ability and associated risks 
the value of ipr d was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the probability of success and discount rates used for each project take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the purchased in process technology 
we expect to incur approximately million to move these projects to the point of out licensing them to third parties 
the estimated revenues from the typhoid etec cholera vaccine  the cholesterol management vaccine  and cdx are expected to be generated beginning in  and  respectively 
a discount rate of was used to value these projects  which we believe to be commensurate with the stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
the resulting net cash flows for these projects 
table of contents were based on management s best estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes for each project and the net cash flows reflect assumptions that would be used by market participants 
the significant assumptions underlying the valuations included potential revenues  costs of completion  the timing of product approvals and the selection of appropriate probability of success and discount rates 
none of the company s ipr d projects have reached technological feasibility nor do they have any alternative future use 
consequently  in accordance with current us gaap  the fair value allocated to ipr d was charged as an expense in the company s consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition 
the remaining acquired intangible assets arising from the acquisition are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated lives  which range from to years 
as of december   the technological feasibility of the projects had not yet been reached and no significant departures from the assumptions included in the valuation analysis had occurred 
substantial additional research and development will be required prior to reaching technological feasibility 
in addition  each product needs to successfully complete a series of clinical trials and to receive fda or other regulatory approval prior to commercialization 
the company is also dependent upon the activities of its collaborators in developing  manufacturing and marketing its products 
there can be no assurance that these projects will ever reach feasibility or develop into products that can be marketed profitably  nor can there be assurance that the company and its collaborators will be able to develop  manufacture and commercialize these products before the company s competitors 
if these products are not successfully developed and do not become commercially viable  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information 
because celldex research was determined to be the acquirer for accounting purposes  the historical financial statements of celldex research became the historical financial statements of the company 
accordingly  the financial statements of the company prior to the merger reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of celldex research  which  during the historical periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  was majority owned by medarex  inc medarex 
following the merger  the financial statements of the current period reflect the financial position  results of operation and cash flows of the company 
the results of operations of avant are included in the results of operations of the company beginning march  accordingly  except as otherwise discussed below  this report reflects the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of the combined companies at december  and historically of celldex research on a stand alone basis for all periods prior to march  the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of the company as of the years ended december   and may not be indicative of the company s future performance or reflect what the company s financial conditions  results of operations and liquidity would have been had the merger been consummated as of january   or had the company operated as a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
other acquisitions in october  celldex research completed the acquisitions of lorantis limited lorantis and alteris therapeutics  inc alteris 
celldex research issued approximately million shares of its class a common stock valued at million in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of lorantis 
net assets acquired included approximately million in cash  million of fixed assets  a working capital deficit of  and  of in process research and development ipr d  which was expensed in in addition  celldex research incurred approximately  of costs related to the acquisition of lorantis  which were expensed to ipr d 
table of contents in as of december   none of the acquired research and development projects had reached technological feasibility 
the purchase price for the alteris assets consisted of approximately  shares of celldex research common stock valued at million and approximately million in cash 
net assets acquired included approximately  of fixed assets  million in acquired intangible assets and million of ipr d  which was expensed in in addition  celldex research incurred approximately  of costs related to the acquisition of alteris  which were expensed to ipr d in celldex may be required to pay alteris up to million upon obtaining the first approval for commercial sale of an egfrviii product 
as of december   none of the acquired research and development projects had reached technological feasibility 
research and development activities our products are derived from a broad set of complementary technologies which have the ability to utilize the human immune system and enable the creation of preventative and therapeutic agents 
we are using these technologies to develop vaccines and targeted immunotherapeutics that prevent or treat cancer and disease caused by infectious organisms  and treatment vaccines that modify undesirable activity by the body s own proteins or cells 
a number of our immunotherapeutic and vaccine product candidates are in various stages of clinical trials 
we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical trial programs 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute celldex s business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
it is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of product candidates to each take five years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product candidate 
celldex estimates that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
celldex tests potential product candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology and immunogenicity 
celldex then may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 
an element of celldex s business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad portfolio of product candidates 
this is intended to allow celldex to diversify the risks associated with its research and development expenditures 
as a result  celldex believes its future capital requirements 
table of contents and its future financial success are not substantially dependent on any one product candidate 
to the extent celldex is unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates  celldex s dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates increases 
celldex s product candidates also have not yet received fda regulatory approval  which is required before celldex can market them as therapeutic or vaccine products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that celldex s clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
historically  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials through phase have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs  biologics and vaccines have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
furthermore  celldex s business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of celldex s product candidates 
in the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of celldex s product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than celldex 
celldex cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect celldex s development plan or capital requirements 
celldex s programs may also benefit from subsidies  grants  contracts or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce celldex s development costs 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  celldex is unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of its research and development projects or when  if ever  and to what extent it will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
celldex s inability to complete its research and development projects in a timely manner or its failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase its capital requirements and could adversely impact its liquidity 
these uncertainties could force celldex to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with its business strategy 
celldex s inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to it  would jeopardize the future success of its business 
during the past five years through the end of  celldex incurred an aggregate of million in research and development costs 
during the year ended december   celldex incurred an aggregate of million in research and development costs

table of contents program developments a 
cancer vaccine development programs cdx our lead clinical development program  cdx  is a peptide based immunotherapy that targets the tumor specific molecule called egfrviii  a functional variant of the naturally expressed epidermal growth factor receptor egfr  a protein which has been well validated as a target for cancer therapy 
unlike egfr  egfrviii is not present in normal tissues  and has been shown to be a transforming oncogene that can directly contribute to the cancer cell growth 
egfrviii is commonly present in glioblastoma multiforme  or gbm  the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer  and has also been observed in various other cancers such as breast  ovarian  prostate  colorectal  and head neck cancer 
with our partner  pfizer inc pfizer  we are currently pursuing the development of cdx for gbm therapy and plan to expand the clinical development into other cancers through additional clinical studies 
initial clinical development of egfrviii immunotherapy was led by collaborating investigators at the brain center at duke comprehensive cancer center in durham  north carolina and at md anderson cancer center in houston  texas 
the results from the phase victori and phase a activate studies  which enrolled and patients  respectively  have demonstrated a significant increase in the time to disease progression greater than in the patients who were vaccinated  and also in overall survival rates greater than  both relative to appropriately matched historical controls 
an extension of the phase a program act ii at the same two institutions has enrolled additional gbm patients treated in combination with temozolomide the current standard of care 
preliminary results from this study act ii currently estimates median overall survival to be months  although the median has not yet been reached 
the survival of a matched historical control group was months and a subgroup treated with temozolomide tmz of months  with a p value 
overall time to progression for cdx was months compared with months for the historical control group 
in may  we initiated a phase b randomized study act iii of cdx combined with standard of care  temozolomide  versus standard of care alone in patients with gbm 
we intend to open a total of over sites in the united states for the study 
the fda has granted orphan drug designation for cdx for the treatment of egfrviii expressing gbm as well as fast track designation 
in december  we announced an amendment to convert the act iii study to a single arm phase clinical trial in which all patients will receive cdx in combination with temozolomide and we will continue to enroll to approximately patients 
the decision  which follows the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee  was based on the observation that the majority of patients randomized to the control standard of care arm withdrew from this open label study after being randomized to the control arm 
patients currently participating on the control arm of the study will be offered the option to receive treatment with cdx under this amendment  the act iii study will provide a multi center  non randomized dataset for cdx in patients with newly diagnosed gbm 
these data will provide important additional information that can be used to better design the future development of cdx on april   the company and pfizer entered into a license and development agreement the pfizer agreement under which pfizer was granted an exclusive worldwide license to cdx the pfizer agreement also gives pfizer exclusive rights to the use of egfrviii vaccines in other potential indications 
under the pfizer agreement  pfizer made an upfront payment to the company of million and made a million equity investment in the company 
pfizer will fund all development costs for these programs 
the company is also eligible to receive potential milestone payments exceeding million for the successful development and commercialization of cdx and additional egfrviii vaccine products  as well as royalties on any product sales 
the pfizer agreement 
table of contents became effective after clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of as amended on may  cdx the company s lead apc targeting technology product candidate  cdx  is in development for the treatment of epithelial tumors such as colorectal  pancreatic  bladder  ovarian and breast cancers 
cdx targets the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin  known as hcg beta  which is an antigen often found in epithelial tumors 
the presence of hcg beta in these cancers correlates with a poor clinical outcome  suggesting that this molecule may contribute to tumor growth 
normal adult tissues have minimal expression of hcg beta  therefore  targeted immune responses are not expected to generate significant side effects 
celldex is completing two phase studies at multiple centers that are designed to explore safety and dose effect relationships via two administration routes intradermal id  a traditional vaccine route that allows efficient access to local dermal dendritic cells and intravenous iv  a novel systemic approach to vaccination that might target a much larger population of dendritic cells 
in both studies  there are dose escalations of cdx alone and cdx with the adjuvant gm csf known to increase mannose receptor expression on dendritic cells 
at the highest dose levels planned  additional immune system modulators toll like receptor agonists  or tlr agonists have been added to determine what effect they have in augmenting an immune response 
patients with an assortment of different tumor types that are known to express hcg beta are being accrued with retrospective analysis for hcg beta expression 
a four dose regimen is utilized with the possibility of retreatment if patients demonstrate tumor regression or stable disease 
over fifty patients with epithelial cancers have been treated in the phase clinical trials and more than half have evidence of hcg beta expression by their tumor 
the immunotherapy has been well tolerated with only minor adverse events observed reddening at the injection site 
analysis of the initial cohorts with gm csf have revealed that several patients developed good humoral responses to hcg beta  and some have demonstrated enhancement of circulating hcg beta specific cd t cells 
thus  we are encouraged that cdx is providing similar results as predicted in the pre clinical studies 
in addition  one patient with pancreatic cancer had a overall reduction in tumor burden and two breast cancer patients were stable for six months during treatment 
the investigators at the duke comprehensive cancer center were awarded a two year  grant from the avon foundation and the national cancer institute to support phase work in breast cancer 
the safety of cdx in combination with defined immune system modulators is now being evaluated with intent to enter phase clinical research in the second half of cdx cdx is a fusion protein consisting of a fully human monoclonal antibody with specificity for the dendritic cell receptor  dec  linked to the ny eso tumor antigen 
in humans  ny eso is one of the most immunogenic tumor antigens and has been detected in of cancers  thus representing a broad opportunity 
this product is intended to selectively deliver the ny eso antigen to apcs for generating robust immune responses against cancer cells expressing ny eso unlike cdx  which targets the mannose receptor expressing dendritic cells  cdx is the first apc product targeting dec expressing dendritic cells 
we are developing cdx for the treatment of malignant melanoma and a variety of solid tumors which express the proprietary cancer antigen ny eso  which the company licensed from the ludwig institute for cancer research in the company believes that preclinical studies have shown that cdx is effective for activation of human t cell responses against ny eso the ind filing is planned for the first half of we expect to be able to enter a phase study with a combination regimen  including tlrs  and will accrue multiple tumors that express ny eso cdx celldex has entered into a license agreement with the university of southampton  uk  to develop human antibodies to cd  a potentially important target for immunotherapy of various cancers 
in pre clinical models  antibodies to cd alone have been shown to mediate 
table of contents anti tumor effects  and may be particularly effective in combination with other immunotherapies 
cd is a critical molecule in the activation pathway of lymphocytes 
it is downstream from cd  and may provide a novel way to regulate the immune responses 
engaging cd with the appropriate monoclonal antibody has proven highly effective at promoting anti cancer immunity in mouse models 
we are currently evaluating new human monoclonal antibodies in pre clinical models 
b 
inflammatory disease development programs cdx formerly tp we have been developing immunotherapeutics that inhibit a part of the immune system called the complement system 
the complement system is a series of proteins that are important initiators of the body s acute inflammatory response against disease  infection and injury 
excessive complement activation also plays a role in some persistent inflammatory conditions 
our lead compound  cdx  a soluble form of naturally occurring complement receptor  has effectively shown to inhibit the activation of the complement cascade in animal models and in human clinical trials 
we believe that regulating the complement system could have therapeutic and prophylactic applications in several acute and chronic conditions  including organ transplantation  multiple sclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis  age related macular degeneration amd  atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and myasthenia gravis 
we are currently defining the most appropriate clinical development path for cdx and are focusing on rare disease conditions of unregulated complement activation as the fastest route to fda approval 
cdx celldex is developing therapeutic human antibodies to a signaling molecule known as cd or fca receptor type i fcari 
cd is expressed by some white blood cells and leukemic cell lines  and has been shown to be important in controlling inflammation and tumor growth in animal models 
celldex has proprietary  fully human antibodies to cd in preclinical development 
depending upon the specific antibody used  anti cd antibodies can either be activating and thus stimulate immune responses  or down regulating and act as an anti inflammatory agent 
c 
infectious disease development programs choleragarde vaccine choleragarde is designed to be a safe  effective single dose  oral cholera vaccine 
our partner  the international vaccine institute ivi  has received million in funding from the bill melinda gates foundation for a cholera vaccine initiative chovi  includes conducting further clinical trials of choleragarde 
the ivi is presently conducting a phase clinical trial of choleragarde in bangladesh  with plans to sponsor additional phase studies in india and thailand beginning in the first half of  followed by phase field studies 
etec vaccine in november  we entered into an agreement with the division of microbiology and infectious diseases of the niaid  whereby niaid is sponsoring a phase study of celldex s investigational single dose  oral vaccine designed to offer combined protection against both enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec and cholera 
in june  niaid initiated the phase trial of the etec vaccine candidate at cincinnati children s hospital medical center 
in january  we entered into an exclusive license and development agreement with vaccine technologies  inc vti 
under the license agreement  celldex has granted a worldwide fee and royalty bearing exclusive license to vti to development and commercialize celldex s choleragarde and etec vaccine programs 
financial terms of the agreement with vti include an upfront license fee  milestone payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products during the term of the agreement 
ty typhoid fever vaccine the company has developed an oral vaccine to offer rapid  single dose protection against salmonella typhi  the cause of typhoid fever 
ty is targeted for both the travelers market and global health needs 
in  the national institute of allergy and infectious disease niaid of the national institutes of health nih initiated a phase in patient 
table of contents dose ranging clinical trial aimed at demonstrating the safety and immunogenicity of the ty typhoid fever vaccine 
niaid funded the production of ty vaccine for clinical testing and completed the phase trial at a nih funded clinical site in results showed the single dose  oral vaccine to be well tolerated and immunogenic  with over of vaccinated subjects generating immune responses 
we initiated our own sponsored phase trial of ty in july preliminary results reported in april from the study showed that the single dose  oral vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic  demonstrating that the desired immune response was achieved 
incidence of reactogenicity symptoms and adverse events post vaccination were similar to placebo 
importantly  immunogenic response was dose dependent 
positive immune response or seroconversion prospectively defined as a fold increase in anti lps titers over pre dose level rates were and in the low and high dose groups  respectively  and was significantly p higher than placebo 
cdx the company is also using its apc targeting technology to develop vaccines against infectious disease 
the lead program is cdx  an apc targeting prophylactic vaccine  aimed at providing protection from infection with hiv  the virus known to cause aids 
this program is in a bill melinda gates foundation funded partnership with collaborators at rockefeller university in new york city  who have shown in model systems that protective immunity can be induced with such a vaccine 
preclinical studies and manufacturing development are in progress and the company  with its collaborators  plans to file an ind for phase clinical studies in the first half of d 
marketed products rotavirus vaccine rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea and vomiting in infants and children 
in  we licensed our oral rotavirus strain to glaxosmithkline glaxo 
all of the ongoing development for this program is being conducted and funded by glaxo 
glaxo gained approval for its rotavirus vaccine  rotarix  in mexico in july  which represented the first in a series of worldwide approvals and commercial launches for the product 
glaxo subsequently launched rotarix in additional latin american and asian pacific countries during additionally  glaxo filed for market approval with the european regulatory authorities in late  which triggered a million milestone payment to the company 
in february  the european commission granted approval of rotarix in the european union  which triggered a million milestone payment from glaxo 
on april   rotarix received approval from the fda for the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants 
fda approval triggered a million milestone payment from glaxo  of which  was retained by the company 
we licensed in the rotavirus strain in and owe a license fee of to cincinnati children s hospital medical center cch on net royalties received from glaxo 
in may  the company entered into an agreement whereby an affiliate of paul royalty fund prf purchased an interest in the net royalties the company will receive on worldwide sales of rotarix see note of our consolidated financial statements 
the market launch of rotarix by glaxo in the us market during the quarter ended september  resulted in a million milestone payment to the company from prf  which the company received on october  we have received a total of million in milestone payments under the prf agreement 
no additional milestone payments are due from prf under the agreement 
in september  we received notice from glaxo that glaxo would begin paying royalties on sales of rotarix vaccine at the lower of two royalty rates under their license agreement 
glaxo s decision to pay the lower royalty rate which is of the full rate is based upon glaxo s assertion that rotarix is not covered by the patents glaxo licensed from the company in australia and certain european countries 
if glaxo s position stands  the royalties to which prf is entitled will no longer be limited by a million annual threshold  which the company projected may have been reached in later years as sales of rotarix increased 
irrespective of glaxo s position  we will still retain approximately of the royalties on worldwide sales of rotarix once prf receives times the 
table of contents aggregate cash payments of million it made to the company  though the potential amount of such residual royalties will be lower if glaxo s position stands 
megan vac and megan egg vaccines on december   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of megan 
megan has commercialized three veterinary vaccines  argus sc  licensed by the united states department of agriculture usda in march and marketed by intervet  inc  and megan vac and megan egg  licensed by the usda in november and  respectively  and marketed by lohmann animal health international lahi 
in january  we sold the poultry vaccines business  consisting of megan vac and megan egg  to lahi for an upfront fee and potential milestone payments 
technology licensing we have adopted a business strategy of out licensing technology and programs that do not match our development focus or where we lack sufficient resources for the technology s or program s efficient development or where certain uses of the technology are outside of our focus 
for example  when the company acquired megan  it entered into a licensing agreement in december with pfizer s animal health division to leverage the value of megan s oral vaccine technology in a significant market opportunity animal health and human food safety outside of the company s own focus on human health care 
under this pfizer agreement  we may receive additional milestone payments of up to million based upon attainment of specified milestones 
we may receive royalty payments on eventual product sales 
the term of this agreement is through the expiration of the last of the patents covered by the agreement 
similarly  in january  we sold our poultry vaccines business  consisting of megan vac and megan egg  to lahi and out licensed our choleragarde and etec vaccine programs to vti 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition for agreements entered into with various collaborators  accounting for long lived assets  the amortization policy for acquired intangible assets and the estimates of costs incurred and assumptions made in recording accrued clinical research and contract manufacturing costs and assumptions made in calculating the fair value of stock based compensation expense 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company accounts for revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no

eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying the guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can only be considered as separate units of accounting if i the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
table of contents and iii if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
payments received to fund certain research activities are recognized as revenue in the period in which the research activities are performed 
payments received in advance that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue when the research projects are performed 
the company has entered into various license and development agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on net product sales 
non refundable license fees are recognized as contract and license fee revenue when the company has a contractual right to receive such payments  provided that i a contractual arrangement exists  ii the contract price is fixed or determinable  iii the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and iv the company has no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
upfront non refundable fees associated with license and development agreements where the company has continuing performance obligations under the terms of the agreement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the estimated service period as the company completes its obligations 
where the company s level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period or no other pattern is estimable  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on management s part 
funding of research and development is recognized as revenue over the term of the applicable contract as costs are incurred related to that contract 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed milestones  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there is no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met i the milestone payments are non refundable  ii achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  iii substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and  iv the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as celldex completes its performance obligations 
the company has capitalized and deferred costs incurred in connection with the one time signing and upfront payment the initial deliverable received with respect to a multiple deliverable arrangement 
if there is deemed a single unit of accounting for such an arrangement  the capitalized deferred costs are amortized over the expected performance period of the arrangement 
revenue from contracts and grants  including us government grants under small business innovation research sbir  is recognized as the services are performed and recorded as effort is expended on the contracted work and billed to the government or our contractual partners 
product royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize celldex s licensed technologies and are recognized when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to us in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement 
payments received in advance of activities being performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
any significant changes in the company s estimates or assumptions could impact its revenue recognition 

table of contents long lived assets in the ordinary course of its business  the company incurs substantial costs to construct property and equipment 
the treatment of costs to construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
costs incurred in the project planning and design phase  and in the construction and installation phase  are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset 
the company stops capitalizing costs when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
determining the appropriate period during which to capitalize costs  and assessing whether particular costs qualify for capitalization  requires us to make significant judgments 
these judgments can have a material impact on our reported results 
for manufacturing property and equipment  the company also capitalizes the cost of validating these assets for the underlying manufacturing process 
celldex completes the capitalization of validation costs when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
costs capitalized include incremental labor and fringe benefits  and direct consultancy services 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
laboratory equipment and office furniture and equipment are depreciated over a five year period and computer equipment is depreciated over a three year period 
manufacturing equipment is amortized over a seven to ten year period 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the non cancelable term of the related lease  including any renewals that are reasonably assured of occurring 
property and equipment under construction is classified as construction in progress and is depreciated or amortized only after the asset is placed in service 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense whereas the costs of significant improvements which extend the life of the underlying asset are capitalized 
upon retirement or sale  the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the related gains or losses are reflected in net income 
determining the economic lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
amortization of intangible assets the company has acquired intangible assets  which include core technology  developed technology and a strategic partner agreement  through the merger and the acquisition of lorantis limited 
these acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated lives  which range from to years 
the determination of the amortization period involves estimates and judgments on management s part 
any significant changes in the company s estimates or assumptions could impact the carrying value of acquired intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of these assets when facts and circumstances suggest the asset could be impaired in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and intangible assets for potential impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  sfas no 

the company performs these evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
indicators of potential impairment include a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in its business or the industry in which it is sold  and a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset 

table of contents if the company believes an indicator of potential impairment exists  the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying asset 
the net book value of an asset is adjusted to fair value if its expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than its book value 
the company charges impairments of the long lived assets to operations if its evaluations indicate that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
we have identified no indicators of impairment at december  when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or long lived assets is not recoverable  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that have not been previously recorded 
accrued clinical research and contract manufacturing costs the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period reported 
specifically  celldex s management must make estimates of costs incurred to date  but not yet invoiced by external entities such as clinical research organizations cros and contract manufacturing organizations cmos 
for cros  management analyzes the progress of clinical trials  contract amendments for specific work  invoices received  and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability 
for cmos  management analyzes the progress of process development and scale up efforts and the production of clinical materials  contract amendments signed for specific work  invoices received  and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability 
the company accrues these expenses based upon its assessment of the status of each study or manufacturing activity and the work completed  and upon information obtained from the cros and cmos 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results may differ from the amount and timing of the accrued balance for any period 
in connection with certain clinical research agreements the company makes payments in advance of the services performed 
the company accounts for these payments under the provisions of eitf issue no 
eitf  accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf is limited to non refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement

sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the company estimates the fair value of share based awards granted using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables
