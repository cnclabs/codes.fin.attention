item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview grt is a self administered and self managed reit which commenced business operations in january at the time of its initial public offering 
the company  we  us and our are references to grt  glimcher properties limited partnership gplp or operating partnership  as well as entities in which the company has an interest 
we own  lease  manage and develop a portfolio of retail properties properties consisting of enclosed regional and super regional malls malls and community shopping centers community centers 
as of december   we owned interests in and managed properties located in states  consisting of malls two of which are partially owned through a joint venture and four community centers one of which is partially owned through a joint venture 
the properties contain an aggregate of approximately million square feet of gross leasable area gla of which approximately was occupied at december  our primary business objective is to achieve growth in net income and funds from operations ffo by developing and acquiring retail properties  by improving the operating performance and value of our existing portfolio through selective expansion and renovation of our properties  and by maintaining high occupancy rates  increasing minimum rents per square foot of gla  and aggressively controlling costs 
key elements of our growth strategies and operating policies are to increase property values by aggressively marketing available gla and renewing existing leases  negotiate and sign leases which provide for regular or fixed contractual increases to minimum rents  capitalize on management s long standing relationships with national and regional retailers and extensive experience in marketing to local retailers  as well as exploit the leverage inherent in a larger portfolio of properties in order to lease available space  establish and capitalize on strategic joint venture relationships to maximize capital resource availability  utilize our team oriented management approach to increase productivity and efficiency  acquire strategically located malls  hold properties for long term investment and emphasize regular maintenance  periodic renovation and capital improvements to preserve and maximize value  selectively dispose of assets we believe have achieved long term investment potential and redeploy the proceeds  control operating costs by utilizing our employees to perform management  leasing  marketing  finance  accounting  construction supervision  legal and information technology services  renovate  reconfigure or expand properties and utilize existing land available for expansion and development of outparcels to meet the needs of existing or new tenants  and utilize our development capabilities to develop quality properties at low cost 

table of contents our strategy is to be a leading reit focusing on enclosed malls and other anchored retail properties located primarily in the top metropolitan statistical areas by population 
we expect to continue investing in select development opportunities and in strategic acquisitions of mall properties that provide growth potential while disposing of non strategic assets 
we expect to finance acquisition transactions with cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facilities  proceeds from strategic joint venture partners  asset dispositions  secured mortgage financings  the issuance of equity or debt securities  or a combination of one or more of the foregoing 
during the last four years  we have made substantial progress in our disposition of non strategic assets 
from the period beginning december  through december   we reduced the number of properties held from to our disposition program s goal was to enhance the quality and growth profile of our portfolio of properties 
the first phase of the program was to divest from a majority of our community center assets which was driven by our decision to evolve from a community center company to one founded on higher growth mall properties 
once that phase was substantially completed  we commenced a program to sell non strategic mall assets that lacked the quality characteristics we wanted for long term investment and focused on re investment into higher quality malls and improving our existing portfolio through redevelopment 
in implementing the disposition program  we disposed of community centers and malls during this period 
we re invested the proceeds from these asset dispositions in higher quality properties during the above referenced four year period 
during that time  we acquired three malls two through a joint venture that were new to our portfolio and developed one new community center through a joint venture 
we had one community center and two malls held for sale at the end of critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of trustees and the company s independent registered public accounting firm 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the critical accounting policies discussed in this section reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy relating to minimum rents does not require the use of significant estimates 
minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis over the term of the related leases on a straight line basis 
percentage rents  tenant reimbursements  and components of other revenue associated with the margins related to outparcel sales include estimates 
percentage rents percentage rents  which are based on tenants sales as reported to the company  are recognized once the sales reported by such tenants exceed any applicable breakpoints as specified in the tenants leases 
the percentage rents are recognized based upon the measurement dates specified in the leases which indicate when the percentage rent is due 

table of contents tenant reimbursements estimates are used to record cost reimbursements from tenants for cam  real estate tax  utilities and insurance 
we recognize revenue based upon the amounts to be reimbursed from our tenants for these items in the same period these reimbursable expenses are incurred 
differences between estimated cost reimbursements and final amounts billed are recognized in the subsequent year 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and variations exist in computations between properties and tenants 
the company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes  cam and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual reimbursements versus actual expenses 
adjustments are also made throughout the year to these receivables and the related cost reimbursement income based upon the company s best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected 
if management s estimate of the percent of recoverable expenses that can be billed to the tenants in differs from actual amounts billed by  the amount of income recorded during would increase or decrease by million 
outparcel sales the company sells outparcels at its various properties 
the estimated cost used to calculate the margin from these sales involves a number of estimates 
the estimates made are based either upon assigning a proportionate value based upon historical cost paid for the total parcel to the portion of the parcel that is sold  or by incorporating the sales value method 
the proportionate share of actual cost is derived through consideration of numerous factors 
these factors include items such as ease of access to the parcel  visibility from high traffic areas and other factors that may differentiate the desirability of the particular section of the parcel that is sold 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the company s estimate of the amounts of the recorded accounts receivable at the balance sheet date that will not be recovered from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
the company s policy is to record a periodic provision for doubtful accounts based on total revenues 
the company also periodically reviews specific tenant balances and determines whether an additional allowance is necessary 
in recording such a provision  the company considers a tenant s creditworthiness  ability to pay  probability of collections and consideration of the retail sector in which the tenant operates 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed based upon the company s historical experience 
investment in real estate carrying value of assets the company maintains a diverse portfolio of real estate assets 
the portfolio holdings have increased as a result of both acquisitions and the development of new properties and have been reduced by selected sales of assets 
the amounts to be capitalized as a result of acquisition and developments and the periods over which the assets are depreciated or amortized are determined based on the application of accounting standards that may require estimates as to fair value and the allocation of various costs to the individual assets 
the company allocates the cost of the acquisition based upon the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company also estimates the fair value of intangibles related to its acquisitions 
the valuation of the fair value of the intangibles involves estimates related to market conditions  probability of lease renewals and the current market value of in place leases 
this market value is determined by considering factors such as the tenant s industry  location within the property and competition in the specific market in which the property operates 
differences in the amount attributed to the intangible assets can be significant based upon the assumptions made in calculating these estimates 
impairment evaluation management evaluates the recoverability of its investment in real estate assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of the investment in the asset is not assured 

table of contents the company evaluates the recoverability of its investments in real estate assets to be held and used each quarter and records an impairment charge when there is an indicator of impairment and the undiscounted projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount for a particular property 
the estimated cash flows used for the impairment analysis and the determination of estimated fair value are based on the company s plans for the respective assets and the company s views of market and economic conditions 
the estimates consider matters such as current and historical rental rates  occupancies for the respective properties and comparable properties and recent sales data for comparable properties 
changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in the company s plans or views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses  which  under the applicable accounting guidance  could be substantial 
investment in real estate held for sale the company evaluates the held for sale classification of its owned real estate each quarter 
assets that are classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
assets are generally classified as held for sale once management commits to a plan to sell the properties and has initiated an active program to market them for sale 
the results of operations of these real estate properties are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods reported 
on occasion  the company will receive unsolicited offers from third parties to buy individual properties 
under these circumstances  the company will classify the particular property as held for sale when a sales contract is executed with no contingencies and the prospective buyer has funds at risk to ensure performance 
sale of real estate assets the sale of real estate assets may also involve the application of judgments in determining whether the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer and that a sale has been completed for purposes of recognizing a gain on the sale 
the company recognizes property sales in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the company generally records the sales of operating properties and outparcels using the full accrual method at closing  when the earnings process is deemed to be complete 
sales not qualifying for full recognition at the time of sale are accounted for under other appropriate deferral methods 
accounting for acquisitions the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases for acquired in place leases  the value of tenant relationships  and the value of in place leases  based in each case on their fair values 
purchase accounting is applied to assets and liabilities related to real estate entities acquired based upon the percentage of interest acquired 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  building and tenant improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
management determines the as if vacant fair value of a property using methods to determine the replacement cost of the tangible assets 
in determining the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the initial lease term 
the aggregate value of in place leases is determined by evaluating various factors  including an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions and similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
the value assigned to this intangible asset is amortized over the remaining lease term plus an assumed renewal period that is reasonably assured 

table of contents the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets include tenant relationships 
factors considered by management in assigning a value to these relationships include assumptions of probability of lease renewals  investment in tenant improvements  leasing commissions and an approximate time lapse in rental income while a new tenant is located 
the value assigned to this intangible asset is amortized over the average life of the relationship 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense for real estate assets is computed using a straight line method and estimated useful lives for buildings and improvements using a weighted average composite life of forty years and equipment and fixtures of three to ten years 
expenditures for leasehold improvements and construction allowances paid to tenants are capitalized and amortized over the initial term of each lease 
cash allowances paid to retailers that are used for purposes other than improvements to the real estate are amortized as a reduction to minimum rents over the initial lease term 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
cash allowances paid in return for operating covenants from retailers who own their real estate are capitalized as contract intangibles 
these intangibles are amortized over the period the retailer is required to operate their store 
investment in unconsolidated real estate entities the company evaluates all joint venture arrangements for consolidation 
the percentage interest in the joint venture  evaluation of control and whether a variable interest entity vie exists are all considered in determining if the arrangement qualifies for consolidation 
the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated real estate entities using the equity method of accounting  whereby the cost of an investment is adjusted for the company s share of equity in net income or loss beginning on the date of acquisition and reduced by distributions received 
the income or loss of each investee is allocated in accordance with the provisions of the applicable operating agreements 
the allocation provisions in these agreements may differ from the ownership interest held by each investor 
differences between the carrying amount of the company s investment in the respective investees and the company s share of the underlying equity of such unconsolidated entities are amortized over the respective lives of the underlying assets as applicable 
the company periodically reviews its investment in unconsolidated real estate entities for other than temporary declines in market value 
any decline that is not expected to be recovered in the next twelve months is considered other than temporary and an impairment charge is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
no impairment charges were recognized during the year ended december  relating to our investment in unconsolidated real estate entities 
deferred costs the company capitalizes initial direct costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  and amortizes these costs over the initial lease term 
the costs are capitalized upon the execution of the lease and the amortization period begins the earlier of the store opening date or the date the tenant s lease obligation begins 
derivatives the company recognizes all derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in our financial statements under stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income or as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item 
changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in earnings 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge ie  hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into net income or interest expense in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects interest income or interest expense 
the remaining gain or loss of the derivative instruments in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  if any  is ineffective and is recognized in our financial statements in other income or other expense during the period of the change 
upon termination of a derivative instrument prior to maturity  the aforementioned adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income is amortized or accreted into interest income or interest expense over the remaining term of the hedge relationship using the effective interest method 
should the hedged item mature  be sold or be extinguished prior to the end of the hedge relationship or a forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring  the aforementioned amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to interest income or interest expense and the derivative instrument s change in fair value from that point forward will be recorded in other income or other expense 

table of contents funds from operations our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
we have indicated that ffo is a key measure of financial performance 
ffo is an important and widely used financial measure of operating performance in our industry  which we believe provides important information to investors and a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
we believe that ffo is an appropriate and valuable measure of our operating performance because real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains a residual value to a much greater extent than personal property and  accordingly  reductions for real estate depreciation and amortization charges are not meaningful in evaluating the operating results of the properties 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit as net income or loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable assets  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does include impairment losses for properties held for sale and held for use 
the company s ffo may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
the following table illustrates the calculation of ffo and the reconciliation of ffo to net loss income available to common shareholders for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  net loss income available to common shareholders add back less real estate depreciation and amortization equity in loss income of unconsolidated entities pro rata share of joint venture funds from operations minority interest in operating partnership gain on sales of properties funds from operations ffo comparison of year ended december  to december  ffo increased by million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period ended december  contributing to this increase was a million improvement in property net operating income from our properties held in continuing operations 
the main factor contributing to this increase was the additional operating income obtained following the acquisition of merritt square mall 
also during the year ended december   we recorded million of impairment charges 
there were no impairment charges for the same period in lastly  we incurred million less in interest expense which was primarily attributed to lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest 
offsetting these increases to ffo  we received million less in property net operating income from properties that were sold during and also  we received million less in ffo from our unconsolidated real estate entities primarily attributed to a million favorable variance when we recorded our tenant reconciliations in as well as increased provision for doubtful accounts 

table of contents ffo comparison of year ended december  to december  ffo increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during  we incurred million in impairment charges related to four malls and one community center 
during  we incurred million of impairment charges primarily related to three mall properties  one of which was sold during  and the other two malls which are currently classified as held for sale 
also  we incurred million less in interest expense 
the primary driver of this decrease in interest expense can be attributed to a million defeasance charge incurred during associated with early retirement of the mortgage loan for university mall  which was sold during offsetting these increases to ffo was a million decline in lease termination income

liquidity and capital resources liquidity our short term less than one year liquidity requirements include recurring operating costs  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  and dividend requirements for our preferred shares  common shares and units of partnership interest in the operating partnership op units 
we anticipate that these needs will be met primarily with cash flows provided by operations

we are required to pay the lender i periodic payments of interest on the amount outstanding under the loan agreement at an interest rate of per annum  ii monthly installments of taxes and insurance in accordance with the loan agreement  and iii monthly installments of a cash management fee 
the agreement requires us to make the aforementioned payments during the period between the effective date and the earlier of september  and the earliest date on which we have funded the mall operating costs in an aggregate amount equal to the cost cap the modification period 
under the agreement  all of the aforementioned payments are included in mall operating costs 
furthermore  we are not required during the modification period to make any payments of principal on the amount outstanding under the loan agreement 
together with the lender  during the modification period  we will jointly market the sale of the mall to third party buyers
