at each three year or five year anniversary date of the mortgages  the interest rate is renegotiated and the term of the loan is extended for an additional three or five years 
at each three year or five year anniversary date of the mortgages  the bank also has the right to require payment in full 
these are included in the due in one to five years category in the table above 
the borrower has the right to prepay the loan at any time 

table of contents asset quality performance of the entire loan and lease portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by bank management and loan officers 
a number of factors regarding the borrower  such as overall financial strength  collateral values and repayment ability  are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectibility of interest for accrual purposes 
when a loan or lease  including a loan or lease impaired under sfas  is classified as nonaccrual  the accrual of interest on such a loan or lease is discontinued 
a loan or lease is classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectibility of principal or interest  even though the loan or lease is currently performing 
a loan or lease may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured 
when a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status  unpaid interest credited to income is reversed 
interest received on nonaccrual loans and leases is either applied against principal or reported as interest income  according to management s judgment as to the collectability of principal 
loans or leases are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current  has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time  and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt 
total cash basis  restructured and nonaccrual loans and leases totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december   and consist mainly of commercial  financial and real estate construction loans 
for the years ended december   and  nonaccrual loans and leases resulted in lost interest income of thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
the corporation s ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and leases and other real estate owned was as of december   as of december   and as of december  at december   the recorded investment in loans and leases that are considered to be impaired under sfas was million  all of which were on a nonaccrual basis or trouble debt restructured 
the related reserve for loan and lease losses for those loans was thousand 
nonaccruing loans decreased during primarily due to paydowns and charge offs of million 
these decreases were offset by additional nonaccrual loans of million 
specific reserves of thousand have been established for these loans based on current facts and management s judgments about the ultimate outcome of these credits 
the amount of the specific reserve needed for these credits could change in future periods subject to changes in facts and judgments related to these credits 
the corporation acquired two other real estate owned properties during there were no other real estate owned properties as of december  at december   nonaccruing loans consisted of million in real estate commercial loans  thousand in commercial loans  million in real estate construction loans  thousand in real estate residential loans and thousand in lease financings

table of contents table nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans and leases the following table details the aggregate principal balance of loans and leases classified as nonaccrual  past due and restructured as of the dates indicated at december  nonaccruing loans and leases accruing loans and leases days or more past due real estate loans secured by family dwellings secured by commercial properties commercial and industrial loans and leases loans to individuals total accruing loans and leases  days or more past due restructured loans and leases  not included above other real estate owned reserve for loan and lease losses management believes the reserve for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level that is adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
management s methodology to determine the adequacy of and the provision to the reserve considers specific credit reviews  past loan and lease loss experience  current economic conditions and trends  loan volume  loan growth  and the composition of the portfolio 
the reserve for loan and lease losses is determined through a monthly evaluation of reserve adequacy 
quarterly  this analysis takes into consideration the growth of the loan and lease portfolio  the status of past due loans and leases  current economic conditions  various types of lending activity  policies  real estate and other loan commitments  and significant changes in charge off activity 
nonaccrual loans and leases are evaluated individually 
all other loans and leases are evaluated as pools 
based on historical loss experience  loss factors are determined giving consideration to the areas noted in the first paragraph and applied to the pooled loan and lease categories to develop the general or allocated portion of the reserve 
loans are also reviewed for impairment based on discounted cash flows using the loans initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans as provided under sfas management also reviews the activity within the allowance to determine what actions  if any  should be taken to address differences between estimated and actual losses 
any of the above factors may cause the reserve to fluctuate 
wholesale leasing portfolios are purchased by the bank s subsidiary  univest capital 
credit losses on these purchased portfolios are largely the responsibility of the seller up to pre set dollar amounts initially equal to to percent of the portfolio purchase amount 
the dollar amount of recourse for purchased portfolios is inclusive of cash holdbacks and purchase discounts 
the reserve for loan and lease losses is based on management s evaluation of the loan or lease portfolio under current economic conditions and such other factors  which  in management s opinion  deserve recognition in estimating loan and lease losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
additions to the reserve arise from the provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations or from the recovery of amounts previously charged off 
loan and lease charge offs reduce the reserve 
loans and leases are charged off when there 
table of contents has been permanent impairment or when in the opinion of management the full amount of the loan and lease  in the case of non collateral dependent borrowings  will not be realized 
certain impaired loans are reported at the present value of expected future cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 
the reserve for loan and lease losses consists of an allocated reserve and unallocated reserve categories 
the allocated reserve is comprised of reserves established on specific loans and leases  and class reserves based on historical loan loss and lease experience  current trends  and management assessments 
the unallocated reserve is based on both general economic conditions and other risk factors in the corporation s individual markets and portfolios 
the specific reserve element is based on a regular analysis of impaired commercial and real estate loans 
for these loans  the specific reserve established is based on an analysis of related collateral value  cash flow considerations and  if applicable  guarantor capacity 
the class reserve element is determined by an internal loan and lease grading process in conjunction with associated allowance factors 
the corporation revises the class allowance factors whenever necessary  but no less than quarterly  in order to address improving or deteriorating credit quality trends or specific risks associated with a given loan or lease pool classification 
the corporation maintains a reserve in other liabilities for off balance sheet credit exposures that currently are unfunded in categories with historical loss experience 
table allocated  other loan and lease loss reserves the reserve for loan and lease losses is made up of the allocated reserve and the unallocated portion 
the following table summarizes the two categories as of the dates indicated at december  allocated unallocated total allocated reserves in increased by thousand as higher allocations to account for growth in the lease financings portfolio were more than offset by lower reserves against declining indirect and commercial loan portfolios 
lease financings  net of unearned discounts  rose to million at december  from million when compared to the same period in homogeneous retail loans  including residential real estate and consumer loans outstanding  declined by million  contributing to a homogeneous loan pool allocation reduction of thousand 
commercial loans including commercial real estate loans increased by million  which resulted in an increase of thousand in the allocated reserve 
unallocated reserves declined by thousand in as well as a decrease in reserves for impaired loans of million at december  nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans and leases and other real estate owned decreased to at december  from as of december   the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases decreased to at december  compared to at december  primarily due to the decline in nonaccrual loans and the related reserve 
management closely monitors the credit worthiness and the value of underlying collateral as a commercial credit becomes past due 
these factors along with historical and economic trends  and management s assumptions  are taken into consideration in providing the allowance for loan and lease losses 
when the loan becomes impaired and is placed on non accrual  a specific allowance is created for the impaired loan 
at december  the specific allowance on impaired loans was thousand  or of the balance of impaired loans of million 
at december  the specific allowance on impaired loans was million  or of the impaired loan balance of million 

table of contents allocated reserves in declined by thousand as higher allocations to account for growth in the lease financings portfolio were more than offset by lower reserves against declining indirect and commercial loan portfolios 
lease financings outstanding rose from million as of december  to million as of december  and the corresponding allocated reserves increased by thousand accordingly 
indirect loans outstanding declined from million to million  contributing to a homogeneous loan pool allocation reduction of thousand 
commercial loans including commercial real estate loans declined by million  having a downward impact on commercial loan allocations from a volume perspective  but this impact was negated by a higher proportion of loans in criticized loan pools  resulting in a net increase of thousand 
unallocated reserves declined by thousand in  a proportionately equivalent rate as the allocated reserve decline 
there was an increase in reserves for impaired loans of thousand 
although the balance of impaired loans declined to million at december  from million at december   the underlying value of the collateral and the borrowers individual abilities to pay down the principal balance on these loans required more of a reserve requirement on the balance 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans and leases and other real estate owned remained fairly level at and as of december  and  respectively  the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases remained fairly level at and at december  and  respectively 
management closely monitors the credit worthiness and the value of underlying collateral as a commercial credit becomes past due  these factors along with historical and economic trends  and management s assumptions  are taken into consideration in providing the allowance for loan and lease losses 
when the loan becomes impaired and is placed on non accrual  a specific allowance is created for the impaired loan 
at december  the specific allowance on impaired loans was million  or of the balance of impaired loans of million 
at december  the specific allowance on impaired loans was million  or of the impaired loan balance of million

the separate account boli will diversify the asset mix of the corporation and create additional economic performance 
liabilities the following table presents liabilities as of the dates indicated at december  change change deposits borrowings other liabilities total liabilities 
table of contents deposits total deposits decreased during primarily due to decreases in money market savings of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in regular savings of million and time deposits of million 
due to market conditions  there was a price advantage in overnight borrowings compared to money market and time deposit rates 
as a result  the corporation was willing to accept less deposit growth for the years ended december  compared to table deposits the following table summarizes the average amount of deposits for the periods indicated for the years ended december  noninterest bearing demand deposits interest bearing checking deposits money market savings regular savings time deposits total average deposits the following table summarizes the maturities of time deposits with balances of thousand or more at december  due three months due three to six due six to twelve due over twelve or less months months months time deposits borrowings long term debt increased million during as compared to primarily due to million of additional advances from the federal home loan bank primarily to fund the growth of univest capital 
this increase is partially offset by a reclassification of long term debt to short term debt in the amount of million due to the remaining term to maturity being one year or less

table of contents critical accounting policies management  in order to prepare the corporation s financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  is required to make estimates and assumptions that effect the amounts reported in the corporation s financial statements 
there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and assumptions 
certain critical accounting policies  discussed below  could materially affect the results of operations and financial position of the corporation should changes in circumstances require a change in related estimates or assumptions 
the corporation has identified the reserve for loan and lease losses  intangible assets  investment securities  mortgage servicing rights  income taxes  benefit plans and stock based compensation as areas with critical accounting policies 
reserve for loan and lease losses are provided using techniques that specifically identify losses on impaired loans and leases  estimate losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases  and estimate the amount of unallocated reserve necessary to account for losses that are present in the loan and lease portfolio but not yet currently identifiable 
the adequacies of these reserves are sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may affect the ability of borrowers to make contractual payments as well as the value of the collateral committed to secure such payments 
rapid or sustained downturns in the economy may require increases in reserves that may negatively impact the corporation s results of operation and statements of financial condition in the periods requiring additional reserves 
intangible assets have been recorded on the books of the corporation in connection with its acquisitions 
these assets  both identifiable and unidentifiable  are subject to tests for impairment 
changes in the useful life or economic value of acquired assets may require a reduction in the asset value carried on the financial statements of the corporation and a related charge in the statement of operations 
such changes in asset value could result from a change in market demand for the products or services offered by an acquired business or by reductions in the expected profit margins that can be obtained through the future delivery of the acquired product or service line 
the corporation designates its investment securities as held to maturity  available for sale or trading in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
each of these designations affords different treatment in the statement of operations and statement of financial condition for market value changes affecting securities that are otherwise identical 
should evidence emerge that indicates that management s intent or ability to manage the securities as originally asserted is not supportable  securities in the held to maturity or available for sale designations may be re categorized so that either statement of financial position or statement of operations adjustments may be required 
the corporation accounts for mortgage servicing rights for mortgages it originated but subsequently sold in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fas no 
as such  the value of the rights is booked as income when the corresponding mortgages are sold 
the income booked at sale is the estimated present value of the cash flows that will be received from servicing the loans over the entire future term 
the term of a servicing right can be reasonably estimated using prepayment assumptions of comparable assets priced in the secondary market 
as mortgage rates being offered to the public decrease  the life of loan servicing rights tends to shorten  as borrowers have increased incentive to refinance 
shortened loan servicing lives require a change in the value of the servicing rights that have already been recorded to be marked down in the statement of operations of the servicing company 
this may cause a material change in reported operations for the corporation depending on the size of the servicing portfolio and the degree of change in the prepayment speed of the type and coupon of loans being serviced 
the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities under the liability method of fas enacted tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on expected taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is anticipated to be realized 
future tax rate changes could occur that would require the recognition of income or expense in the statement of operations in the period in which they are enacted 
deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if in management s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized 

table of contents management may need to modify their judgments in this regard from one period to another should a material change occur in  the business environment  tax legislation  or in any other business factor that could impair the corporation s ability to benefit from the asset in the future 
the corporation has a retirement plan that it provides as a benefit to employees and former employees and supplemental retirement plans that it provides as a benefit to certain current and former executives 
determining the adequacy of the funding of these plans may require estimates of future salary rate increases  of long term rates of investment return  and the use of an appropriate discount rate for the obligation 
changes in these estimates and assumptions due to changes in the economic environment or financial markets may result in material changes in the corporation s results of operations or statement of financial condition 
the corporation follows sfas r  accounting for stock based compensation  in recording stock based compensation expense of stock options 
the corporation uses the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant 
the black scholes model estimates the fair value of employee stock options using a pricing model which takes into consideration the exercise price of the option  the expected life of the options  the current market price and its expected volatility  the expected dividends on the stock and the current risk free interest rate for the expected life of the option 
the corporation s estimate of the fair value of a stock option is based on expectations derived from historical experience and may not necessarily equate to its market value when fully vested 
readers of the corporation s financial statements should be aware that the estimates and assumptions used in the corporation s current financial statements may need to be updated in future financial presentations for changes in circumstances  business or economic conditions in order to fairly represent the condition of the corporation at that time 
asset liability management the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate earnings  capital and liquidity while maintaining an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet cash flow requirements of customers and corporate needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing rates 
the corporation uses both an interest sensitivity gap analysis and a simulation model to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk 
the corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short term rate exposures 
the corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the effect of declining or rising interest rates on the net interest margin over a one year horizon 
the simulation uses existing portfolio rate and repricing information  combined with assumptions regarding future loan and deposit growth  future spreads  prepayments on residential mortgages  and the discretionary pricing of non maturity assets and liabilities 
on december   the corporation entered into a million notional value interest rate swap  which has been classified as a cash flow hedge on million of trust preferred securities 
under the terms of the swap agreement  the corporation will pay a fixed rate of and receive a floating rate which is based on the three month us london interbank borrowing rate libor with a termination date of january  the corporation had used an interest rate swap agreement that converted a portion of its floating rate commercial loans to a fixed rate basis which matured in in this swap  the corporation agreed to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between the fixed and floating interest rates calculated on a agreed upon notional principal amount 
interest rate swaps in which the corporation pays a floating rate and receives a fixed rate are used to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the corporation s net income 
the impact of the interest rate swap on interest income for the year ended december  was a negative thousand 
at december  and  the corporation had no swaps outstanding 

table of contents credit risk extending credit exposes the corporation to credit risk  which is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan

the corporation focuses on both assessing the borrower s capacity and willingness to repay and on obtaining sufficient collateral 
commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by the borrower s assets and by personal guarantees 
commercial real estate loans are originated primarily within the eastern pennsylvania market area at conservative loan to value ratios and often by a guarantee of the borrowers 
management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that any credit concentrations by borrower or industry are closely monitored 
credit risk in the direct consumer loan portfolio  credit card portfolio and indirect auto loan portfolio is controlled by strict adherence to conservative underwriting standards that consider debt to income levels and the creditworthiness of the borrower and  if secured  collateral values 
in the home equity loan portfolio  combined loan to value ratios are generally limited to 
other credit considerations may warrant higher combined loan to value ratios and are generally insured by private mortgage insurance 
the corporation originates fixed rate and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans that are secured by the underlying to family residential properties 
credit risk exposure in this area of lending is minimized by the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower  including debt to equity ratios  credit scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan to value ratios of generally no more than 
residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan to value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance 
the corporation closely monitors delinquencies as another means of maintaining high asset quality 
collection efforts begin after a loan payment is missed  by attempting to contact all borrowers

while liquidation and recovery efforts continue  officers continue to work with the borrowers  if appropriate  to recover all monies owed to the corporation 
the corporation monitors delinquency trends and past due reports which are submitted to the board of directors 
liquidity the corporation  in its role as a financial intermediary  is exposed to certain liquidity risks 
liquidity refers to the corporation s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demand for loans and leases and deposit withdrawals 
the corporation manages its liquidity risk by measuring and monitoring its liquidity sources and estimated funding needs 
the corporation has a contingency funding plan in place to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial crisis 
sources of funds core deposits and cash management repurchase agreements repos have historically been the most significant funding sources for the corporation 
these deposits and repos are generated from a base of consumer  business and public customers primarily located in bucks and montgomery counties  pennsylvania 
the corporation faces increased competition for these deposits from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  security dealers and others 

table of contents the corporation supplements its core funding with money market funds it holds for the benefit of various trust accounts 
these funds are fully collateralized by the bank s investment portfolio and are at current money market mutual fund rates 
this funding source is subject to changes in the asset allocations of the trust accounts 
since august  the bank began purchasing certificates from plgit to augment its short term fixed funding sources 
the plgit deposits are public funds collateralized with a letter of credit that plgit maintains with the fhlb  therefore  univest national bank is not required to provide collateral on these deposits 
at december   the bank had million in plgit deposits 
the corporation  through the bank  has short term and long term credit facilities with the fhlb with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million

long term debt constitute the next largest payment obligation 
the bank anticipates meeting these obligations by continuing to provide convenient depository and cash management services through its branch network  thereby replacing these contractual obligations with similar fund sources at rates that are competitive in our market 
the table also shows the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
commitments to extend credit are the bank s most significant commitment in both the under and over one year time periods 
contractual obligations and commitments the corporation enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and its asset liability management  to fund acquisitions and to meet required capital needs 
these obligations require the corporation to make cash payments over time as detailed in the table below 
the corporation is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to manage the corporation s exposure to fluctuation in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby and commercial letters of credit and forward contracts 
these financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contract or notional amounts of these financial instruments reflect the extent of involvement the corporation has in particular classes of financial instruments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
in the course of its lending  leasing and deposit taking activities  the corporation is subject to changes in the economic value and or earnings potential of these assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates 
the corporation s asset liability management committee almc manages interest rate risk in a manner so as to provide adequate and reliable earnings 
this is accomplished through the establishment of policy limits on maximum risk exposures  as well as the regular and timely monitoring of reports designed to quantify risk and return levels 
the corporation uses both an interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and a simulation model to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk 
the corporation uses the gap analysis to identify and monitor long term rate exposure and uses a simulation model to measure the short term rate exposures 
the corporation runs various earnings simulation scenarios to quantify the effect of declining or rising interest rates on the net interest margin over a one year horizon 
the simulation uses existing portfolio rate and repricing information  combined with assumptions regarding future loan and deposit growth  future spreads  prepayments on residential mortgages  and the discretionary pricing of non maturity assets and liabilities 
the corporation is permitted to use interest rate swaps and interest rate caps floors with indices that correlate to on balance sheet instruments  to modify its indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on the corporation s current economic outlook 
at december   the simulation  based upon forward looking assumptions  projects that the corporation s greatest interest margin exposure to interest rate risk would occur if interest rates increased from present levels 
given the assumptions  a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve applied on a ramp up basis would cause the corporation s net interest margin  over a year horizon  to be approximately more than it would be if market rates would remain unchanged 
a basis point a basis point ramp down would not be relevant in the current market conditions parallel shift in the yield curve applied on a ramp down basis would cause the corporation s net interest margin  over a year horizon  to be approximately less than it would be if market rates would remain unchanged 
policy limits have been established which allow a tolerance for no more than approximately a negative impact to the interest margin resulting from a basis point parallel yield curve shift over a forward looking month period
