item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
liquidity and capital resources as of february   we had approximately million in available cash reserves  approximately million of convertible notes payable  and an average monthly cash burn rate during of approximately million a month 
the convertible notes payable have a stated maturity date of december   unless the maturity date is accelerated to any date after july  in response to the deteriorating credit markets and in an effort to extend the company s cash reserves as far into the future as possible  the company has enacted strict cost control measures in an effort to reduce monthly cash expenditures 
based on these recently enacted cost control measures  we anticipate that our cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements through the middle part of if the maturity of the convertible notes payable is not accelerated by the investors  we anticipate our cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements through late and perhaps into early we have historically been able to raise capital to continue with our research and development and it is likely that we will need to raise additional funds before we can generate enough revenue to become profitable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional funds

during the fourth quarter of  approximately of the investors in the private placements tendered payment demands to the company 
future capital requirements the extent and timing of our future capital requirements will depend primarily upon the rate of our progress in the development and commercialization of our technologies  including the successful implementation of our venture with fujairah oil technology and other third parties  and the timing of future customer orders 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and we incurred net losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these losses are principally associated with non cash stock compensation expense  legal defense costs and ongoing research and development of our sonocracking technology  including the development of prototypes  and related marketing activity 
although we expect to continue to incur similar expenses in the future  such expenditures will not include major construction projects until commercialization of our sonocracking technology 
operation and maintenance of the fujairah facility is the responsibility of fujairah oil technology llc fot and sulphco is responsible for contributing its sonocracking units 
the memorandum of association of fujairah oil technology  which defines certain rights of the joint venture partners  calls for profits and losses to be shared  with profits being distributed to the partners  subject to a reserve for legal expenses which may be waived by the partners 
sulphco s share of distributions made by the joint venture to sulphco will also be subject to other costs and expenses incurred directly by sulphco from time to time 
we expect that once the startup and operating plan for the fujairah facility is agreed  funding of direct expenditures  such as tank storage and pipelines  will be available from financing through fot 
for additional discussion regarding the fujairah facility see item business business development activities update above 
in addition to activities related to the fujairah facility  we intend to continue to incur additional expenditures during the next months for the continuous development and testing of sonocracker units 
to date  we have generated no material revenues from our business operations

these revenue streams may be generated by us or in conjunction with collaborative partners or third party licensing arrangements  and may include provisions for one time  lump sum payments in addition to ongoing royalty payments or other revenue sharing arrangements 
we presently have no binding commitments for any such revenues 
future revenues and profits from fot are dependent upon the successful implementation of our sonocracking technology 
other possible sources of additional capital include the exercise of the remaining warrants issued to investors in conjunction with financing transactions in march  november and may  and funding through sales of the company s common stock under the equity line of credit with azimuth  future collaborative arrangements  licensing arrangements and debt and equity financings 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms when needed 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms when needed  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our technologies  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to unanticipated requirements 
if we are unable to secure such additional financing when needed  we may have to curtail or suspend all or a portion of our business activities 
further  if we issue additional equity securities  our shareholders may experience severe dilution of their ownership percentage

on march   the company executed amendment no 
to securities purchase agreements and warrants amendment no 
with certain warrant holders the warrant holders who had been issued warrants by the company in warrants  and holders of warrants  warrant holders and in warrants  and holders of warrants  warrant holders that provided inducements to encourage the warrant holders to exercise their respective warrants 
as consideration for warrant holders exercising their respective warrants  the company agreed that it would reduce the exercise price on warrants to acquire  shares of the company s common stock held by the warrant holders from per share to per share  and issue the warrant holders additional warrants  with an exercise price of per share  on a one to one basis for each existing warrant that was exercised including granting up to  warrants to the warrant holders and up to  warrants to the warrant holders

described above  during the quarter ended march    warrants held by the warrant holders and  warrants held by the warrant holders were exercised resulting in the grant of  additional warrants the march warrants 
as a result of the inducements  the company recorded a non cash deemed dividend of approximately million 
the amount of the deemed dividend was estimated to be equal to the sum of the fair value of the inducements as the sum of the incremental fair value conveyed to the warrant holders by the reduction of the exercise price of the warrants determined as provided in paragraph of sfas r utilizing the black scholes valuation model and the fair value of the  march warrants estimated using the black scholes valuation model

as a result of the inducement described above  of the march warrants held by the warrant holders were exercised in november resulting in a grant of  additional warrants the november warrants

contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years convertible notes payable operating lease obligations total new accounting pronouncements  significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates new accounting pronouncements and significant accounting policies see note to our financial statements 
critical accounting estimates we make a number of estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements 
these estimates can differ from actual results and have a significant impact on our recorded assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an estimate to be a critical accounting estimate if it requires a high level of subjectivity or judgment and a significant change in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews each critical accounting estimate with our senior management 
further discussion of these accounting policies and estimates is in the notes to our financial statements 
loss contingencies we record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we consider loss contingency estimates to be critical accounting estimates because they entail significant judgment regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure  and the ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
see note to our financial statements for additional information 
stock based compensation the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under sfas r  the company is required to recognize  as expense  the estimated fair value of all share based payments to employees 
the fair value of each option award granted under the company s stock plans is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected term of options granted to employees is derived utilizing the simplified method referred to in sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab no 
which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the company utilizes the simplified method because it does not have historical exercise data which is sufficient to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 
the company expects to continue utilizing the simplified method to determine the expected term until such time as it accumulates historical exercise data that will provide a sufficient basis for the company to begin estimating the expected term for option exercises 
the expected term of options granted to non employees is equal to the contractual term of the option as required by other accounting literature 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant 
see note to our financial statements for additional information 
deferred tax assets  valuation allowances and tax liabilities we estimate a income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  b net deferred tax assets and liabilities based on expected future taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  c valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and d uncertain income tax positions 
these estimates are considered critical accounting estimates because they require projecting future operating results which is inherently imprecise and judgments related to the ultimate determination of tax positions by taxing authorities 
also  these estimates depend on assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible 
see note to our financial statements for additional information 
we assess our future ability to use federal  state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards  capital loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets using the more likely than not criteria 
these assessments include an evaluation of our recent history of earnings and losses  future reversals of temporary differences and identification of other sources of future taxable income  including the identification of tax planning strategies in certain situations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider our exposure to market risks to be immaterial 
although there is market risk involving changes in the interest rates which apply to our convertible notes payable and our cash investments  such risk is minor 
our risk related to foreign currency fluctuations is not material at this time  as any accounts payable we may have in foreign denominations are not in themselves material 
as of december   the company had variable rate convertible notes payable totaling  this variable rate debt exposes the company to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in near term interest rates 
if the variable interest rate were to increase by from december levels  interest expense would increase by approximately  annually 
the carrying value of the variable rate convertible notes payable  excluding the discount relating to the beneficial conversion feature  approximates fair value as it bears interest at current market rates that reset on a quarterly basis 
as we anticipate needing to use the cash we held at year end within a short period  we have it invested primarily in money market accounts 
the amount of fluctuation in interest rates will not expose us to any significant risk due to market fluctuation as the interest on our note payable would likely decrease by a greater amount
