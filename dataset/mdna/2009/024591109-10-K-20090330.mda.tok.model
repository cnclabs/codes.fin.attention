item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as noted elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including under risk factors in item a and liquidity and capital resources abi and non debtor subsidiaries in this item  the company is negotiating with its current lenders to obtain an amendment or waiver to address certain financial covenants under its existing principal credit agreement which the company expects it would not comply with for the period ended march  and subsequent periods 
the company is negotiating to obtain alternative financing to replace that credit agreement  including the term loan and credit facility included as part of that credit agreement 
the credit facility under that credit agreement expires on september  the company s independent registered public accountant has issued an opinion on the company s consolidated financial statements that states that the consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern and further states that the company s need to refinance its credit facility raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
if the company is unable to obtain such an amendment or waiver or to obtain alternative financing on satisfactory terms  the company may not be able to continue as a going concern 
global and financial markets have recently been experiencing substantial disruption 
economic conditions in the united states have been challenging  including in the industries in which the company and congoleum conduct business 
the downturn in the housing industry has resulted in reduced demand for the company s and congoleum s products 
the slowdown in manufacturing  including in the automotive and industrial sectors  has resulted in reduced demand for the tape division s products 
in addition  the decline in consumer and retailer  especially mid tier retailer  spending has resulted in reduced demand for k m s products 
forecasts generally call for a slowing economy and an economic recession in the united states  including in the industries in which the company and congoleum conduct business 
the company expects the current and forecasted economic conditions to continue to negatively impact the company s and congoleum s businesses and operations and that the extent of that impact will depend on the duration and depth of the economic slowdown or recession 
in addition  raw material and energy costs increased sharply over the past year  particularly during the first half of  which has negatively impacted the company s and congoleum s businesses and operating results 
although raw material and energy costs have recently declined  it is not known whether raw material and energy prices will remain lower or will revert to increasing price levels 
in light of the current and forecasted economic conditions in the united states and the industries in which the company and congoleum conduct business  the company and congoleum may be unable to pass increased raw material and energy costs on to their respective customers 
although the company and congoleum intend to implement reductions in their expenses  there can be no assurance that they will be able to reduce their respective expenses  that any reductions they may implement will have any meaningful positive impact on their businesses  results of operations or financial condition  or that they will be able to sustain any expense reductions that they may implement 
american biltrite s consolidated financial statements include its majority owned subsidiary  congoleum 
however  under the terms of the amended joint plan  abi s ownership interest in congoleum would be eliminated 
abi expects its ownership interest in congoleum to be eliminated under any alternate plan or outcome in congoleum s chapter case 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court seeking relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code as a means to resolve claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
during  congoleum had obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of a proposed  pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
in january  congoleum filed its proposed joint plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
from that filing through  several subsequent plans were negotiated with representatives of the acc  the fcr and other asbestos claimant representatives 
in addition  an insurance company  cna  filed a plan of reorganization and the bondholders committee also filed a plan of reorganization 
in may  the bankruptcy court ordered the principal parties in interest in congoleum s reorganization proceedings to participate in reorganization plan mediation discussions 
several mediation sessions took place during  culminating in two competing plans  one which congoleum filed jointly with the acc in september and the other filed by cna  both of which the bankruptcy court subsequently ruled were not confirmable as a matter of law 
in march  congoleum resumed global plan mediation discussions with the various parties seeking to resolve the issues raised in the bankruptcy court s ruling with respect to the tenth plan 
in july  the fcr filed a plan of reorganization and proposed disclosure statement 
after extensive further mediation sessions  on february   the fcr  the acc  the bondholders committee and congoleum jointly filed the joint plan 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement for the joint plan in february  and the joint plan was solicited in accordance with court approved voting procedures 
various objections to the joint plan were filed  and on may  the bankruptcy court heard oral argument on summary judgment motions relating to certain of those objections 
on june   the bankruptcy court issued a ruling that the joint plan was not legally confirmable  and issued an order to show cause why the case should not be converted or dismissed pursuant to usc following a further hearing on june   the bankruptcy court issued an opinion that vacated the order to show cause and instructed the parties to submit a confirmable plan by the end of calendar year following further negotiations  the bondholders committee  the acc  the fcr  representatives of holders of pre petition settlements and congoleum reached an agreement in principle which the company understands that congoleum believed addressed the issues raised by the bankruptcy court in the ruling on the joint plan and in the court s prior decisions 
a term sheet describing the proposed material terms of the amended joint plan and the litigation settlement was entered into by those parties and was filed with the bankruptcy court on august  certain insurers and a large bondholder have filed objections to the litigation settlement and or reserved their rights to object to confirmation of the amended joint plan 
the bankruptcy court approved the litigation settlement following a hearing on october   but the court reserved certain issues  including whether any plan of reorganization embodying the settlement meets the standards required for confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
on november   congoleum  the acc and the bondholders committee filed an amended joint plan of reorganization for congoleum  et al 
with the bankruptcy court the amended joint plan 
in january  an insurer filed a motion for summary judgment seeking denial of confirmation of the amended joint plan  and a hearing was held on february  on february   the bankruptcy court rendered an opinion denying confirmation of the amended joint plan 
pursuant to the opinion  the bankruptcy court entered the order of dismissal dismissing congoleum s bankruptcy case 
on february   congoleum and the bondholders committee appealed the order of dismissal to the us district court for the district of new jersey 
on march   an order was entered by the bankruptcy court granting a stay of the bankruptcy court s order of dismissal pending a final non appealable decision affirming the order of dismissal 
there can be no assurance that the appeal of the order of dismissal will be granted by the district court or any other court which may be appealed to or that the bankruptcy court will not subsequently vacate its grant of a stay of its order of dismissal 
if the appeal were denied  congoleum s bankruptcy case could be dismissed  resulting in congoleum no longer benefiting from the protection from creditor claims currently afforded to it by the chapter case and the bankruptcy code 
further  as indicated in the order of dismissal  congoleum s ability to refile another bankruptcy petition may be limited  which could result in congoleum having to attempt to conduct its business and operations outside of the protections of the bankruptcy code  including attempting to defend against  satisfy or defray its creditor claims  such as its substantial asbestos liabilities and its senior notes  and continued litigation against its insurers to attempt to obtain insurance coverage for congoleum s asbestos liabilities 
it is unclear what effect the order of dismissal  the stay of the bankruptcy court s order of dismissal pending a final non appealable decision affirming the order of dismissal and the continued litigation may have on congoleum s business and operations  including with regard to its relationships with its vendors  suppliers  customers  lenders and other constituencies 
even if the appeal of the order of dismissal is successful for congoleum  there can be no assurance that the amended joint plan or any other plan will receive the acceptances necessary for confirmation  that the amended joint plan will not be modified further  that the conditions to the amended joint plan or any other plan will be satisfied or waived  that the amended joint plan or any other plan will timely receive necessary court approvals from the bankruptcy court and the united states district court for the district of new jersey  that the amended joint plan or any other plan will be confirmed  that the amended joint plan or any other plan  if confirmed  will become effective  or that congoleum will have sufficient funds to pay for completion of the appellate process with respect to the amended joint plan  continued litigation over any plan of reorganization and the state court coverage litigation 
any other plan of reorganization that may be proposed for congoleum may contain terms substantially different from those contained in the amended joint plan 
abi estimates that it will spend an additional thousand for legal fees in  which it has accrued  in connection with congoleum s reorganization plan 
actual costs for pursuing and implementing the amended joint plan or any plan of reorganization could be materially higher  and congoleum and the company may record significant additional charges should the minimum estimated cost increase 
in addition  abi is also a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits in addition to those brought against congoleum 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
these matters could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
during  the company decided to discontinue the operations of its janus flooring corporation subsidiary  a manufacturer of pre finished hardwood flooring  and sell the related assets 
results of janus flooring  including charges resulting from the shutdown  are being reported as a discontinued operation 
during  the remaining assets of janus flooring were sold  and the discontinued operation was effectively dissolved 
as of december   the company merged janus flooring with and into american biltrite canada ltd 
due to congoleum s reorganization and separate capital structure  as well as the anticipated elimination of abi s ownership interest in congoleum  the company believes that presenting the results of operations of abi and its non debtor subsidiaries separately from those of congoleum is the most meaningful way to discuss and analyze its financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations abi and non debtor subsidiaries in thousands of dollars net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses impairment charges loss from operations interest expense  net other income  net loss before taxes and other items benefit from income taxes noncontrolling interests loss from continuing operations net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from sales of million in tape segment sales decreased million or due to lower sales volume of transfer paper  protective films and hvac products  partly offset by million in selling price increases 
canadian segment sales increased million or due to improved industrial product sales 
jewelry segment sales decreased million or due to lower shipments to mass merchandiser and mid tier retailers  reflecting the weak retail environment 
gross profit was of net sales in compared to in tape segment gross margins declined by percentage points of net sales primarily due to significant inflation on raw materials  particularly during the first half of  and the impact of lower production volumes  partly offset by price increases 
canadian division gross margins improved by percentage points of net sales due to improved margins on industrial products resulting from price increases  a more profitable sales mix of flooring products  and the effect of the weaker canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in the fourth quarter of jewelry segment margins decreased by percentage points of net sales due to increases in landed costs  higher selling allowances and higher royalty costs resulting from more licensed products in the sales mix 
the company includes the cost of purchasing and finished goods inspection in selling  general and administrative expenses 
some companies also record such costs in operating expenses while others record them in cost of goods sold 
consequently  the company s gross profit margins may not be comparable to other companies 
had the company recorded these expenses in cost of sales  the gross profit margins for the years ended december  and would have been and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  down from million in tape division selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million due to lower sales related expenses and savings from headcount reductions  partly offset by severance costs and the impact of currency translation 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million at canadian division mainly due to higher salaries and travel expenses related to personnel changes 
jewelry segment selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million from to primarily due to headcount reduction programs and other expense cuts 
in addition  corporate expenses not allocated to operations were significantly lower in than due to lower net provisions for environmental and other contingent liabilities 
during  the company evaluated the recovery of goodwill and certain other capitalized intangibles related to the jewelry segment in light of that segment s recent operating performance  the economic environment  and market value conditions for similar businesses 
based on that evaluation  a non cash impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of which wrote off all goodwill and capitalized intangibles of the company 
the company also evaluated the recovery of its investment in hulera sula in light of hulera sula s operating losses for and a non cash impairment charge of thousand was recorded to write off the company s investment in hulera sula 
net interest expense of million for was down million as a result of lower debt levels as well as lower interest rates 
other income decreased from million in to million in as a result of expenses related to certain interest rate swap agreements  including costs to terminate those agreements in the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate is due primarily to the increase in valuation allowance against net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets  which may not be recovered by abi in future periods due to the uncertainty in abi s ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
the company incurred a loss of million from continuing operations for compared with a loss of million in as a result of the million non cash impairment charge in coupled with weaker operating results at two of the three divisions

the decrease in sales resulted primarily from lower sales to the manufactured housing industry coupled with continued demand weakness in the new construction and remodeling markets  partially offset by price increases instituted during gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales for the year ended december  sharp increases in raw material costs during the year of net sales  coupled with the negative impact of lower production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead of net sales accounted for the decline in gross margin dollars and percentage  partially offset by cost reduction programs implemented during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily driven by lower wages and benefits expense down million  reflecting workforce reductions instituted in  coupled with reductions in other selling  general and administrative expenses 
based on the terms of the amended joint plan  in the third quarter of congoleum recorded an additional million provision for estimated costs for the reorganization proceedings 
in the fourth quarter of congoleum recorded an additional million charge 
of this charge  million related to the write off of certain insurance litigation costs receivable that would not have been collected under the terms of the amended joint plan and million was an additional provision for estimated costs for the reorganization proceedings and the coverage action 
loss from operations  excluding the special charges above  was million for the year ended december  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this change in operating income was a result of lower sales  coupled with the unfavorable impact of raw material costs and lower production volumes on gross profit  partially offset by lower operating expenses 
interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense  excluding interest on the senior notes  for  was million as compared to interest expense of million for bond interest reversal on the senior notes in was million 
benefit for income taxes was million in and a provision of million in  reflecting an increase in non deductible expenses for tax purposes in liquidity and capital resources abi and non debtor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments  decreased by thousand to million at december  as compared to december  total debt at december  was million  down million from december  working capital at december  was million  compared with million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was compared to at december  the decreases in working capital and ratio of current assets to current liabilities is due in part to the classification of abi s term loan million entirely as a current liability as of december  see below for further discussion of the company s financing 
net cash used by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was million compared with cash provided of million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a million increase in inventory during compared with a decrease in inventory of million in  as well as more cash used to settle payables and accrued liabilities in versus  partly offset by reductions in accounts receivable levels 
capital expenditures for were million compared to million for the company has recorded provisions which it believes are adequate for environmental remediation  including provisions for testing and potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities  and non asbestos product related liabilities 
while the company believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  that most of such amounts will be paid over a period of one to ten years and that the company expects to have sufficient resources to fund such amounts  the actual timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from the company s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on the company s costs  the company is not aware of any pending legislation or regulation relating to these matters that would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
there can be no assurances that any such costs could be passed along to its customers

the formula used for determining the domestic borrowing base is based upon inventory  receivables and fixed assets of the company and certain of its subsidiaries not including  among others  ab canada and congoleum  reduced by amounts outstanding under the term loan 
the amount of borrowings available from time to time for ab canada under the canadian revolver is limited to the lesser of a million less any outstanding borrowings under the canadian letter of credit facility  b ab canada s borrowing base amount  which is based upon ab canada s accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and c million less the amount of domestic borrowings outstanding under the revolver on behalf of the company and k m

the term loan principal is payable in quarterly installments of thousand beginning december  and ending on september  all indebtedness under the credit agreement  other than the term loan  is due on september  the credit agreement contains certain covenants that the company must satisfy 
the covenants included in the credit agreement include certain financial tests  restrictions on the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness or to grant liens on its assets and restrictions on the ability of the company to pay dividends on its capital stock 
the financial tests are required to be calculated based on the company accounting for its majority owned subsidiary congoleum on the equity method and include a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  a minimum ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda less certain cash payments for taxes  debt service  and dividends to interest expense  a minimum level of tangible net worth  and a maximum level of capital spending 
pursuant to the amendment and restatement to the credit agreement entered into on september   certain of the financial covenants under the credit agreement were amended to  among other things  i increase the permitted ratio of the company s consolidated total liabilities to consolidated tangible net worth to  ii to provide for a higher threshold for satisfying the consolidated tangible net worth test and iii to provide a higher permitted aggregate amount for capital expenditures in any fiscal year 
the credit agreement also requires  for each fiscal quarter ending on and after september   the company s consolidated adjusted ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ending to exceed of the company s consolidated fixed charges for the month period ending on such date  as determined under the credit agreement 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the company and certain of its subsidiaries previously granted bofa and the canadian lender a security interest in most of the company s and its subsidiaries assets 
the security interest granted does not include shares of capital stock of congoleum or the assets of congoleum 
in addition  pursuant to the credit agreement  certain of the company s subsidiaries have agreed to guarantee the company s obligations excluding ab canada s obligations under the credit agreement 
in the past  the company has had to amend its debt agreements in order to avoid being in default of those agreements as a result of failing to satisfy certain financial covenants contained in those agreements 
at march   the company was not in compliance with the financial covenant under the credit agreement that there be no consecutive quarterly net losses from continuing operations 
on may   american biltrite inc and its subsidiaries  k m and ab canada  entered into an amendment  effective as of march   to the credit agreement with bofa and bofa acting through its canada branch  each in their respective capacities as lenders and administrative agents under the credit agreement 
the amendment revised that financial covenant to provide that for each of the two consecutive fiscal quarters of the company ending december  and march   the company may not have a quarterly net loss from continuing operations in excess of thousand 
the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of its debt agreements at june and september  at december   the company was not in compliance with the financial covenant under the credit agreement that requires a ratio of adjusted ebitda to consolidated interest expense as such terms are defined in the credit agreement to exceed and that there be no consecutive quarterly net losses from continuing operations 
on march   american biltrite inc and its subsidiaries  k m and ab canada  entered into an amendment  effective as of december   to the credit agreement with bofa and bofa acting through its canada branch  each in their respective capacities as lenders and administrative agents under the credit agreement 
the amendment removed the financial covenant that required the company not to have any consecutive quarterly net losses from continuing operations 
in addition  for purposes of determining the company s compliance with the financial covenant requiring its consolidated adjusted ebitda to exceed of the company s consolidated fixed charges in each case  as determined under the credit agreement  the amendment permits the company to add certain amounts to its consolidated adjusted ebitda to the extent those amounts are deducted in determining the company s consolidated net income as determined under the credit agreement 
further  under that amendment  the lenders waived defaults that may have otherwise existed as of december  with respect to the financial covenants that were amended by the amendment 
as of december   american biltrite was in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit agreement as amended by the may  amendment 
abi paid bofa a fee of thousand in connection with this amendment 
the company does not anticipate it will meet the covenant with respect to the ratio of consolidated adjusted ebitda to consolidated fixed charges for the period ended march  and subsequent periods 
as a result  the company is currently negotiating with its lenders to amend the credit agreement to address  or obtain a waiver for  any such breaches 
the credit facility under the credit agreement expires september  and will have to be extended  refinanced or replaced by that expiration date or any earlier time required by any waiver or amendment the company may obtain or enter into to address the expected covenant breaches under the credit agreement 
although the company currently anticipates that it will be able to obtain a waiver or enter an amendment to address these matters  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in this regard 
further  any waiver or amendment the company may obtain is expected to be limited in scope and duration such that the company would likely need to obtain further amendments or waivers in the future or obtain alternative financing 
based on the company s anticipated covenant breaches  the company has classified the entire outstanding balance of the term loan million as a current liability at december  the company is also currently negotiating for alternative financing to replace the credit agreement  including the term loan and the revolver 
the company believes it will be successful in obtaining alternative financing during the second quarter of  and that the replacement facility contemplated would provide the company with sufficient financing on commercially reasonable terms for an extended period of time 
it is possible  however  that the company may not be successful in obtaining the alternative financing it is currently seeking and it may not be able to obtain financing from other alternative sources or under a different arrangement with its existing lenders 
failure to obtain adequate financing on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
any required amendments or replacement financing  if obtained  could result in significant cost to the company 
if an event of default under the credit agreement were to occur  the lenders could cease to make borrowings available under the revolver and require the company to repay all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
if the company were unable to repay those amounts due  the lenders could have their rights over the collateral most of the company s and its subsidiaries excluding congoleum assets  as applicable exercised  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
under the terms of the amended joint plan  abi s ownership interest in congoleum would be eliminated 
abi expects that its ownership interest in congoleum would be eliminated under any alternate plan or outcome in congoleum s chapter case 
while the company does not believe the loss of the value of its equity interest in congoleum would have a direct material adverse effect on abi s liquidity  the loss of a controlling interest could have a material adverse impact on the business relationships between abi and congoleum  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on abi s business  operations and financial condition 
in connection with congoleum s plan of reorganization  abi expects to spend thousand in  which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on abi s working capital or cash flow 
the company has not declared a dividend subsequent to the third quarter of future dividends  if any  will be determined by the company s board of directors based upon the financial performance and capital requirements of the company  among other considerations 
under the credit agreement  aggregate dividend payments since june  are generally limited to of cumulative consolidated net income computed treating congoleum under the equity method of accounting  as determined under the credit agreement  earned from june  liquidity and capital resources congoleum the consolidated financial statements of congoleum  which are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  have been prepared on a going concern basis 
a going concern basis contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements of congoleum do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should congoleum be unable to continue as a going concern 
as described more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  there is substantial doubt about congoleum s ability to continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabilities through a successful reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court case no 
seeking relief under the bankruptcy code 
see elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are set forth in item of this annual report on form k  for a discussion of congoleum s bankruptcy proceedings 
these matters continue to have a material adverse impact on liquidity and capital resources 
during  congoleum paid million in fees and expenses related to reorganization proceedings under the bankruptcy code and the new jersey state court insurance coverage action congoleum is litigating against certain of its insurers the coverage action 
furthermore  at december   congoleum had incurred but not paid approximately million in additional fees and expenses for services rendered through that date 
based on its reorganization plans  congoleum has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum estimated cost to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through confirmation of a plan that complies with section g of the bankruptcy code 
congoleum recorded charges aggregating approximately million in years prior to based on the terms of the joint plan  in the fourth quarter of congoleum recorded an additional million charge 
of this charge  million related to the write off of certain insurance litigation costs receivable that would not have been collected under the terms of the joint plan and are not expected to be collected under any future plan  including the amended joint plan  and million was an additional provision for estimated costs for the reorganization proceedings and the coverage action 
in the fourth quarter of congoleum also recorded a million interest expense credit to reverse post petition interest accrued on its senior notes 
terms of previous reorganization plans had provided  among other things  for the payment of post petition interest on the senior notes and therefore congoleum had continued to accrue such interest 
under the terms of the amended joint plan  and the expected terms of any future plan  including the amended joint plan  the senior note holders would not have received any post petition interest 
following the ruling that the amended joint plan was unconfirmable and based on the anticipated terms and timing of effectiveness of any plan of reorganization for congoleum  congoleum recorded an additional charge of million in the third quarter of for costs to effect its reorganization 
in february  the bankruptcy court ordered congoleum s former counsel  gilbert  heintz randolph llp currently known as gilbert oshinsky llp ghr to disgorge all fees and certain expenses it was paid by congoleum 
in october  congoleum and ghr entered into a settlement agreement under which ghr was to pay congoleum approximately million plus accrued interest in full satisfaction of the disgorgement order 
the obligation was secured by assets of ghr and was to be made over time according to a formula based on ghr s earnings 
the bankruptcy court approved that settlement agreement in april congoleum received million plus million of accrued interest in full satisfaction of that settlement agreement in march unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  a decrease of million from december  under the terms of its revolving credit agreement  payments on congoleum s accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by congoleum to its lender and the funds in that account are used by the lender to pay down any loan balance 
there were no funds deposited in this account at december  and december  additionally  million remaining from a million settlement received in august from an insurance carrier  which is subject to a court order  is included as restricted cash at december  in the second quarter of congoleum received an additional million from other insurance carriers which is also included in restricted cash 
congoleum expects to contribute these funds  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the plan trust that would be established upon effectiveness of the plan of reorganization should the bankruptcy court confirm such a plan pursuant to section g of the bankruptcy code the plan trust 
net working capital was a negative million at december   down from million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  and to at december  net cash used in operations during for the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash provided by operations of million during the year ended december  capital expenditures in totaled million 
congoleum is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between million and million in  primarily for maintenance and improvement of plants and equipment  which congoleum expects to fund with cash from operations and credit facilities 
in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing agreement as amended and approved by the bankruptcy court to date provides a revolving credit facility expiring on the earlier of i june  and ii the date the plan of reorganization in congoleum s bankruptcy cases as confirmed by the bankruptcy court becomes effective 
total borrowing under the facility may not exceed million 
interest is based on above the prime rate 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants  which include the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
in connection with the amendment and extension of the agreement during  the minimum level of ebitda that congoleum must maintain was reduced for quarters ending after june  congoleum paid a fee of thousand for such amendment  plus an amendment fee in the amount of thousand per month 
the financing agreement also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financing agreement must be met in order for congoleum to borrow from the facility 
congoleum was not in compliance with the minimum ebitda covenant under its credit facility for the period ended december   and obtained a waiver of that covenant as well as an amendment of the covenant levels for the remaining term of the facility to make them less restrictive 
the interest rate was increased to above the prime rate 
a fee of thousand was paid in connection with the waiver and amendment 
borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  million was available under the facility  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
congoleum anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility including anticipated extensions beyond june  together with cash from operations will provide it with sufficient liquidity to operate during while under chapter protection 
there can be no assurances that congoleum will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants under this facility or that the debtor in possession facility as extended will be renewed prior to its expiration if a plan of reorganization is not confirmed before that time 
for a plan of reorganization to be confirmed  congoleum will need to obtain and demonstrate the sufficiency of exit financing 
congoleum cannot presently determine the terms of such financing  nor can there be any assurances of its success obtaining it 
in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  congoleum has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
congoleum is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against congoleum 
among these claims  congoleum is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of congoleum s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of congoleum s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
congoleum has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while congoleum believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from congoleum s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on congoleum s costs  congoleum is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against congoleum 
congoleum s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
congoleum believes that its existing cash including restricted cash  cash generated from operations  and debtor in possession credit arrangements should be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for operations during congoleum s ability to emerge from chapter will depend on obtaining sufficient exit financing to settle administrative expenses of the reorganization and any other related obligations  and to provide adequate future liquidity 
as noted elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the bankruptcy court has issued an order of dismissal and the appeal of that order that is currently being pursued may not be successful 
there can be no assurance that congoleum s bankruptcy case will not be dismissed or converted or that a plan of reorganization for congoleum will be approved  confirmed and become effective on terms consistent with the amended joint plan or otherwise 
contingencies abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its consolidated financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results and conditions may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
asbestos liabilities as discussed previously  the company is party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from their previous manufacture of asbestos containing products 
abi has recorded in its consolidated balance sheet a liability and corresponding insurance receivable based on its estimates of the future costs and related insurance recoveries to settle asbestos litigation 
these estimates are based on a number of subjective assumptions  including the anticipated costs to settle claims  the claims dismissal rate  the cost to litigate claims  the number of claims expected to be received  and the applicability and allocation of insurance coverage to these costs 
additionally  due to the numerous uncertainties related to future asbestos litigation trends and costs  the company does not believe reasonable estimates can be developed for claim developments beyond a six year horizon 
accordingly  the company s estimated liability is based on claims currently filed as well as claims anticipated to be filed over the next six years 
a change in assumptions could have a material effect on the company s estimated liability 
for example  it is estimated that a percentage point increase in the company s acceptance rate of mesothelioma claims results in a increase in mesothelioma liability assuming all other variables remained constant 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  the company has estimated a wide range of potential future costs and insurance recoveries and  because management believes that no amount within the range is more likely than any other  has recorded a liability and insurance receivable based on the low end of the range in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  the selection of a different amount within the range could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as could future developments  which may differ from those assumed in developing the company s estimates 
the same factors that affect developing forecasts of potential indemnity costs for asbestos related liabilities also affect estimates of the total amount of insurance that is probable of recovery  as do a number of additional factors 
these additional factors include the financial viability of some of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies  how legal and other loss handling costs will be covered by the insurance policies  and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships 
the company analyzes these estimates on an annual basis and reassesses the assumptions used as additional information becomes available over the course of time 
congoleum is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products 
during  congoleum paid million net of recoveries in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code and litigation with certain insurance companies 
given the terms of the proposed amended joint plan  congoleum has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum estimated cost to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through confirmation of a plan that complies with section g of the bankruptcy code 
in anticipation of congoleum s commencement of the chapter cases  congoleum entered into a claimant agreement  which provides for settlement of certain prepetition asbestos claims against congoleum and provides for an aggregate settlement value of at least million as well as an additional number of individually negotiated trial listed settlements with an aggregate value of approximately million  for total settlements in excess of million 
participants in the claimant agreement signed releases limiting their recourse against congoleum to what they would receive from the plan trust and congoleum has therefore estimated its liability under the claimant agreement as the cost of effecting the settlement through confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
in addition  as a result of tabulating ballots on a previous plan  congoleum is also aware of claims by claimants whose claims were not determined under the claimant agreement but who have submitted claims with a value of approximately million based on the settlement values applicable in a previous plan 
it is also likely that additional new claims may be asserted in connection with solicitation of acceptances of any future plan 
congoleum does not believe it can reasonably estimate the liability associated with claims that may be pending 
abi understands that congoleum expects that insurance will provide the substantial majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of congoleum itself 
congoleum believes it has insufficient limited financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
while congoleum has provided for the anticipated costs to effect the amended joint plan  costs for pursuing and implementing the amended joint plan and any plan of reorganization could be materially higher than recorded amounts and previous estimates 
congoleum will update its estimates  if appropriate  as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  which could result in potentially material adjustments to congoleum s earnings in future periods 
consolidation of congoleum the company s subsidiary congoleum filed for bankruptcy protection on december  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results for congoleum for all periods presented 
abi expects to continue to own a majority of the voting stock of congoleum until congoleum s reorganization proceedings are concluded 
upon effectiveness of any plan of reorganization for congoleum  abi expects that the plan will provide that abi s shares of congoleum will be cancelled 
the company has elected to continue to consolidate the financial statements of congoleum in its consolidated results because it believes that is the appropriate presentation given its current voting control of congoleum 
however  the accompanying financial statements also present the details of consolidation to separately show the financial condition  operating results and cash flows of abi including its non debtor subsidiaries and congoleum  which may be more meaningful for certain analyses 
abi s reported consolidated financial condition  operating results and cash flows results would be materially different if they did not include congoleum 
the company anticipates its equity interest in congoleum will be eliminated in connection with the effectiveness of any future congoleum plan of reorganization  at which time it will no longer include congoleum in the company s consolidated financial statements 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
the company accrues for its estimate of future remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including the extent of clean up activities to be performed  the methods employed in the clean up activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
for sites with multiple potentially responsible parties  the company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage or payment from third parties  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the expected recovery 
a receivable reserve is recorded when recoveries are disputed or are not highly probable 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
the company closely monitors existing and potential environmental matters to consider the reasonableness of its estimates and assumptions 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies  and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize as anticipated in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances  or to reduce previously recorded valuation allowances 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of the company s employees 
the company also maintains health and life insurance programs for retirees 
benefits under the plans are based on years of service and employee compensation 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management 
other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
in and  the company assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past actuarial gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is used to determine expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of the related receivables  including the length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances where the company is made aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously noted 
the remainder of the reserve is based on management s estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of the company s customer base 
the risk associated with this estimate is that the company would not become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  the company s estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and the company has processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
inventory allowances the company maintains obsolescence and slow moving allowances for inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
the remainder of the allowance is based on management s estimates and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
management closely monitors the market place and related inventory levels and has historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  the company values certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is maintained to properly value these inventories
