item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our consolidated financial statements are not directly comparable from period to period because of our acquisition and disposition of selected assets of radio stations and our acquisitions of non broadcast businesses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under item for additional information 
overview as a radio broadcasting company with a national radio network  we derive our broadcast revenue primarily from the sale of broadcast time and radio advertising on a national and local basis 
historically  our principal sources of revenue have been the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
the rates we are able to charge for broadcast time and advertising time are dependent upon several factors  including audience share  how well our stations perform for our clients  the size of the market  the general economic conditions in each market  and supply and demand on both a local and national level 
our sources of revenue and product offerings also increasingly include non broadcast businesses  including our internet and publishing businesses 
the following table shows the percentage of net broadcast revenue for each broadcast revenue source 
year ended december  dollars in thousands block program time national local advertising national local infomercials network other net broadcast revenue our broadcast revenue is affected primarily by the program rates our radio stations charge  the level of broadcast air time sold and by the advertising rates our radio stations and networks charge 
the rates for block programming time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and networks ability to produce results for their advertisers 
we do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for our christian teaching and talk stations 
instead  we have marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audiences 
in selected markets we do subscribe to arbitron  which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre determined level of time that they make available for block programming and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
arbitron has developed new technology to collect data for its ratings service 
the portable people meter tm ppm tm is a small  pager sized device that does not require active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
this service is already in a number of our markets and is scheduled to be introduced more markets in the future 
it is not yet clear what impact  if any  the introduction of the ppm will have on ou r revenues for stations which subscribe to arbitron 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
this seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block programming time does not tend to vary significantly  however  because program rates are generally set annually and are recognized on a per program basis 
our cash flow has historically been affected by a transitional period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial to change its format 
this transitional period is when we develop a radio station s listener and customer base 
during this period  a station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our advertising time for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include i employee salaries  commissions and related employee benefits and taxes  ii facility expenses such as rent and utilities  iii marketing and promotional expenses and iv music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and will continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions and existing and future borrowings 
salem web network and townhall 
com  our internet businesses  earn revenues from the sales of streaming services  sales of advertising and  to a lesser extent  sales of software and software support contracts 
salem publishing  our publishing business  earns its revenue by selling advertising in and subscriptions to its publications and by selling books 
xulon press generally earns its revenue from the publishing of books 
the revenue and related operating expenses of these businesses are reported as non broadcast on our consolidated statement of operations 
known trends and uncertainties domestic radio revenues continue to decline 
we believe this is primarily the result of the struggling united states economy and corresponding reductions in discretionary advertising spending by our customers 
beginning in july  our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by declining advertising from our customers  particularly in the financial services and auto industries 
the decline in advertising revenue impacts both our broadcasting segment and non broadcasting segment 
we expect this trend to continue for as long as the united states economy is weak  however  we cannot quantify the financial impact on our future operating results 
in response to these economic challenges  we have initiated several cost reduction strategies including reducing headcount  temporarily suspending the company match on k contributions as of july  temporarily suspending the management bonus program  limiting capital expenditures  reducing the base salary for all employees by as of february  with certain members of executive management reduced by  and requiring all employees to use accrued vacation balances by march  we continue to pursue opportunities to sell assets  particularly stations that are in non strategic formats or are underperforming  the proceeds of which may be used to pay down debt 
this period of economic uncertainty increases our exposure to several risks  including but not limited to substantially increasing our exposure to interest expense due to some of our indebtedness being at a variable rate of interest and the cost of refinancing our debt if we are unable to meet key financial and liquidity ratios  increasing pressure to sell advertising and block programming time at discounted rates  increasing uncollectible accounts as our customers face tight credit markets  ministries are experiencing lower level of donations that could negatively impact their ability to purchase and pay for block programming time  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other corporate requirements  and impairment losses on the value of our fcc licenses and other long lived intangible assets including goodwill 
same station definition in the discussion of our results of operations below  we compare our results between periods on an as reported basis that is  the results of operations of all radio stations and network formats owned or operated at any time during either period and on a same station basis 
with regard to fiscal quarters  we include in our same station comparisons the results of operations of radio stations or radio station clusters and networks that we own or operate in the same format during the quarter  as well as the corresponding quarter of the prior year 
same station results for a full year are based on the sum of the same station results for the four quarters of that year

revenue from block program time as a percentage of our net broadcast revenue increased to for the year ended december   from for the same period of the prior year 
block programming revenue has continued to increase as a percentage of our total broadcast revenue  particularly on our christian teaching and talk stations 
the trend in the radio broadcasting industry is of declining advertising revenues resulting in the use of block programming or infomercials to offset the declines 
additionally  the growth of block programming and infomercial revenue has slowed 
we expect these trends to continue  however  we cannot quantify the financial impact on our future operating results

we expect the trend of increasing bad debt expense to continue given the weakened united states economy depreciation

impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we review the recorded values of our fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  and other non amortizable intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently if conditions indicate that we may have an impairment 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with the fcc licenses and goodwill in the boston  detroit  cleveland  louisville  tampa  miami  orlando  sacramento  omaha  and nashville market clusters 
the impairment charge resulted from weakening radio station valuations as a result of lower revenues and lower growth expectations 
these trends are not specific to any of our individual market clusters  but rather are affecting valuations in the industry as a whole 
we acquired radio stations at various t imes over the last thirty four years  many of which were amortized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
as a result  the carrying value of our fcc licenses and goodwill may exceed the fair value in many of our markets 
for the years ended december   and  the markets for which impairment charges were recorded during accounted for and of total net revenues

we define station operating income soi as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses 
accordingly  changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses  as explained above  have a direct impact on changes in soi 
soi is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  as a result it should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of gaap 
management believes that soi is a useful non gaap financial measure to investors  when considered in conjunction with operating income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media  entertainment and communications industries 
this measure is used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups 
additionally  our management uses soi as one of the key measures of operating efficiency  profitability and our internal review associated with our impairment analysis of indefinite lived intan gible assets 
soi does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities 
our statement of cash flows presents our cash flow activity and our income statement presents our historical performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
soi as defined by and used by our company is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other non intangible assets  uncertain tax positions  valuation allowance deferred taxes  long term debt and debt covenant compliance  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstanc es  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies which affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets a majority of our radio station acquisitions are acquisitions of selected assets and not acquisitions of businesses 
such asset acquisitions have consisted primarily of the fcc licenses to broadcast in a particular market 
we often do not acquire the existing format  or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial 
as a result  a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the fcc license 
it is our policy generally to retain third party appraisers to value radio stations  networks or non broadcast properties 
the allocations assigned to acquired fcc licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful consideration and judgment 
we believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired 
as part of the valuation and appraisal process  the third party appraisers prepare reports which assign values to the various asset categories in our financial statements 
our management reviews these reports and determines the reasonableness of the assigned values used to record the acquisition of the radio station  network or non broadcast properties at the close of the transaction 
we undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and or fcc licenses 
our policy is to capitalize costs incurred up to the point where the project is complete  at which time we transfer the costs to the appropriate fixed asset and or intangible asset categories 
when the completion of a project is contingent upon fcc or other regulatory approval  we assess the probable future benefit of the asset at the time that it is recorded and monitor it through the fcc or other regulatory approval process 
in the event the required approval is not considered probable or the project is abandoned  we write off the capitalized costs of the project 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the service has been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
revenue from radio programs and commercial advertising is recognized when the program or commercial is broadcast 
revenue is reported net of agency commissions  which are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing 
our customers principally include not for profit charitable organizations and commercial advertisers 
revenue from the sale of products and services from our non broadcast businesses is recognized when the products are shipped and the services are rendered 
revenues from the sale of advertising in our publications are recognized upon publication 
revenues from the sale of subscriptions to our publications are recognized over the life of the subscription 
revenues from book sales are recorded by when shipment occurs 
advertising by the radio stations exchanged for goods and services is recorded as the advertising is broadcast and is valued at the estimated value of goods or services received or to be received 
the value of the goods and services received in such barter transactions is charged to expense when used 
we record broadcast advertising provided in exchange for goods and services as broadcast revenue and the goods or services received in exchange for such advertising as broadcast operating expenses 
based on our past experience  the use of these criteria has been a reliable method to recognize revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on the age of the receivable and other subjective and historical analysis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets approximately of our total assets consist of non amortizable intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill and mastheads  the value of which depends significantly upon the operating results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years for a nominal cost that is expensed as incurred 
we continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our fcc licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective periods  and we expect that all fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
accordingly  we consider our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we do not amortize goodwill or other inde finite lived intangible assets  but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level  which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market  sharing the same building and equipment and being managed by a single general manager 
goodwill and mastheads  primarily attributable to our non broadcast operating segment  are tested at the business unit level  which we define by publication or website 
goodwill associated with our broadcast segment is tested at the reporting unit level  defined as a market cluster 
we complete our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
however  based on deteriorating macro economic factors  including declining radio industry revenues during and a weakening in prevailing radio station transaction multiples  we concluded that  in connection with preparing our financial statements for the period ended september   an interim valuation pursuant to sfas no 
was appropriate 
we reviewed the financial performance of certain accounting units against established internal benchmarks 
the accounting units selected were based on declines in projected market revenues and market analysis from industry experts that indicated a more than remote likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the carrying value 
for the selected accounting units that did not meet the internal benchmarks  bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal and valuation firm was engaged to perform an appraisal of the indefinite lived asset s 
as a result of our interim review and third party valuation  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million associated with the value of broadcast licenses in the cleveland market cluster 
during the fourth quarter of we completed our annual impairment tests for all markets 
we reviewed the financial performance of all accounting units against established internal benchmarks 
for accounting units that did not meet the internal benchmarks  bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal and valuation firm  was engaged to perform an appraisal of the indefinite lived asset s 
as a result of our annual review and valuation  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the value of broadcast licenses in the boston  detroit  cleveland  louisville  tampa  miami  orlando  sacramento  omaha  and nashville market clusters 
the impairments are driven in part by declining revenue at the industry and market levels  declining radio stations transaction multiples  and a higher cost of capital 
the impairments are indicative of a trend in the broadcast industry and are not unique to our company 
we also reviewed goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
for reporting units in which the fair value exceeded the carrying value  no loss was recognized 
for reporting units in which the fair value did not exceed the carrying value  a potential impairment was identified 
the implied value of goodwill for these reporting units was calculated using third party independent appraisals as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
based on this review  an impairment loss on goodwill of million was recognized during the fourth quarter of equal to the excess of the implied value of goodwill over the carrying value 
the value of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations 
if actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future 
uncertain tax positions we adopted fasb issued interpretation no

on the date of adoption we had million in liabilities related to uncertain tax positions  including million recognized under sfas no

management regularly reviews our financial forecasts in an effort to determine our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
accordingly  the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on management s estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards 
derivative instruments we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
salem actively monitors these fluctuations and uses derivative instruments from time to time to manage the related risk 
in accordance with its risk management strategy  salem uses derivative instruments only for the purpose of managing risk associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction  or probable forecasted transaction that is identified by management 
our use of derivative instruments may result in short term gains or losses that may increase the volatility of salem s earnings

 fair value measurements 
in general  fair value measurements and disclosures are made in accordance with the provisions of this statement and  while not requiring material new fair value measurements  sfas no 
established a single definition of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this statement apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the financial accounting standards board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute

 referred to as fas no 
in this report 
fas no 
delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we adopted sfas no 
for financial assets and financial liabilities effective january  the adoption had a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we adopted sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities effective january  this includes applying the provisions of sfas no 
to i nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in business combinations  ii reporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill impairment testing  iii other nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction with impairment assessments  and iv asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value 
we are currently assessing the potential effect of the adoption of the remaining provisions of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial position  results of operations a nd cash flows on october   the fasb issued fasb staff position fas no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  referred to as fas no 
in this report 
fas provides clarification regarding the application of sfas in inactive markets 
the provisions of fas no 
were effective upon issuance 
this staff position did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
pricing observability is affected by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market  and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have less or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
sfas no 
established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value 
this framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process  and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three broad levels of inputs defined by the sfas no 
hierarchy are as follows level inputs quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date  level inputs inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
if the asset or liability has a specified contractual term  a level input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  and level inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
these unobservable inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances which might include the reporting entity s own data 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we have modified the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of derivative positions 
specifically  we now include the impact of our own credit risk on derivative liabilities measured at fair value under sfas no 
counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to derivatives  such as over the counter derivatives  where the base valuation uses market parameters based on libor interest rate curves 
not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant libor curve  so it is necessary to consider the market value of the credit risk of counterparty in order to estimate the fair value of such an item 
bilateral or own credit risk adjustments are applied to our own credit risk when valuing derivatives measured at fair value 
counterparty and own credit adjustments consider the estimated future cash flows between us and our counterparties under the terms of the instrument and effect the credit risk on the valuation of those cash flows  rather than a point in time assessment of current recognized net asset or liability 
the fair value of our liabilities was impacted by the widening of our credit spread 
the estimated change in the fair value of these liabilities due to such changes as our own credit risk was a gain of million for the year ended december  changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating our current observable credit spreads into the relevant valuation techniques used to value each liability 
our financial liabilities reported at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  as of december   were as follows as of december  dollars in thousands level level level total interest rate swap agreements long term debt and debt covenant compliance our classification of borrowings under our credit facilities as long term debt on our balance sheet is based on our assessment that  under the borrowing restrictions and covenants in our credit facilities and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year  no principal payments  other than the scheduled principal reductions in our term loan facility  will be required pursuant to the credit agreement 
these projections are estimates dependent upon a number of factors including developments in the markets in which we are operating in and economic and political factors  among other factors 
accordingly  these projections are inherently uncertain and our actual results could differ from these estimates 
should our actual results differ materially from these estimates  payments may become due under our credit facilities or it may become necessary to seek an amendment to our credit facil ities 
based on our management s current assessment  we do not anticipate principal payments becoming due under our credit facilities other than the scheduled principal reductions in our term loan facility 
effective march   we amended our credit facilities for the pro forma debt service requirement and certain other terms 
stock based compensation we have one stock option plan  the amended and restated stock incentive plan  the plan under which stock options and restricted stock units are granted to employees  directors  officers and advisors of the company 
a maximum of  shares are authorized under the plan  of which  are outstanding and  are exercisable as of december  effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share based awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not currently significant to the calculation of fair value based on current expectations of dividends and the number of options granted

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings  including borrowings under credit facilities and  to a lesser extent  from operating cash flow and selected asset dispositions 
we expect to fund future acquisitions from cash on hand  proceeds from our debt and equity offerings  borrowings under the credit facilities  operating cash flow and possibly through the sale of income producing assets 
we have historically funded  and will continue to fund  expenditures for operations  administrative expenses  capital expenditures and debt service required by our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes from operating cash flow  borrowings under our credit facilities and swingline and  if necessary  proceeds from the sale of selected assets or radio stations 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under the credit facilities will be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations  fund pending acquisitions and fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
our term loan b credit facility matures on march  and our senior subordinated notes mature on december  given the deterioration of the credit markets in the latter half of  we are likely to incur significant costs and higher interest rates under any new financing arrangements 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents were million on december  and million on december  working capital was million as of december  compared to million on december  the decrease in working capital of million reflects the sale of million of assets held for sale associated with our discontinued operations in milwaukee  offset by a million decline in the current portion of long term debt due to the repayment of our revolving line of credit and swingline 
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from continuing operations are primarily derived from our earnings from ongoing operations before non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  bad debt  and stock based compensation and changes in our working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the increase of million reflects the impact of the million decrease in net income from continuing operations offset by non cash impairment charges of million  the favorable impact on deferred income taxes of million  and an increase in bad debt allowance of million combined with the changes in operating assets and liabilities including a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense 
cash flows from investing activities our investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions or dispositions of radio station assets and strategic acquisitions of non broadcast businesses 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the increase of million was due to the approximately million purchase of real estate from principal stockholders and the million purchase of selected assets of wmcu am  miami  florida  offset by a million decline in capital expenditures and million increase in proceeds from asset sales 
cash flows from financing activities our financing activities primarily relate to proceeds and repayments under our credit facilities  payments of capital lease obligations  payments of dividends and repurchases of our class a common stock 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the increase of million reflects the million net increase in debt repayments in the current year compared to last year offset by a reduction of million in special cash dividend payments  and the million paid in the prior year for repurchases of class a common stock
