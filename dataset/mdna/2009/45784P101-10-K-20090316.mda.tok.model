item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets an insulin infusion system for people with insulin dependent diabetes 
our proprietary omnipod insulin management system consists of our omnipod disposable insulin infusion device and our handheld  wireless personal diabetes manager 
from inception through the year ended december   we devoted substantially all of our efforts to designing and developing the omnipod system  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
as a result  we were considered a development stage company pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises  through december  the year was the first year during which we were an operating company and were no longer in the development stage 
in october  we shipped our first commercial omnipod system 
since october  in order to align the demand for the omnipod system with our capacity to manufacture the omnipod  we have progressively expanded our marketing efforts from an initial focus in the eastern united states to having availability of the omnipod system in the entire united states 
we focus our sales towards key diabetes practitioners  academic centers and clinics specializing in the treatment of diabetic patients 
our total revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  construction was completed on a partially automated manufacturing line at a facility in china operated by a subsidiary of flextronics international ltd 
we purchase complete omnipods pursuant to our agreement with flextronics entered into on january  and revised on october  under the agreement  flextronics has agreed to supply us  as a non exclusive supplier  with omnipods at agreed upon prices per unit pursuant to a rolling month forecast that we provide to flextronics 
the initial term of the agreement is three years from january   with automatic one year renewals 
the agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon prior written notice given no less than a specified number of days prior to the date of termination 
the specified number of days is intended to provide the parties with sufficient time to make alternative arrangements in the event of termination 
by purchasing omnipods manufactured by flextronics in china  we were able to substantially increase production volumes for the omnipod and reduce our per unit production cost 
we also produce certain sub assemblies for the omnipod as well as maintain packaging operations at our facility in bedford  massachusetts 
as a medical device company  reimbursement from third party payors is an important element of our success 
if patients are not adequately reimbursed for the costs of using the omnipod system  it will be much more difficult for us to penetrate the market 
we continue to negotiate contracts establishing reimbursement 
table of contents for the omnipod system with national and regional third party payors  and we believe that substantially all of the units sold have been reimbursed by third party payors  subject to applicable deductible and co payment amounts 
as we expand our sales and marketing focus  increase our manufacturing capacity and expand to international markets  we will need to maintain and expand available reimbursement for the omnipod system 
since our inception in  we have incurred losses every quarter 
in the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations through the private placement of equity securities  public offerings of our common stock as well as a private placement of our convertible debt 
as of december   we had million of convertible debt outstanding 
since inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock  common stock and convertible debt 
in may  in our initial public offering  we issued and sold  shares of common stock to the public at a price of per share 
in june  we issued and sold an additional  shares of common stock to the public at a price of per share pursuant to the underwriters partial exercise of their over allotment option 
in connection with the initial public offering  including the partial exercise of the over allotment option  we received total gross proceeds of million  or approximately million of net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
in november  in a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share by certain of our stockholders  we issued and sold an additional  shares of common stock at the public offering price pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
in connection with the public offering  we received total gross proceeds of million  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
in june  we sold million principal amount of convertible senior notes due june  the notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum on the principal amount from june   payable semi annually in arrears in cash on december and june of each year  beginning december  the notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
in connection with the private placement of our convertible debt  we received total gross proceeds of million  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and offering expenses 
on march   we entered into a facility agreement with certain institutional accredited investors  pursuant to which the investors agreed to loan up to million  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the facility agreement 
following the initial disbursement of million within fifteen business days of march   we may  but are not required to  draw down on the facility in million increments at any time until november provided that we meet certain financial milestones 
while we can not provide assurance that we will meet any or all of these financial milestones  based upon current estimates and assumptions  we expect to be able  at our discretion  to draw down at least an additional million under this facility 
upon execution of this facility agreement  we issued to the lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with the initial million draw down from the facility 
as noted above  pursuant to the facility agreement  we have the right to request from the lenders one or more cash disbursements in the minimum amount of million per disbursement  and each such disbursement will be accompanied by the issuance to the lenders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock  at an exercise price equal to of the average volume weighted average price of our common stock on the fifteen consecutive trading days beginning with the date following receipt by the lenders of the disbursement request 
if we  in our discretion  draw down the entire million credit facility  we will have issued warrants to purchase a total of million shares of our common stock 
see note for a summary of this financing 

table of contents our long term financial objective is to achieve and sustain profitable growth 
our efforts for will be focused primarily on continuing to reduce our per unit production costs  expanding sales to domestic and international markets and reducing our spending on manufacturing overhead and operating expenses 
the continued expansion of our manufacturing capacity will help us to achieve lower material costs due to volume purchase discounts and improved absorption of manufacturing overhead costs  reducing our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue 
achieving these objectives is expected to require additional investments in certain personnel and initiatives to allow for us to increase our market penetration in the united states market and enter certain international markets 
we believe that we will continue to incur net losses in the near term in order to achieve these objectives  particularly in light of the recession in the united states and the slowdown of economic growth in the rest of the world which is creating a challenging near term business environment 
however  we believe that the accomplishment of our near term objectives will have a positive impact on our financial condition in the future 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  including the net proceeds from our public and private offerings and draw downs on our up to million credit facility  together with the cash to be generated from expected product sales  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements through at least the end of convertible notes and repayment and termination of term loan in june  we sold million principal amount of convertible senior notes due june  the notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum on the principal amount from june   payable semi annually in arrears in cash on december and june of each year  beginning december  the notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  representing a conversion premium of to the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on june   subject to adjustment under certain circumstances  at any time beginning on march  or under certain other circumstances and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the final maturity date of the notes 
the notes will be convertible for cash up to their principal amount and shares of our common stock for the remainder of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount 
we do not have the right to redeem any of the notes prior to maturity 
if a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture for the notes  occurs at any time prior to maturity  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes in whole or in part for cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including any additional interest  to  but excluding  the date of repurchase 
if a holder elects to convert its notes upon the occurrence of a make whole fundamental change  as defined in the indenture for the notes  the holder may be entitled to receive an additional number of shares of common stock on the conversion date 
these additional shares are intended to compensate the holders for the loss of the time value of the conversion option  and are set forth in the indenture for the notes 
in no event will the shares issuable upon conversion of a note exceed per  principal amount subject to adjustment as described in the indenture for the notes 
we incurred interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december   related to the notes 
we incurred deferred financing costs related to this offering of approximately million  which are recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized as a component of interest expense over the five year term of the notes 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this offering 
approximately million of the net proceeds from this offering was used to repay and terminate our existing term loan  including outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest of million  a prepayment fee related to the term loan of approximately million and a termination fee of million 
we are using the remainder for general corporate purposes 
we incurred interest expense of approximately million  million and 
table of contents million on the term loan for the years ended december   and respectively 
the term loan was subject to a loan origination fee of million  which was recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and was being amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the loan 
the remaining balance of deferred financing costs of approximately million was written off at the repayment and termination date 
in connection with this term loan  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase up to  shares of series e preferred stock at a purchase price of per share 
the warrants automatically converted into warrants to purchase common stock on a for basis at a purchase price of per share at the closing of our initial public offering in may we recorded the million fair value of the warrants as a discount to the term loan 
upon repayment and termination of the term loan  we recognized approximately million as interest expense for the unamortized balance of the warrants fair value 
the difference between the amount paid  including the prepayment fee  and the carrying value of the term loan  including the remaining deferred financing costs and unamortized warrants to purchase common stock  was recognized as a million loss from early extinguishment of the term loan 
in connection with the adoption of fsp apb in the first quarter of  we will reclassify a portion of the debt related to the notes to equity 
we anticipate that the reclassification of approximately to million of long term debt to equity will result in approximately to million in additional non cash interest expense during financial operations overview revenues 
revenues are recognized in accordance with securities and exchange staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  or sfas we derive most of our revenues from the sale of the omnipod system directly to patients and third party distributors who resell the product to diabetes patients 
the omnipod system is comprised of two devices the omnipod  a disposable insulin infusion device that the patient wears for up to three days and then replaces  and the personal diabetes manager  or pdm  a handheld device much like a personal digital assistant that wirelessly programs the omnipod with insulin delivery instructions  assists the patient with diabetes management and incorporates a blood glucose meter 
revenues are derived from the sale to new customers or third party distributors of omnipods and starter kits  which include the pdm  two omnipods  the omnipod system user guide and our interactive training cd  and from the subsequent sales of omnipods to existing customers 
customers generally order a three month supply of omnipods 
during the years ended december   and  materially all of our revenues were derived from sales within the united states 
in march  we received a cash payment from abbott diabetes care  inc abbott for an agreement fee in connection with execution of the first amendment to the development and license agreement with abbott 
we are recognizing the payment as revenue over the year term of the agreement 
under the amended abbott agreement  beginning july   abbott agreed to pay us an amount for services performed by us in connection with each sale of a pdm that includes an abbott discrete blood glucose monitor to a new customer 
we recognize the revenue related to this portion of the abbott agreement at the time the revenue is recognized on the sale of the pdm to the patient 
in the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue  related to the amended abbott agreement 
there was no impact to cost of revenue related to this agreement 
prior to january   we deferred recognition of revenue from the omnipods and starter kit shipped as part of a customer s initial shipment for days during which time the items could be returned and completely refunded 
effective for shipments made after december   we have deferred revenue based on estimated returns  assessment of collectibility and the transfer of risk and title 
if we had continued to defer all initial shipments until the day right of return had expired  deferred revenue as of december  would have been larger by approximately million 
as of december  and  the balance of deferred revenue was million and million  respectively  which includes the current portion of deferred revenue related to the agreement fee received under the first amendment to our development agreement with abbott 

table of contents for the year ending december   we expect our revenues to increase 
we expect our omnipod sales and production to grow 
our omnipod manufacturing capacity at the end of was in excess of  omnipods per month 
additionally  increased revenues will be dependent upon the success of our sales efforts and subject to many risk and uncertainties 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of raw material  labor  warranty and overhead costs related to the omnipod system 
cost of revenues also includes depreciation  freight and packaging costs 
the increase in our omnipod manufacturing production  as well as increased use of contract manufacturers  is expected to reduce the per unit cost of manufacturing the omnipods by allowing us to spread our fixed and semi fixed overhead costs over a greater number of units 
however  if sales volumes do not increase  then the average cost of revenues per omnipod may not decrease and we may incur gross losses 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our product development  regulatory and clinical functions  and the costs of market studies and product development projects 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
for the fiscal year  we expect overall research and development spending to be in line with current levels in order to support our current research and development efforts  which are focused primarily on increased functionality  design for ease of use and reduction of production cost  as well as developing a new omnipod system that incorporates continuous glucose monitoring technology 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our sales  marketing  reimbursement support  customer support and training functions  sales commissions paid to our sales representatives and costs associated with participation in medical conferences  physician symposia and promotional activities  including distribution of units used in our demonstration kit programs 
in the year ending december   we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales compared to as we continue to align our sales and marketing efforts with our business needs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  finance  information technology and human resource functions  as well as legal fees  accounting fees  insurance costs  bad debt expenses  shipping  handling and facilities related costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to be at a similar level in compared to restructuring expenses and impairments of assets 
in connection with our efforts to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing of asset costs  we periodically perform an evaluation of our manufacturing processes and review the carrying value of our property and equipment to assess the recoverability of these assets and determine whether impairment may have occurred 
as part of this assessment  we review the planned use of the assets as well as the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if impairment is indicated through this review  the carrying amount of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value 
this review of manufacturing processes and equipment can result in restructuring activity or an impairment of assets based on current net book value and potential future use of the assets 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our restructuring expenses may also include workforce reduction and related costs for one time termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement 
we record these one time termination benefits upon incurring the liability provided that the employees are notified  the plan is approved by the appropriate level of management  the employees to be terminated and the expected completion date are identified and the benefits the identified employees will be paid are established 
significant changes to the plan are not expected when we record the costs 
in recording the workforce reduction and related costs  we estimate related costs such as taxes and outplacement services which may be provided under the plan 
if changes in these estimated services occur  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with these workforce reduction and related costs 
we recorded workforce related charges of million in the year ended december  no workforce related charges were recorded in the year ended december

prior to january   we accounted for our stock based awards under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no

we adopted sfas r on a prospective basis 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues our total revenues were million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues is due to the increase in the number of diabetes patients using the omnipod system as well as new relationships with third party distributors who resell our product to diabetes patients 
cost of revenues cost of revenues was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to increased sales volume partially offset by lower per unit costs 
cost of revenues includes adjustment of inventory to the lower of cost or market and indirect costs 
since the omnipods were sold at a price below direct manufacturing costs in  the inventory adjustment made as of december  increased cost of revenues by million 
there was no adjustment made as of december  this is a result of a reduced cost of raw materials and increased volumes which improved the absorption of manufacturing overhead costs 
during the third quarter  we incurred production costs for the omnipod which were lower than its selling price  primarily due to increased production volumes of the omnipod which improved positive gross margin on sales of our omnipod system 

table of contents research and development research and development expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the increase in expense was primarily attributable to an increase of million in employee related expenses  million in consulting services  million in tools and supplies  offset by a million decrease in prototype and other expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the increase in expense was primarily due to an increase of million in employee related expenses primarily with respect to the hiring of additional employees  million related to allowances for doubtful accounts  million in consulting related expenses  million in increased depreciation expense  million for travel expenses and million in increased freight expense 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses for the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase of million in employee related expenses resulting from the hiring of additional employees in our sales and marketing departments  million in patient demonstration kit units and other supplies  million in travel expenses  million in marketing consultants which include our external trainers and million in printing and tradeshow expenses used to support our selling efforts 
restructuring and impairment of assets restructuring expenses and impairment of assets was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million for the impairment of certain manufacturing equipment no longer in use as well as workforce reduction and related costs 
as part of the our strategic goal to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing  we transitioned the manufacturing of completed omnipods to flextronics international ltd  located in china 
we determined that we would no longer use certain manufacturing equipment located in our bedford facility 
in addition  this transition resulted in a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  mainly in the manufacturing and quality departments 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to impairments of assets as well as million in workforce and related charges 
employees terminated were mainly in the manufacturing and quality departments 
in addition  certain members of senior management were terminated 
this reduction was primarily in response to our successful transition of portions of the manufacturing process to flextronics as well as on going alignment of our infrastructure 
during the third quarter of  we successfully transitioned our production of completed omnipods to the manufacturing line operated by flextronics 
pursuant to our agreement with flextronics  flextronics will supply  as a non exclusive supplier  omnipods at agreed upon prices per unit pursuant to a rolling month forecast provided by us 
the initial term of the agreement is three years from january   with automatic one year renewals 
the agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon prior written notice given no less than a specified number of days prior to the date of termination 
we continue to manufacture certain sub assemblies and maintain packaging operations in our bedford  massachusetts facility 
we ceased to use certain assets in our bedford facility in connection with the transition of manufacturing to flextronics 
we continued to evaluate flextronics ability to manufacture completed omnipods against the rolling forecast as well as anticipated capacity and demand throughout the fourth quarter of during the 
table of contents fourth quarter we concluded that the capacity of the manufacturing line operated by flextronics is considered adequate to meet anticipated demand and quality standards in the future 
as we determined that we will no longer use the bedford equipment on december   we recorded an impairment charge for the remaining net book value of the assets of million on that date 
the equipment has no expected salvage value as it is highly customized equipment that can only be used for the manufacture of omnipods 
at december   our accrued restructuring was million for final payments of severance and will be utilized during the following is a summary of restructuring activity for the year ended december  year ended december  workforce and related in thousands balance at the beginning of year restructuring expense utilization balance at the end of the year during the year ended december   we completed the evaluation of an upgrade of our manufacturing processes 
the upgrade of our product design and associated manufacturing processes were aimed at achieving lower per unit costs 
as a result  we performed a review of certain production equipment 
the review resulted in a non cash charge of million for the write down of certain impaired assets 
the impaired assets  which had no future use  consisted of manufacturing equipment 
the impairment charges were recorded following determination of the fair value of cash flows resulting from use of the affected assets  and the carrying value of the assets has been reduced to reflect their fair value 
other income expense interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million compared to the year ended december   caused primarily by lower cash balances and interest rates 
interest income was earned from cash deposits and short term interest bearing instruments 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of million compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was attributable to higher debt levels under our million debt note and interest on the notes 
upon the closing of our initial public offering in may  all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the aggregate fair value of these warrants as of may   determined to be million  was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid in capital  a component of stockholders equity  and we have ceased to record any related periodic fair value adjustments 
as a result of the determination of fair value  we recorded other expenses of approximately million in the year ended december   as the aggregate fair value of warrants decreased from the value recorded at march  the decrease in fair value was primarily caused by a lower expected life for the warrants  considering the existence of a market for our company s common stock 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues our total revenues were million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues is due to the increase in the number of customers using the omnipod system

all of these preferred shares converted into shares of common stock on a for basis upon the closing of our initial public offering 
in june  we entered into a term loan and security agreement with lighthouse capital partners v  lp pursuant to which we borrowed million 
this term loan was secured by all of our assets other than our intellectual property

interest 
table of contents was payable on a monthly basis during the term of the loan and beginning on june   we were required to repay the principal in equal monthly installments until the loan matured in december upon the prepayment or final maturity of the term loan  we were required to pay the lender an additional amount equal to million of the original loan amount 
in connection with the term loan  we issued a warrant to the lender to purchase up to  shares of series d preferred stock at a purchase price of per share 
the warrant automatically converted into a warrant to purchase common stock on a for basis at a purchase price of per share upon the closing of our initial public offering 
the cost of the warrant was being amortized to interest expense over the month life of this term loan 
the fair value of the warrant was calculated using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions seven year expected life risk free  interest rate of and no dividend yield 
in december  we entered into a credit and security agreement with a group of lenders led by merrill lynch capital pursuant to which we borrowed million in a term loan 
we used million of the proceeds from this term loan to repay all remaining amounts owed under the loan with lighthouse capital partners v  lp that we had entered into in june this term loan was secured by all of our assets other than our intellectual property 
our borrowings under the term loan bore interest at a floating rate equal to the libor rate plus per annum 
interest was payable on a monthly basis during the term of the loan and we began repayment of the principal equal monthly installments of million in october in addition  we were subject to loan origination fees amounting to million for the costs incurred by the lenders in making the funds available 
we capitalized these costs as deferred financing costs 
the deferred financing cost was being amortized to interest expense over the entire month life of this term loan 
this term loan was subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of any fact  event or circumstance that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect 
consequently  due to our low cash resources  relative to our operating losses  prior to our initial public offering  all of such debt was classified as a current liability at december  in accordance with the provisions set forth by fasb technical bulletin no 
subjective acceleration clauses in long term debt agreements 
in connection with the term loan  we issued seven year warrants expiring in december to the lenders to purchase up to  shares of series e preferred stock at a purchase price of per share 
the warrants automatically converted into warrants to purchase common stock on a for basis at a purchase price of per share upon the closing of our initial public offering 
in june  we sold million principal amount of convertible senior notes due june  the notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum on the principal amount from june   payable semi annually in arrears in cash on december and june of each year  beginning december  the notes are convertible into our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  representing a conversion premium of to the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on june   per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances  at any time beginning on march  or under certain other circumstances and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the final maturity date of the notes 
the notes will be convertible for cash up to their principal amount and shares of our common stock for the remainder of the conversion value in excess of the principal amount 
we do not have the right to redeem any of the notes prior to maturity

we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the notes 
on june   we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the entire outstanding principal balance  plus accrued and unpaid interest  under our existing term loan in the aggregate of approximately million in its entirety 
additionally  we paid a prepayment fee related to the term loan of approximately million  a termination 
table of contents fee related to the term loan of million  and incurred certain other expenses related to the repayment and termination of the term loan 
we lease our facilities  which are accounted for as operating leases 
the leases of our facilities in bedford and billerica  massachusetts  generally provide for a base rent plus real estate taxes and certain operating expenses related to the lease 
all operating leases contain renewal options and escalating payments over the life of the lease 
as of december   we had an outstanding letter of credit which totaled million to cover our security deposits for lease obligations 
this letter of credit will expire october  during the year ending december   we will be expending funds in connection with  among other things  our efforts to increase our production capacity and expand our sales and marketing activities to international markets 
shareholder rights plan in november  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan  as set forth in the shareholder rights agreement between us and the rights agent  the purpose of which is  among other things  to enhance the board s ability to protect shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of us is made in the future 
the shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  us or a large block of our common stock 
in connection with the adoption of the shareholder rights plan  our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on november  in addition  one right will automatically attach to each share of common stock issued between november  and the distribution date 
the rights currently are not exercisable and are attached to and trade with the outstanding shares of common stock 
under the shareholder rights plan  the rights become exercisable if a person or group becomes an acquiring person by acquiring or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or if a person or group commences a tender offer that would result in that person owning or more of the common stock 
if a person or group becomes an acquiring person  each holder of a right other than the acquiring person would be entitled to purchase  at the then current exercise price  such number of shares of our preferred stock which are equivalent to shares of common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after any such event  each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase  at the then current exercise price  shares of the acquiring company s common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations long term debt obligations purchase obligations for production components total contractual obligations 
table of contents the interest rate on the long term debt is per annum 
we have included future payments of interest on the long term debt in our obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
revenue recognition we generate nearly all of our revenue from sales of our omnipod insulin management system to diabetes patients or third party distributors who resell the product to diabetes patients 
the initial sale to a new customer typically includes omnipods and a starter kit  which include the pdm  two omnipods  the omnipod system user guide and the omnipod system interactive training cd 
we offer a day right of return for our starter kits sales 
subsequent sales to existing customers typically consist of additional omnipods 
revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  which requires that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery of goods occurs through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with respect to these criteria the evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a physician order form  a patient information form  and if applicable  third party insurance approval for sales directly to patients or a purchase order for sales to a third party distributor 
transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership are passed to the patient or third party distributor upon their receipt of the products 
the selling prices for all sales are fixed and agreed with the patient or third party distributor  and if applicable  the patient s third party insurance provider s prior to shipment and are based on established list prices or  in the case of certain third party insurers  contractually agreed upon prices 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are established as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we have considered the requirements of emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when accounting for the omnipods and starter kits 
eitf requires that we assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting 
we recognize revenue for the initial shipment to a patient or other third party once all elements have been delivered 
we offer a day right of return for our starter kits sales and have applied statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  or sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we defer the revenue to reflect estimated sales returns in the same period that the related product sales are recorded 
returns are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales 
historical rates of return are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace when appropriate 
historically  sales returns have amounted to approximately of gross product sales 
prior to january   we deferred the revenue and related costs of revenue for all initial shipments until the day right of return had lapsed 
with the accumulation of approximately years of data for sales and return rates  we concluded that we had sufficient historical data on which to base our estimated returns 
table of contents from january  if we had continued to defer all initial shipments until the day right of return had expired  deferred revenue as of december  would have been larger by million 
when doubt exists about reasonable assuredness of collectibility from specific customers  we defer revenue from sales of products to those customers until payment is received 
in march  we received a cash payment from abbott diabetes care  inc abbott for an agreement fee in connection with execution of the first amendment to the development and license agreement between us and abbott 
we recognize the agreement fee received from abbott over the year term of the agreement  and the non current portion of the agreement fee is included in other long term liabilities 
under the amended abbott agreement  beginning july   abbott agreed to pay us an amount for services performed by us in connection with each sale of a pdm that includes an abbott discrete blood glucose monitor to a new customer 
we recognize the revenue related to this portion of the abbott agreement at the time the revenue is recognized on the sale of the pdm to the patient 
in the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue related to the amended abbott agreement 
there was no impact to cost of revenue related to this agreement 
we recognize subsequent sales of omnipods upon shipment in accordance with the provisions set forth by sab restructuring expense and impairment of assets as part of our efforts to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing of asset costs  we periodically perform an evaluation of our manufacturing processes and review the carrying value of our property and equipment to assess the recoverability of these assets whenever events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
as part of this assessment  we review the planned use of the assets as well as the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if impairment is indicated through this review  the carrying amount of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value 
this review of manufacturing processes and equipment can result in restructuring activity or an impairment of assets based on current net book value and potential future use of the assets 
our restructuring expenses may also include workforce reduction and related costs for one time termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement 
we record these one time termination benefits upon incurring the liability provided that the employees are notified  the plan is approved by the appropriate level of management  the employees to be terminated and the expected completion date are identified and the benefits the identified employees will be paid are established 
significant changes to the plan are not expected when we record the costs 
in recording the workforce reduction and related costs  we estimate related costs such as taxes and outplacement services which may be provided under the plan 
if changes in these estimated services occur  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with these workforce reduction and related costs 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the life of the lease  whichever is shorter 
we review long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we also review assets under construction to ensure certainty of their future installation and integration into the manufacturing process 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we 
table of contents consider various valuation factors  principally planned use of the assets and discounted cash flows  to assess the fair values of long lived assets 
income taxes in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin on january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
upon adoption and as of december  and  we have no unrecognized tax benefits recorded 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of statement no 
 or sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and amends fasb statement no 
statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
sfas r requires nonpublic companies that used the minimum value method in sfas r for either recognition or pro forma disclosures to apply sfas r using the prospective transition method 
as such  we will continue to apply apb in future periods to equity awards outstanding at the date of sfas r adoption that were measured using the minimum value method 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas r  we will not present pro forma disclosures for periods prior to the adoption of sfas r  as the estimated fair value of our stock options granted through december  was determined using the minimum value method 
effective january  with the adoption of sfas r  we elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted 
in accordance with sfas r  we recognize the compensation expense of share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
because our initial public offering was completed in may  we do not have sufficient history of market prices of our common stock  and as such we estimate volatility in accordance with securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab  using historical volatilities of comparable public entities 
the expected life of the awards is estimated based on the sec shortcut approach as defined in sab  which is the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on company history and expectation of paying no dividends 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value the awards on a quarterly basis and if factors change and different assumptions are utilized  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what has been recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 

table of contents prior to april   the exercise prices for options granted were set by our board of directors based upon guidance set forth by the american institute of certified public accountants in the aicpa technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
to that end  the board considered a number of factors in determining the option price  including the following factors prices for our preferred stock  which we had sold to outside investors in arms length transactions  and the rights  preferences and privileges of our preferred stock and common stock in the series a through series e financing  obtaining fda k clearance  launching the omnipod system and achievement of budgeted revenue and results 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for our initial public offering  we retrospectively estimated the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including the following operating and financial performance  progress and milestones attained in the business  past sales of convertible preferred stock  the results of the retrospective independent valuations  and the expected valuation obtained in an initial public offering 
we believe this to have been a reasonable methodology based on the factors above and based on several arm s length transactions involving our stock supportive of the results produced by this valuation methodology 
warrants in connection with the term loans with lighthouse capital partners in and a group of lenders led by merrill lynch capital in  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock 
until the completion of our initial public offering  these warrants were recorded as warrants to purchase shares subject to redemption in current liabilities in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas  and fasb staff position no 
issuer s accounting under fasb statement no 
for freestanding warrants and other similar instruments on shares that are redeemable  or fsp significant terms and fair values of warrants to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock are as follows in thousands except share and per share data exercise common shares as of fair value as of expiration price december  december  december  december  stock date per share series e preferred december    upon the closing of our initial public offering in may  all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase shares of our common stock on a for basis at a purchase price of per share and  as a result  are no longer be subject to fsp for periods ended or ending on or after that date 
the aggregate fair value of these warrants as of may   determined to be million  was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid in capital  a component of stockholders equity  and we have ceased to record any related periodic fair value adjustments 
in the year ended december   lighthouse capital partners v  lp exercised their right to convert  warrants into common stock  resulting in the issuance and purchase of  shares of our common stock at per share 
in addition  two members of the group of lenders led by merrill lynch capital exercised their right to convert a total of  warrants into common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
we recorded million fair value of the warrants for series e preferred stock as a discount to the term loan with merrill lynch capital 
the value of the warrants was being amortized to interest expense over the month life of this term loan 
upon repayment and termination of the term loan in june  we recognized approximately million as interest expense for the unamortized balance of the warrants fair value 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due from third party payors  patients and third party distributors 
we account for doubtful accounts using the allowance method 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are 
table of contents recorded in the period in which the revenue is recorded 
we base our allowance on historical experience  assessment of specific risk  discussions with individual customers or various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued staff position accounting principles board  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fsp apb clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion should be separated between the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
we anticipate that the reclassification of approximately to million of long term debt to equity under the provisions of fsp apb will result in approximately to million in additional interest expense during we do not anticipate the adoption of fsp apb to impact to our cash flows during the year ending december  in may  the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses and long term obligations 
we consider investments that  when purchased  have a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
the primary objectives of our investment strategy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
to minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest mainly in cash equivalents and short term investments and maintain an average maturity of six months or less 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income 
on december   we had outstanding debt recorded at million 
changes in interest rates do not affect the value of our debt or interest expense
