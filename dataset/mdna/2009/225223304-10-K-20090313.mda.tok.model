item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act  and is subject to the safe harbor created by those sections 
factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are set forth in this section and earlier in this report under item a 
risk factors  beginning on page the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview and executive summary we design  develop  manufacture  market and service high performance computing hpc systems  commonly known as supercomputers 
our supercomputer systems provide capability  capacity and sustained performance far beyond typical server based computer systems and address challenging scientific and engineering computing problems 
over the past three years  we have expanded our worldwide customer base  refined our product roadmap  increased our total addressable market  established a lower operating cost model and sharpened our focus on execution to meet customer expectations and improve our financial operating results 
we believe we are well positioned to meet the demanding needs of the high end of the hpc market by providing superior supercomputer systems with performance and cost advantages when sustained performance on challenging applications and total cost of ownership are taken into account 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily by concentrating our research and development efforts on the processing  interconnect and system capabilities that enable our supercomputers to scale that is  to continue to increase performance as they grow in size 
in addition  we have demonstrated expertise in several processor technologies 
purpose built for the supercomputer market  our systems balance highly capable processors  highly scalable system software and very high speed interconnect and communications capabilities 
our plans for and beyond are based on gaining market share in the supercomputer market segment  extending our technology leadership  maintaining our focus on execution and profitability and continuing to expand our total addressable market through broadening our engineering services offerings  including our custom engineering projects  and selling our new cray cx system  our first system based on intel processors  and our new cray xtm system 
summary of results revenue increased by million  or  in compared to  with an million increase in product revenue and an million increase in service revenue 
the increase in product revenue was principally due to increased cray xt system sales  including approximately million from the acceptance of a petaflops 
table of contents system at oak ridge national laboratory  with the increase in service revenue primarily due to increased engineering services revenue 
loss from operations increased in to a loss of million compared to a loss from operations of million in due to a goodwill impairment charge of million and an million increase in core operating expenses  offsetting a million increase in gross profit 
net cash used in operations was million principally due to increased working capital levels 
net cash provided by operations in was million 
net cash defined as cash and short term investment balances  including restricted cash balances  less our convertible notes decreased by million during market overview and challenges in recent years the most significant trends in the hpc industry have been the commoditization of hpc hardware  particularly processors and interconnect systems  the growing commoditization of software  including plentiful building blocks and more capable open source software  electrical power requirements becoming a design constraint and driver in total cost of ownership determinations  increased micro architectural diversity  including many core processors with vector extensions and growing experimentation with accelerators  as the rate of per core performance has decreased  and data needs growing faster than computational needs 
these trends have resulted in the expansion and acceptance of lower bandwidth cluster systems using processors manufactured by intel  amd and others with commercially available commodity networking and other components throughout the hpc market  especially in capacity  or throughput  computing situations 
these systems may offer higher theoretical peak performance for equivalent cost  and price peak performance is often the dominant factor in hpc procurements outside of the high end supercomputer market segment 
vendors of such systems often put pricing pressure on us in competitive procurements  even at times in larger procurements where time to solution is of significant importance 
in the markets for larger systems costing well over million  the use of commodity processors and networking components is resulting in increasing data transfer bottlenecks as these components do not balance processor power with network communication capability 
with the arrival of increasing processor core counts due to quad core and soon many core processors  these unbalanced systems will typically have even lower productivity  especially in larger systems running more complex applications 
vendors have also begun to augment standard microprocessors with other processor types in order to increase computational power  further complicating programming models 
in addition  with increasing scale  bandwidth and processor core counts  large computer systems use progressively higher amounts of power to operate and require special cooling capabilities 
we believe we are well positioned to meet the market s demanding needs  as we concentrate our research and development efforts on the processing  interconnect  system software and packaging capabilities that enable our supercomputers to perform at scale that is  to continue to increase actual performance as systems grow ever larger in size 
we have demonstrated expertise in several processor technologies massively parallel processing  multithreading  vector processing and co processing with field programmable gate arrays 
further  we offer unique capabilities in high speed  high bandwidth interconnect design  compiler technology  system software and packaging capabilities 
our experience and capabilities across each of these fronts are becoming ever more important  especially in larger procurements 
we expect to be in a comparatively advantageous position as larger many core processors become available and as multiple processing technologies become integrated into single systems 
in addition  we intend to expand our addressable market by leveraging our technologies and customer base  the cray brand and industry trends by introducing complementary products and services to new and existing customers  as demonstrated by our emphasis on custom engineering projects and the introduction of our new cray cx and cray xtm systems 

table of contents key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
product revenue generally constitutes the major portion of our revenue in any reporting period and  for the reasons discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  is subject to significant variability from period to period 
in the short term  we closely review the status of product shipments  installations and acceptances in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts  longer term  we monitor the status of the pipeline of product sales opportunities and product development cycles 
revenue growth is the best indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of increased market share in the markets we address 
the introduction of the cray xt family and our longer term product roadmap  including our collaboration with intel  are efforts to increase product revenue 
product revenue increased significantly in compared to due in part to our launch of the cray xt system  especially the acceptance of a cray xt petaflops supercomputer at oak ridge national laboratory 
we also plan to increase our engineering services offerings  which include our custom engineering team  and market new products  such as the cray cx and cray xtm systems  to increase revenue 
maintenance service revenue is more constant in the short term and assists  in part  to offset the impact that the variability in product revenue has on total revenue 
gross profit 
our total gross profit and our product gross profit for were each  reflecting increases from the respective levels of and 
total gross profit for was favorably impacted by product mix and a nonrecurring engineering services project that concluded in the first quarter of we need to focus on maintaining and improving our product gross profit over the long term  which we believe is best achieved through product differentiation  although we expect product gross profit to decline in principally due to a low gross profit million system sale 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven largely by headcount  the level of recognized co funding for research and development and contracted third party research and development services 
as part of our ongoing efforts to control operating expenses  we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
our november darpa phase iii award is in line with our long term development path 
this award  however  likely will result in increases in gross and net research and development expenditures by us in future periods due to the size of the overall program and the cost sharing requirement on our part 
operating expenses for  excluding the million goodwill impairment charge  were approximately million greater than  driven largely by higher net research and development expenses and significantly higher variable pay and commission expense 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in product revenue  our cash position also varies from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
we closely monitor our expected cash levels  particularly in light of increased inventory purchases for large system installations and the risk of delays in product shipments and acceptances and  longer term  in product development 
sustained profitability over annual periods is our primary objective  which should improve our cash position and shareholder value 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap  there are certain accounting policies that are particularly important 
these include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  research and development expenses and share based compensation 
we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
in some cases  these policies represent required accounting 
in other cases  they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation 

table of contents additionally  we consider certain judgments and estimates to be significant  including those relating to the fair value determination used in revenue recognition  percentage of completion accounting  estimates of proportional performance on co funded engineering contracts and prepaid engineering services  determination of inventory at the lower of cost or market  useful lives for depreciation and amortization  determination of future cash flows associated with impairment testing for long lived assets  determination of the fair value of stock options and other assessments of fair value  calculation of deferred income tax assets  potential income tax assessments and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to our customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no significant unfulfilled obligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record revenue in our consolidated statements of operations net of any sales  use  value added or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are our statements of policy with regard to multiple element arrangements and specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue 
multiple element arrangements 
we commonly enter into transactions that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of hardware  maintenance and other services 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and all of the following criteria are met  revenue for the delivered element is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of such item the element could be sold separately  the fair value of the undelivered element is established  and in cases with any general right of return  our performance with respect to any undelivered element is within our control and probable 
if all of the criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until delivery of the last element as the elements would not be considered a separate unit of accounting and revenue would be recognized as described below under our product or service revenue recognition policies 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period and accordingly allocate a portion of the sales price as a separate deliverable which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period 
products 
we recognize revenue from sales of our products other than the cray cx system upon customer acceptance of the system  when we have no significant unfulfilled obligations stipulated by the contract that affect the customer s final acceptance  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
a customer signed notice of acceptance or similar document is typically required from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of our cray cx product is generally recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
project revenue 
revenue from contracts that require us to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex hpc systems to a customer s specifications is recognized using the percentage of completion method for long term development projects under american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
percentage of completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs 
total estimated costs are based on several factors  including estimated labor hours to complete certain tasks and the estimated cost of purchased components or services 
estimates may need to be adjusted from quarter to quarter  which would impact revenue and gross profit on a cumulative basis 
to the extent the estimate of total costs to complete the contract indicates a loss  such amount is recognized in full in the period that the determination is made 

table of contents services 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods  often with prepayments for the term of the contract 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product  which may include a warranty period 
we allocate a portion of the sales price to maintenance service revenue based on estimates of fair value 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
we consider fiscal funding clauses as contingencies for the recognition of revenue until the funding is virtually assured 
revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are performed 
inventory valuation we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness and anticipated future demand of our inventory components 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
additionally  during periods of product or inventory component upgrades or transitions  we may acquire significant quantities of inventory to support estimated current and future production and service requirements 
as a result  it is possible that older inventory items we have purchased may become obsolete  be sold below cost or be deemed in excess of quantities required for production or service requirements 
when we determine it is not likely we will recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we also may have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets during the fourth quarter of  we determined that our goodwill as of november   was fully impaired 
as a consequence  we have no recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence  which includes  among other things  our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  against which we provided a million valuation allowance 
our net deferred tax assets of million were generated in foreign jurisdictions where we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these assets through future operations 
research and development expenses research and development costs include costs incurred in the development and production of our hardware and software  costs incurred to enhance and support existing product features and expenses related to future product development 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  and may be offset by co funding from the us government 
we may also enter into arrangements whereby we make advance  non refundable payments to a 
table of contents vendor to perform certain research and development services 
these payments are deferred and recognized over the vendor s estimated performance period 
amounts to be received under co funding arrangements with the us government are based on either contractual milestones or costs incurred 
these co funding milestone payments are recognized in operations as performance is estimated to be completed and are measured as milestone achievements occur or as costs are incurred 
these estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and are subject to change  including in the near term 
if an estimate is changed  net research and development expense could be impacted significantly 
we do not record a receivable from the us government prior to completing the requirements necessary to bill for a milestone or cost reimbursement 
funding from the us government is subject to certain budget restrictions and milestones may be subject to completion risk  and as such  there may be periods in which research and development costs are expensed as incurred for which no reimbursement is recorded  as milestones have not been completed or the us government has not funded an agreement 
we classify amounts to be received from funded research and development projects as either revenue or a reduction to research and development expense  based on the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement  considering total costs expected to be incurred compared to total expected funding and the nature of the research and development contractual arrangement 
in the event that a particular arrangement is determined to represent revenue  the corresponding research and development costs are classified as cost of revenue 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
r  share based payment fas r 
estimates of fair value of stock options are based upon the black scholes option pricing model 
we utilize assumptions related to stock price volatility  stock option term and forfeiture rates that are based upon both historical factors as well as management s judgment 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement was adopted during the first quarter of and did not have any effect on our financial position or operating results 
effective january   we implemented fas no 
 fair value measurement fas  for our financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at each reporting period  and non financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at least annually 
in accordance with the provisions of fasb staff position fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 we elected to defer implementation of fas as it relates to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until january  we do not expect the adoption of fas as it relates to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position 
in march  the fasb issued fas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas which requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information that should enable financial statement users to understand how and why a company uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
we will adopt fas in since fas requires only additional disclosures concerning derivative and hedging activities  adoption of fas will not affect our consolidated financial position or our results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb  which states that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash 
table of contents settlement are not addressed by paragraph of accounting principles board opinion no 
and that issuers of such instruments should account separately for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
upon adoption of fsp apb  on january   we will retrospectively apply the change in accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if the principle had always been used 
the adoption of fsp apb will result in an estimated increase to non cash interest expense in of approximately million assuming the december  balance of the notes remain outstanding until december  
upon retrospective application in  the adoption will also result in an increase of non cash interest expense of million in  principally for the accretion of the liability component of the notes 
our million non operating gain on the repurchase of million principal amount of our notes in will be restated to a  non operating loss 
adoption of fsp apb will also result in the following balance sheet impacts at december   a reduction of debt by approximately million  a decrease in deferred loan costs of  an increase in additional paid in capital by million and an increase in accumulated deficit of million 
we are continuing to analyze the tax impacts of adopting the new standard  but currently expect that adoption will not result in any significant change to our net deferred income tax asset 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active 
the fsp was effective upon issuance  including periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
the fsp clarified the application of fas in an inactive market and provided an illustrative example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
the adoption of fsp fas did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fsp r  employer s disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
fsp r is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the fsp provides guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other post retirement plan 
we do not expect the adoption of fsp r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenue and gross profit our product and service revenue for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  product revenue less cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross profit percentage service revenue less cost of service revenue service gross profit service gross profit percentage total revenue less total cost of revenue total gross profit total gross profit percentage product revenue product revenue in increased million  or  over due to increased sales of our cray xt system  which included approximately million from the petaflops system at oak ridge national laboratory  
table of contents and cray xth systems  offset in part by lower sales of cray xt and cray xt systems 
project revenue for was million compared to million in as we completed the final deliverables under the red storm development contract 
product revenue in decreased million  or  over due to delays in component availability and product development that adversely affected our ability to deliver and recognize revenue from our quad core cray xt  cray xth and cray xmt systems that had been anticipated at the beginning of the year 
additionally  as anticipated  project revenue decreased to million in compared to project revenue of million in  largely due to the completion of the darpa phase ii project in while a wide range of potential results is possible  we expect that for  product revenue will decrease by approximately million to million from levels  with less revenue from cray xt systems offset in part by sales of cray cx systems 
service revenue service revenue for increased million  or  from  primarily due to a million increase in custom engineering and other engineering services  including a million nonrecurring project completed in the first quarter of service revenue for decreased million  or  over  as a result of decreased maintenance revenue of approximately million and lower revenue from engineering services of million due to the end of a refurbishment contract in for  we expect increased service revenue  including more than million from custom engineering services and an increase of about million in maintenance services over levels 
cost of product revenue and product gross profit product gross profit percentage improved percentage points in compared to this improvement in product gross profit was due to improved product mix offsetting a  higher charge for excess and obsolete inventory 
product gross profit percentage improved percentage points in compared to this improvement in product gross profit was due primarily to increased gross profit across all product lines  including million lower red storm and darpa phase ii low gross profit project revenue and million lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
this increase was partially offset by the settlement of certain contract penalties for deliveries that were delayed and or did not meet contractual performance requirements 
the red storm and darpa phases i and ii project costs  totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively  are reflected on our consolidated financial statements as cost of product revenue and the related reimbursements are recorded in our consolidated financial statements as product revenue 
excluding these development projects  product gross profit in  and would have been   and  respectively 
we expect product gross profit percentage to decrease by about to percentage points in compared to levels primarily due to the impact of a low gross profit million contract 
cost of service revenue and service gross profit service gross profit percentage declined one percentage point in as compared to as the million increase in service revenue was offset by an increase in cost of service revenue of million due primarily to increased headcount and related expenses of million primarily driven by the ramp up of our custom engineering services and increased variable pay expense of million 
despite a decrease in cost of service revenue of million in compared to  service gross profit percentage declined three percentage points in compared to due to the decrease in maintenance revenue and the end of a high gross profit engineering services contract in 
table of contents we expect service gross profit percentage to be at similar levels as in and  with increased service revenue being offset proportionately by increased costs  primarily personnel and outside services related to additional custom engineering activity 
operating expenses research and development research and development expenses for the indicated years ended december were as follows in thousands  except for percentages december  gross research and development expenses less amounts included in cost of revenue less reimbursed research and development excludes amounts in revenue net research and development expenses percentage of total revenue gross research and development expenses in the table above reflect all research and development expenditures  including expenses related to our research and development activities on the red storm and darpa phases ii and iii projects 
research and development expenses on the red storm and darpa phase ii projects are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as cost of product revenue  and government co funding on our other projects  including the darpa phase iii project  is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as reimbursed research and development 
research and development expenses include personnel expenses  depreciation  allocations for certain overhead expenses  software  prototype materials and outside contracted engineering expenses 
in  gross research and development expenses increased million from levels due to increased spending on the darpa phase iii project  which was partially offset by decreased spending on our cray xth system formerly known as our blackwidow project 
increases in variable pay expense of million were a significant driver of the overall increase 
reimbursed research and development decreased in compared to as lower amounts recognized related to the cray xth system were partially offset by increased darpa phase iii recognized reimbursements 
during the fourth quarter of  we amended the darpa phase iii agreement to incorporate intel technologies into our development project and establish later delivery dates  new milestones and new payment dates and amounts 
we are still required to spend million on our darpa phase iii project in order to receive million of co funding 
as of december   we had received million of the anticipated million of darpa co funding 
in  gross research and development expenses decreased from levels primarily due to decreases in expenses for our cray xth systems and our cray xt  cray xd and other scalar systems  offset in part by increased expenditures on our darpa phase iii project 
for  net research and development expenses increased as compared to due principally to decreases in government reimbursement for our cray xth system  darpa phase ii and cray xmt system  offset in part by increased co funding for our darpa phase iii project 
the result was aggregate decreases in government reimbursements exceeding the decrease in gross research and development expenses 
for  we expect gross research and development expenses to increase  primarily due to increased expenditures on our darpa phase iii contract  including non recurring engineering expenses  offsetting declines in variable pay compensation  while net research and development expenses are expected to decline slightly due to lower variable compensation and increased levels of recognized government co funding 
stock based compensation included in research and development expense may increase from levels due to our stock option repurchase tender offer 

table of contents other operating expenses our sales and marketing  general and administrative and restructuring  severance and impairment charges for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  sales and marketing percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue restructuring  severance and impairment percentage of total revenue sales and marketing 
the million increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared to is due to principally to million higher commission and variable pay expense and million on increased headcount and associated employee related costs 
the slight increase in sales and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily due to higher personnel costs partially offset by lower sales commissions for product sales 
for  we expect sales and marketing expense to be similar to levels  with increased headcount and marketing expenses partially offsetting decreases in variable pay compensation and commissions 
stock based compensation included in sales and marketing expense may increase from levels due to our stock option repurchase tender offer 
general and administrative 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in over is primarily due to higher variable pay expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative costs for compared to was primarily due to decreases in variable pay and retention compensation program expense  decreases in headcount expenses and lower costs for audit  sarbanes oxley compliance and legal fees 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease slightly from levels due to decreases in variable pay compensation 
stock based compensation included in general and administrative expense may increase from levels due to our stock option repurchase tender offer 
restructuring  severance and impairment 
during  restructuring  severance and impairment expense resulted entirely from an impairment charge of our entire november  goodwill balance 
during  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees and incurred additional severance charges primarily for the retirement of our former chief executive officer 
during  we incurred million of severance and other exit costs related to these actions 
during  we recognized a  favorable impact due to a change in estimate for certain benefits 
no new restructuring efforts were implemented in  or other income expense  net for the year ended december   we recognized million of net other income due principally to a million gain on the repurchase of million principal amount of our notes at a discount 
for the year ended december   we recognized net other income of million due principally to foreign exchange transaction gains  including approximately  related to a foreign exchange gain on a forward foreign exchange contract prior to its designation as a cash flow hedge 
for the year ended december   we recognized net other expense of million  principally as the result of foreign exchange losses in connection with a forward foreign exchange contract 

table of contents interest income expense  net our interest income and interest expense for the indicated years ended december were in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense net interest income expense interest income in decreased as compared to due to lower average invested balances and lower short term interest rates

taxes we recorded income tax expense of  million and  in  and  respectively  which reflects tax expense for local  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
in  current us federal income alternative minimum tax was offset by amounts receivable as a result of tax legislation that was enacted during enabling a corporation to recover certain previously generated us research and development income tax credits 
there was no current provision for us federal income taxes in and we have income taxes currently payable related to our operations in certain foreign countries and in certain states 
as of december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will expire between through  if not utilized 
net income loss net loss was million in  million in and million in the loss was the result of the million goodwill impairment charge 
without this charge  our increase in gross profit would have offset the increases in net research and development expense and variable pay compensation  including sales commissions 
the loss included higher net research and development expense offsetting increased gross profit  higher interest and other income and lower general and administrative and restructuring  severance and impairment expense 
the loss included low gross profit on product revenue recognized for a cray x xe installation  million in inventory write downs and a million charge for an intellectual property license agreement 
for  while there is a wide range of potential outcomes  we currently expect total revenue in the range of million with a small operating loss 
quarterly revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of system acceptances  however  we currently anticipate quarterly revenue will be weighted more evenly throughout than in previous years 
overall gross profit percentage is expected to decline to the low to mid thirty percent range  driven primarily by the impact of a low gross profit contract for approximately million 
core operating expenses  defined as net research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  are anticipated to be lower 
table of contents by approximately million from levels 
net other income and expense is not expected to be significant in income tax expense is anticipated to be approximately million 
our quarterly and annual results in will be affected by many factors  including the level and timing of government funding  the timing and success of planned product rollouts  the timing and success of meeting certain product development milestones and the timing of customer orders  shipments  acceptances  revenue recognition and gross profit contribution

for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities included million from our december common stock offering and million of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan 
over the next twelve months  our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory and spare parts  outside engineering expenses particularly as we continue development of our cray xt and successor systems and internally fund a portion of the expenses on our cascade project pursuant to the darpa phase iii award  the anticipated repayment of our notes and the related interest expense and the acquisition of property and equipment 
our capital budget for property and equipment is approximately million 
in addition  we lease certain equipment and facilities used in our operations under 
table of contents operating leases in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands amounts committed by year less than contractual obligations total year years years thereafter development agreements operating leases unrecognized income tax benefits total contractual cash obligations we have million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes due in the notes bear interest at an annual rate of  and holders of the notes may require us to purchase the notes on december   december  and december  or upon the occurrence of certain events provided in the indenture governing the notes 
we expect that we likely will be required to purchase the remaining notes on december   pursuant to a put option held by the holders of the notes 
in august  we amended our line of credit reducing the maximum line of credit to million from million 
this facility expires june  as of december   million of the line of credit supported outstanding letters of credit and we were eligible to use the remaining million  however  this amount is subject to fluctuations related to foreign currency exchange rates on the outstanding letters of credit 
in our normal course of operations  we have development arrangements under which we engage outside engineering resources to work on our research and development projects 
for the twelve months ended december   we incurred million for such arrangements 
at any particular time  our cash position is affected by the timing of cash receipts for product sales  maintenance contracts  government co funding for research and development activities and our payments for inventory  engineering and other services  resulting in significant fluctuations in our cash balance from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations 
we expect that net cash cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments less our notes during generally will be above the year end level 
we do not anticipate needing to borrow from our credit line  and we expect our cash resources to be adequate for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of our cash resources is dependent on the amount and timing of government funding as well as our ability to sell our products  particularly the cray xt and successor systems and the cray cx system  and to engage in custom engineering projects with adequate gross profit 
beyond the next twelve months  the adequacy of our cash resources will largely depend on our success in re establishing profitable operations and positive operating cash flows on a sustained basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we invest our available cash in investment grade debt instruments of corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
we do not have any derivative instruments or auction rate securities in our investment portfolio 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a percent change in interest rates would not be significant 

table of contents the table below presents fair values and related weighted average interest rate by investment class at december  in thousands  except for percentages 
the average maturity of these investments is less than six months with a credit quality range of a a to aaa aaa 
weighted averaged interest fair value maturities rate corporate notes and bonds foreign currency risk we sell our products primarily in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced based on us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we often sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts may call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  or engage with our foreign subsidiaries in transactions deemed to be short term in nature  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
as of december   we have entered into forward exchange contracts that hedge approximately million of anticipated cash receipts on specific foreign currency denominated sales contracts 
these forward contracts hedge the risk of foreign exchange rate changes between the time that the related contracts were signed and when the cash receipts are expected to be received 
our foreign maintenance contracts are typically paid in local currencies and provide a partial natural hedge against foreign exchange exposure 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates could impact our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately
