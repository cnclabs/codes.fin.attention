item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the information described under the caption risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a developer  manufacturer and supplier of medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical products focused on the healthcare needs of women 
our core business segments are focused on breast health  diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
historically  we have developed  manufactured and marketed products focused on mammography  breast care and osteoporosis assessment 
we have historically focused our resources on developing systems and subsystems offering superior image quality and diagnostic accuracy  which has enabled us to capture significant market share and customer loyalty  despite the presence of large competitors 
our merger with cytyc in the first quarter of fiscal enabled us to benefit from cytyc s strengths in the fields of obstetrics  gynecology  radiation oncology and minimally invasive surgery 
our breast health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories  including digital and film based mammography systems  computer aided detection cad  minimally invasive breast biopsy and tissue extraction devices  breast biopsy guidance systems  breast imaging comfort pads  and breast brachytherapy products 
we have also developed a new breast imaging platform  dimensions  which utilizes a new technology  tomosynthesis  to produce three dimensional d images  as well as conventional two dimensional d full field digital mammography ffdm images 
in the us  our dimensions product has been approved by the fda for providing conventional d images  and we are conducting further clinical trials to support our pma application for the d configuration 
our dimensions platform received ce mark approval in europe in fiscal and canadian registration in march  both for d and d modes of imaging 
currently  we cannot determine the timing of fda approval for our d configuration  if at all 
we also sell breast biopsy products  and within our breast brachytherapy products is our mammosite system  which 
table of contents provides accelerated partial breast irradiation technology 
we received fda clearance for our mammosite ml radiation therapy system  which is a multi lumen device that provides the oncologist with additional flexibility in specifically targeting radiation in the tissue where cancer is most likely to recur  on august  our diagnostic products include the thinprep system  which is primarily used in cytology testing applications  such as cervical cancer screening  and the rapid fetal fibronectin test  which assists physicians in assessing risk of pre term birth 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired third wave technologies  inc third wave a company that develops and markets molecular diagnostic reagents for a wide variety of dna and rna analysis applications based on its proprietary invader chemistry 
our current clinical diagnostic offerings based upon this invader chemistry include products to assist in the diagnosis of human papillomavirus hpv  cystic fibrosis  cardiovascular risk and other diseases 
we received fda approval of cervista hpv high risk hr and cervista hpv tests in march as well as ce mark approval in europe in january for cervista hpv hr and in may for cervista hpv our gyn surgical products are made up of the novasure system and the adiana permanent contraception system adiana system 
the novasure system enables physicians to treat women suffering from excessive menstrual bleeding in a minimally invasive manner in order to eliminate or reduce their bleeding 
the adiana system is a form of permanent female contraception intended as an alternative to tubal ligation 
we received fda approval of the adiana system in july and ce mark approval in europe in our revenues from the adiana system have been modest to date as both the us and international market launches were limited 
our skeletal health products primarily consist of dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product  our fluoroscan mini c arm imaging product and our esaote line of extremity magnetic resonance imaging mri systems that were manufactured by an original equipment manufacturer 
recent developments market acceptance of our medical products in the united states and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers  patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patient s medical expenses by government healthcare programs  private insurers or other healthcare payors 
since the end of calendar  the uncertainty surrounding world financial markets and deteriorating worldwide macroeconomic conditions have caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities 
additionally  constrictions in world credit markets have caused and continue to cause our customers to experience increased difficulty securing the financing necessary to purchase our products 
economic uncertainty has and may continue to result in cost conscious consumers focusing on acute care rather than wellness  which could adversely affect demand for our products and procedures 
furthermore  governments and other third party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered  which could adversely effect sales of our products 
if the current adverse economic conditions continue  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including efforts at national healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office based healthcare practitioners 
we anticipate that the current administration  congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access 
public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future 
at this time  we cannot predict which  if any  healthcare reform proposals will be adopted  when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on our business 
healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the united states and in many foreign countries could limit the use of our products and treatments  
table of contents reduce reimbursement available for such use  or adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted 
these reforms or cost containment measures  including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect  could have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and treatments and could harm our business and prospects 
as we operate in a highly regulated industry  other governmental actions may adversely affect our business  operations or financial condition  including  without limitation new laws  regulations or judicial decisions  or new interpretations of existing laws  regulations or decisions  related to health care availability  method of delivery and payment for health care products and services  changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and treatments and result in lost market opportunity  changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring  labeling changes  restrictions on product distribution or use  or other measures after the introduction of our products and treatments to market  which could increase our costs of doing business  adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products or treatments  or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments  new laws  regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices  and changes in the tax laws relating to our operations  including those associated with proposed health care reform  such as the tax proposal included in the health care reform bill recently approved by the finance committee of the us senate that would assess an annual tax on the revenue of medical device manufacturers based upon market share  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
professional societies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines  recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities from time to time 
recommendations of government agencies or these other groups organizations may relate to such matters as usage  cost effectiveness  and use of related therapies 
organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors 
recommendations  guidelines or studies that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of our products 
for example  recently  the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists changed their recommendations for pap smear screening  and the united states preventive services task force changed their recommendations for mammography screening 
these new recommendations  if implemented  could significantly reduce the amount of screening using our thinprep  mammography and related products and adversely affect the sale of those products 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the value of the us dollar strengthened against the value of many foreign currencies and remained at this strengthened position throughout our second quarter of fiscal however  in our fiscal third quarter  the dollar weakened slightly and continued to weaken in the fourth quarter 
a majority of our sales to international dealers are denominated in us dollars 
the ongoing fluctuations of the value of the us dollar may cause our products to be less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and margins over time 
in addition  we have international sales  principally in our diagnostics segment  that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the value of these sales is also impacted by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets  foreign currency fluctuations may be significant in the future  and if the us dollar strengthens  we may experience a material adverse effect on our international sales and margins 

table of contents acquisitions fiscal acquisitions third wave technologies  inc on july   we completed our acquisition of third wave pursuant to a definitive agreement dated june  we paid per share of third wave  for an estimated aggregate purchase price of million  including million for the estimated fair value of fully vested stock based awards and million in acquisition related expenses 
we concluded that the acquisition of third wave did not represent a material business combination and therefore no pro forma financial information has been provided herein 
our results of operations include the results of third wave since the acquisition date  as a component of our diagnostics reporting segment 
our acquisition of third wave was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the total purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the excess of purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill 
as a result of this acquisition  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and we have recorded additional amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets and additional interest expense on the funds we borrowed to complete the acquisition in both fiscal and the allocation of the purchase price was based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of july  we finalized the allocation of the purchase price in fiscal once we had all necessary information to complete our estimates 
the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on information and assumptions further described below 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation  million of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in process research and development projects 
the amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development represents programs for which some research and development has been completed  but technological feasibility has not been determined or fda approval is pending 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to these projects using a discount rate of 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
the fair value attributable to these in process projects was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the transaction as a whole 
the most significant acquired in process technology related to the cervista hpv hr screening  for which we estimated a value of million 
at the time of  and subsequent to the acquisition  we sold hpv reagents that detect certain high risk hpv types as analyte specific reagents asrs 
in  third wave began clinical trials for pma submissions to the fda for cervista hpv hr 
third wave submitted the pmas in april and received fda approval in the second quarter of fiscal since receiving fda approval  we have begun to transition to only selling hpv ivds and expect to complete this transition by the end of fiscal the hpv in process research and development related only to the hpv ivds and the hpv asrs were valued as developed technology 
the estimated cost to complete third wave s remaining in process research and development projects as of september  in the aggregate was million 

table of contents on july   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with goldman sachs credit partners lp and certain other lenders and borrowed million under that facility to finance our acquisition of third wave 
cytyc corporation on october   we completed our merger with cytyc  pursuant to which cytyc became our wholly owned subsidiary 
under the terms of the merger agreement  cytyc shareholders received shares of our common stock and in cash for each share of cytyc common stock held by them 
the aggregate consideration we paid for cytyc  including liabilities assumed in connection with the transaction  was billion comprised as follows merger consideration paid to the former cytyc stockholders of billion  consisting of approximately billion in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of approximately billion  million of fully vested stock options issued upon conversion of cytyc stock options with an estimated fair value of approximately million  the assumption of obligations of cytyc under its senior convertible notes due with a principal amount outstanding as of october  of approximately million and an estimated fair value of approximately million  and direct acquisition costs of million 
in connection with the merger  we entered into a credit agreement relating to a senior secured credit facility with goldman sachs credit partners lp and certain other lenders  in which the lenders committed to provide  in the aggregate  senior secured financing of up to approximately billion to pay for the cash portion of the merger consideration  for repayment of existing debt of cytyc  for expenses relating to the merger and for working capital following the completion of the merger 
as of the closing of the merger  we borrowed billion under the credit facility 
in december  we refinanced a substantial portion of this credit facility through the issuance of convertible senior notes due in the principal amount of billion 
on july   after having paid off all outstanding term loans under the credit facility  we amended and restated the credit facility to finance our acquisition of third wave 
our merger with cytyc was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and we were considered to be the acquirer of cytyc for accounting purposes 
our results of operations after completion of the merger include the operations of cytyc 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded an in process research and development of million in the first quarter of fiscal  and we have recorded increased amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets and additional interest on the funds we borrowed to complete the merger in both fiscal and we have allocated the purchase price for our merger with cytyc to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of their estimated fair values 
we then allocated the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on information and assumptions further described below 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets as part of the purchase price allocation  we determined that cytyc s identifiable intangible assets include existing technology  customer relationships and trade names 
cytyc s existing technology relates to patents  patent applications and know how with respect to the technologies embedded in its currently marketed products 

table of contents in determining the allocation of the purchase price to existing technology  consideration was only given to patent and patent applications that relate to products that have been approved by the fda 
cytyc s customer relationship assets relate to relationships that cytyc s sales force has developed with ob gyns  breast surgeons  clinical laboratories and other physicians 
the trade names relate to both the cytyc name as well as key product names 
we used the income approach to value the existing technology and marketing based intangibles 
this approach calculates fair value by discounting the after tax cash flows back to a present value 
the baseline data for this analysis was the cash flow estimates used to price the transaction 
cash flows were forecasted for each intangible asset  and then discounted based on an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rates applied were benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return from the transaction model as well as cytyc s weighted average cost of capital based on the capital asset pricing model 
in estimating the useful life of the acquired assets  we considered asc  intangible goodwill and other  subsection formerly paragraph of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which lists the pertinent factors to be considered when estimating the useful life of an intangible asset 
these factors included a review of the expected use by the combined company of the assets acquired  the expected useful life of another asset or group of assets related to the acquired assets  legal  regulatory or other contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of an acquired asset or may enable the extension of the useful life of an acquired asset without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset 
we are amortizing these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives either using a method that is based on estimated future cash flows as we believe this will approximate the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be utilized  or on a straightline basis if those cash flows are not reliably determinable 
acquired in process research and development as part of the purchase price allocation for our merger with cytyc  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to acquired in process research and development projects 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to in process projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the date of the merger 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
the fair value attributable to these in process projects was expensed at the time of the merger 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the transaction as a whole 
the fair value assigned to acquired in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the acquired in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations and the implied rate of return from the transaction model plus a risk premium 
due to the nature of the forecasts and the risks associated with the developmental projects  appropriate risk adjusted discount rates were used for the in process research and development projects 
the discount rates are based on the stage of completion and uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology projects 

table of contents the acquired in process research and development of cytyc related to the following research and development projects adiana system and expanded labeling of the novasure system  gestiva  the thinprep imaging system  the thinprep processor and helica 
the most significant acquired in process technology related to the adiana system for which we estimated a value of approximately million 
the system is an incisionless trans cervical permanent sterilization device intended to be used during an office or hospital based procedure 
in january  the fda requested an additional year of clinical trial data for the product  and in july  we received fda approval for the product 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our rights to gestiva  a drug being developed to be used in the prevention of preterm birth in pregnant women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth  to k v pharmaceutical company for a total purchase price of million 
a portion of the purchase price is to be paid upon final approval by the fda of a gestiva new drug application nda on or before february  and the production of a quantity of gestiva suitable to enable the commercial launch of the product 
either party has the right to terminate the agreement if fda approval is not obtained by february  in fiscal  we received million of the purchase price  and the balance is due upon the satisfaction of the above conditions 
we have agreed to continue our efforts to obtain fda approval of the nda for gestiva as part of this arrangement  for which we are being reimbursed by k v pharmaceutical 
all costs incurred in these efforts are to be reimbursed by k v pharmaceutical and are being recorded as a credit against research and development expenses 
we have recorded the million as a deferred gain within current liabilities of our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect the gain will be recognized upon the closing of the transaction following final fda approval of the gestiva nda or if the agreement is terminated 
we had allocated million to acquired in process research for this product as part of the initial purchase price allocation 
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain the requisite fda approval  that the transaction will be completed or that we will receive the balance of the purchase price 
moreover  if k v pharmaceutical terminates the agreement as a result of our breach of a material representation  warranty  covenant or agreement  we will be required to return the funds previously received by us as well as expenses reimbursed to us by k v 
subsequent to the merger with cytyc  we decided to discontinue the development of cytyc s helica thermal coagulator system product 
we will not incur any further costs or realize any future cash flows from this product 
our intangible asset valuation for cytyc included million related to customer relationships for helica 
as a result of the helica product discontinuation  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal the other in process research and development projects we acquired in our merger with cytyc were at different stages of development  ranging from the early stages of development to phase iib prototype building  ongoing clinical trials and submission to the fda of pma and drug applications 
fda approval or clearance had not been granted for any of the products classified as in process research and development  nor had cytyc received any foreign approvals or clearances for any of these products 
all products classified as in process research and development require various levels of in house and external testing  clinical trials and approvals from the fda before these future products can be marketed 
the estimated cash requirements to complete the remaining products as of september  were expected to be approximately million 
the successful development of new products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  both known and unknown  including  unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  technical problems and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products and enhancements  including  for example changes requested by the fda in connection with pma or nda applications for products or k notification 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot provide assurance that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents goodwill the purchase price allocation for cytyc initially resulted in goodwill of approximately billion 
the factors contributing to the recognition of this amount of goodwill were based upon several strategic and synergistic benefits that were expected to be realized from the combination 
these benefits include the expectation that our complementary products and technologies will create a leading women s healthcare company with an enhanced presence in hospitals  private practices and healthcare organizations 
we also expected to realize substantial synergies through the use of cytyc s ob gyn and breast surgeon sales channel to cross sell our existing and future products 
our merger with cytyc provided us broader channel coverage within the united states and expanded geographic reach internationally  as well as increased scale and scope for further expanding operations through product development and complementary strategic transactions 
as a result of the company s interim impairment analysis of goodwill as of december   the company recorded an impairment charge of billion related to the goodwill from the merger with cytyc 
see the critical accounting policies below for additional information pertaining to the interim impairment analysis of the company s goodwill 
fiscal acquisition biolucent  inc on september   we completed the acquisition of biolucent  inc biolucent pursuant to a definitive agreement dated june  we have concluded that the acquisition of biolucent does not represent a material business combination and therefore no pro forma financial information has been provided herein 
biolucent  previously located in aliso viejo  california  develops  markets and sells mammopad breast cushions to decrease the discomfort associated with mammography 
prior to the acquisition  biolucent s primary research and development efforts were directed at its brachytherapy business  which was focused on breast cancer therapy 
prior to the acquisition  biolucent spun off its brachytherapy technology and business to the holders of biolucent s outstanding shares of capital stock 
as a result  we only acquired biolucent s mammopad cushion business and related assets 
we invested million directly in the spun off brachytherapy business in exchange for shares of preferred stock issued by the new business 
the aggregate purchase price for biolucent was million  consisting of million in cash and issuance of million shares of our common stock valued at million  debt assumed and paid off of million and million for acquisition related fees and expenses 
the acquisition also provided for up to two annual earn out payments not to exceed million in the aggregate based on biolucent s achievement of certain revenue targets 
we considered the provision of eitf issue no 
 accounting for contingent consideration paid to the shareholders of an acquired enterprise in a purchase business combination  and concluded that this contingent consideration will represent additional purchase price 
as a result  goodwill will be increased by the amount of the additional consideration  if any  when it becomes due and payable 
as of september   we have not recorded any amounts for these potential earn outs 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by items as shown in our consolidated statements of operations 
all dollar amounts in tables are presented in thousands 
fiscal years ended september  september  september  revenues product sales service and other revenues costs and expenses cost of product sales cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets cost of service and other revenues research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill impairment of intangible assets acquired in process research and development restructuring charges loss income from operations interest income interest expense other expense income  net loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics gyn surgical skeletal health 
table of contents in fiscal  our product sales decreased compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from our breast health products and  to a lesser extent  a million decrease in revenues from our skeletal health products  partially offset by increased revenues in our diagnostics and gyn surgical segments of million and million  respectively 
these increases were due in part to a full year of revenue for these segments in fiscal compared to the inclusion of only weeks of operating results for fiscal as we acquired these segments with the cytyc merger on october  included in the increased diagnostics revenue is additional revenue from third wave of million 
we acquired third wave in the fourth quarter of fiscal and as such had a full year of revenue in fiscal compared to weeks in fiscal breast health product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million decrease in digital mammography systems sales caused primarily by a reduction in the number of selenia full field mammography systems and related components  including our cad software  sold domestically  and to a lesser extent  internationally 
in addition  we have seen a slight deterioration of average selling prices  both domestically and internationally  driven by the current economic environment for capital purchases  and less expensive configurations of the units being sold 
also contributing to the decrease was a million decrease in multicare stereotactic table sales primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold  principally in the us we attribute the decline in sales of breast health capital equipment and related products primarily to the more difficult economic and capital spending environment 
we also experienced a decline in our mammosite single lumen products of million due to increased competition as a result of lower reimbursement rates compared to multi lumen products 
we received fda clearance for our multi lumen product on august   which we expect will improve our competitive position 
partially offsetting the declines in sales referenced above was an million increase in revenues from our breast biopsy products 
diagnostics product sales  which include thinprep  rapid fetal fibronectin test and our third wave products  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the addition of third wave revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of thinprep pap tests 
the increase in fiscal is also due to the inclusion of cytyc s results for the full fiscal year versus weeks in fiscal while we received fda approval of the cervista hpv hr and cervista hpv tests in march  the revenue contribution has been modest in fiscal gyn surgical product sales  which include our novasure system and adiana system  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in the number of novasure systems sold 
the increase is also due to the inclusion of gyn surgical s revenue for the full fiscal year versus weeks in fiscal revenues from the adiana system  which we received fda approval on july   have been modest as the us and international market launches have been limited 
we recently transferred the manufacturing of our adiana system to our new manufacturing facility in coyol  costa rica  and we are in the process of ramping up production to support the full scale launch of this product 
we could incur delays and unanticipated costs in connection with our transfer and ramping up these manufacturing operations in our new facility that could delay our full scale launch of the adiana system 
skeletal health product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million decrease in osteoporosis assessment product sales caused primarily by a decrease in the number of bone densitometry systems sold worldwide and lower average selling prices 
this product line continues to face a difficult capital equipment environment in the us and the ongoing effects of the reduction in reimbursement for osteoporosis assessment exams in the us in addition  we experienced a reduction in revenues of million in mini c arm sales and a decrease in extremity mri sales of million 
the decrease in mini c arm and extremity mri sales was due to a decrease in the number of systems sold 
in fiscal and  approximately of product sales were generated in the us  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 

table of contents service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues is primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily in our breast health segment  due to an increase in the number of service contracts executed driven by an increase in the installed base of our full field digital mammography systems and detectors 
cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets product sales gross margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the significant increase in intangible asset amortization expense of million  partially offset by the increase in sales of our higher gross margin disposable products in our diagnostics and gyn surgical segments 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal was compared to in fiscal this improvement was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our diagnostics and gyn surgical segments as a percentage of our total product sales as these products have a lower product cost as a percent of revenue compared to our breast health and skeletal health products 
in addition  our cost of product sales in fiscal included additional costs associated with the write up of acquired inventory to fair value in purchase accounting of million related to the merger with cytyc and million related to the third wave acquisition 
in fiscal  the impact of these costs was only million related to the third wave inventory write up 
our margins in fiscal were also positively impacted by our cost reduction initiatives implemented in the first half of  which included securing lower material costs from our vendors 
partially offsetting these improvements  was a decrease in gross margin in our breast health segment  primarily attributable to lower absorption of manufacturing costs due to lower volumes and to a lesser extent  a slight deterioration of average selling prices  driven by the current economic environment for capital purchases  and less expensive configurations of the units being sold 
fiscal and cost of product sales included charges of million and million  respectively  for impairment of mri inventory and a related purchase obligation  which was fulfilled in fiscal cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology  which are generally being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the 
table of contents economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
the increase in amortization expense is due partly to the method of recognition based on expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the merger with cytyc  which increased to million from million in fiscal  and a full year of third wave related amortization of million compared to million in fiscal cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to discontinue selling a certain product acquired in the third wave acquisition as a result of communications from the fda in the second quarter of regarding the approval process 
this decision was an indicator of impairment  and we performed an impairment test  which indicated the undiscounted cash flows the asset group would generate over its remaining estimated useful life would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group 
due to the insufficient cash flows to be generated  the company determined that the related asset group s fair value was de minimus and recorded an impairment charge of million comprised of developed technology of million and capitalized license fees of million 
cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues service and other revenues gross margin has improved to in fiscal from in fiscal due in part to the improved absorption of fixed service costs and the continued growth of service contract revenue  primarily in the breast health segment 
we have increased the number of service contracts due to our increased installed base of our full field digital mammography systems and detectors 
in addition  warranty costs have decreased due to lower failure rates in our products 
operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles impairment of goodwill impairment of intangibles acquired in process research and development restructuring charges research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal these increases were primarily due to a full year of expenses of million related to third wave compared to million in fiscal  and to a lesser extent a full year of operations from cytyc in 
table of contents fiscal compared to weeks in fiscal in addition  there was an increase in expenses related to the anticipated launch of the adiana system and additional clinical spending for a number of projects 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in related headcount  bonus and other discretionary areas resulting from a number of cost reduction initiatives implemented in the first half of in fiscal  we recorded a million charge related to a change in control payment associated with the merger with cytyc 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in fiscal as we conduct additional clinical trials and research to obtain fda approval for our tomosynthesis product dimensions d and continue our efforts to improve our existing products and develop next generation products 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to lower commission expenses as a result of lower product revenues  lower bonuses driven by the company s operating results  reduced advertising and trade show expenditures  and other cost reductions including lower employee headcount resulting from our cost reduction initiatives implemented in the first half of these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million related to the inclusion of a full year of operations of third wave  as well as a full year of operations from cytyc in fiscal compared to weeks in fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in the current year is primarily due to an increase of million related to the inclusion of a full year of operations of third wave  as well as a full year of operations from cytyc in fiscal compared to weeks in fiscal in addition  stock based compensation expense was higher by million in fiscal partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in bonus  headcount and related compensation  and other expenses as a result of our cost reduction initiatives implemented in the first half of amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships and trade names related to our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
the increases in these costs primarily relate to additional cytyc related amortization based on the pattern of economic benefit 
impairment of goodwill 
based upon a combination of factors  including the deteriorating macro economic environment  declines in the stock market and the decline of our market capitalization significantly below the book value of our net assets  we concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of december  as a result  we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of december  step of the impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of certain of our reporting units  acquired in connection with the cytyc acquisition  exceeded the estimated fair value of those reporting units 
as a result  we were required to complete step of the impairment analysis to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment charges 
we completed step of this analysis during the second quarter of fiscal and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion in the second quarter of fiscal refer to note in our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information 
we completed our fiscal annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of our fourth quarter and no additional impairments were recorded 
impairment of intangible assets 
subsequent to the merger with cytyc  we discontinued the development of cytyc s helica thermal coagulator system product  used for the treatment of endometriosis 
we will not realize any future cash flows from this product 
our intangible asset valuation for cytyc included approximately million related to customer relationships for helica 
as a result of the helica product discontinuation  we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal 
table of contents acquired in process research and development expenses 
the million charge for in process research and development expense is comprised of a million charge recorded in connection with our merger with cytyc and a million charge recorded in connection with the third wave acquisition 
both of these charges are described in further detail above under the respective acquisitions 
restructuring charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we closed our manufacturing facility in shanghai  china due to chinese government requirements to move the facility 
this facility  which manufactured organic photoconductor drum coatings  was acquired in connection with the aeg acquisition in  and contributed approximately million of revenue to our breast health business in fiscal in connection with this action  we recorded severance benefits and other costs of million 
the majority of employees were terminated and all termination benefits were paid as of september  additional clean up and closure costs will be recorded in fiscal  however  we do not expect these costs to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
other costs were recorded in connection with this closure of million primarily related to the impairment of manufacturing equipment  accelerated depreciation expense  and the write off of inventory  all of which was recorded in cost of product sales 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded million in compensation charges  including million in stock based compensation  related to the resignation of our former executive chairman  which was effective may  the cash payments were made during fiscal interest income 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest income interest income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decline in interest rates 
interest expense 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest expense interest expense consists primarily of the interest costs and the related amortization of deferred financing costs for both our senior secured credit agreement entered into on october  in connection with the merger with cytyc and amended on july  in connection with the third wave acquisition and our convertible notes that were issued in december to pay down a portion of the term loans  which had higher interest rates 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower term loan balances as we pay them down quarterly and lower interest rates on those balances 
in addition to the required principal payments  we have made voluntary payments throughout the year resulting in a total decrease of million in the principal of our term loans during fiscal additionally  we had the benefit of the lower interest rates from our convertible notes for all of fiscal compared to approximately nine months in fiscal as prior to the issuance of the convertible notes we were paying a higher interest rate on the term loans  which had higher outstanding balances 
in fiscal  we will implement accounting guidance that requires us to allocate a portion of our convertible notes to equity based on the relative fair value of the embedded conversion feature in our convertible notes 
this component is amortized to interest expense 
as a result  we expect non cash interest to increase approximately million in fiscal from the adoption of this accounting guidance

table of contents other expense income  net 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount other expense income  net in fiscal  other expense income  net primarily includes other than temporary impairment charges of cost method investments of million and foreign currency transaction losses of million  offset by an increase of million in the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
included in the foreign currency transaction losses is a gain of million related to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment related to our manufacturing facility in shanghai  china due to its closure 
in fiscal  these balances were primarily related to a decrease in the cash surrender value of life insurance contracts related to our serp of million and foreign currency transaction losses of million 
the increase in foreign currency losses is due to the significant volatility of exchange rates during fiscal  primarily the euro 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate in the future  we may be exposed to continued financial risk

the effective tax rate for fiscal was significantly impacted by the acquired in process research and development charge related to the merger with cytyc and third wave acquisition  which is not tax deductible 
we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately of pre tax earnings in fiscal segment results of operations we report our business as four segments breast health  diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
breast health 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating loss income breast health revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the million decrease in product sales discussed above  partially offset by an increase of million in service revenues that 
table of contents is substantially related to additional service contracts for the increased number of selenia systems in our installed base 
this segment incurred an operating loss in fiscal compared to operating income in fiscal primarily due to a million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter related to our mammosite reporting unit in addition to the reduction of revenue discussed above and lower gross margins  partially offset by a reduction of operating expenses from our cost reduction initiatives implemented in the first half of fiscal our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower absorption of manufacturing costs due to lower volumes  an increase of million in amortization expense of intangible assets  and to a lesser extent  a slight deterioration of average selling prices driven by the current economic environment for capital purchases  and less expensive configurations of the units being sold 
in addition  included in cost of product sales was approximately million of costs related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in shanghai 
this segment incurred charges of million in fiscal related to sales of acquired mammosite inventory that was written up to fair value for purchase accounting purposes 
diagnostics 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating loss diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above 
the operating loss in this segment in fiscal included a million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter  intangible asset amortization of million and a full year of operating costs related to third wave compared to weeks in fiscal partially offsetting these additional charges in fiscal were reduced operating expenses resulting from our cost reduction initiatives implemented in the first half of fiscal the operating loss in fiscal included a million charge for in process research and development related to the third wave acquisition  an million charge for in process research and development related to the merger with cytyc  intangible asset amortization of million  and a million restructuring charge in the third quarter related to the resignation of our former executive chairman in may gross margin in fiscal was compared to in fiscal the reduction in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in amortization expense due to an increase of million and million in the amortization of cytyc and third wave related intangible assets  respectively 
in addition  gross margin in fiscal included the write off of intangible assets of million and million of charges for the write up to fair value of acquired inventory sold by third wave in fiscal gross margin in fiscal included charges of million and million  respectively  for the write up to fair value of acquired cytyc and third wave inventory sold during fiscal gyn surgical 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating loss 
table of contents gyn surgical revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the increase in product sales discussed above 
the operating loss in this segment in fiscal included a billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter and additional amortization expense of million 
partially offsetting these charges in fiscal was the increase in revenue discussed above as well as a decrease in operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in the first half of this year 
the operating loss in fiscal included a million charge for in process research and development related to the merger with cytyc  a million impairment charge for the helica thermal coagulator system intangibles and a million restructuring charge in the third quarter related to the resignation of our former executive chairman in may our gross margin in this business segment was in both fiscal and gross margin in fiscal and included amortization expense from intangible assets of million and million  respectively  and fiscal included a million charge for the write up to fair value of cytyc inventory that was sold during the first quarter of fiscal skeletal health 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income skeletal health revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the decline in product sales discussed above 
our gross margin in this business segment was compared to in fiscal the improvement was primarily due to reductions in material costs and in manufacturing spending 
operating income for this segment improved due to the improved gross margin and from cost reduction initiatives implemented in the first half of the operating income and gross margin in fiscal included a million charge associated with mri inventory and purchase obligations compared to million in fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics gyn surgical skeletal health in fiscal  our product sales increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to the revenues from the addition of the diagnostics segment  of approximately million  and the gyn surgical segment  of approximately million  that we acquired in connection with our merger with cytyc  and an increase in revenues from our breast health products of approximately million 
breast health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in worldwide digital mammography system sales  the addition of million of product sales 
table of contents of the mammosite radiation therapy system  a million increase in breast biopsy device sales and an increase of million in product sales of the mammopad breast cushion 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of million in digital array sales to an oem as we phase out of selling these arrays to third parties 
the mammosite system was acquired in connection with our merger with cytyc in october and the mammopad breast cushion was acquired in connection with our biolucent acquisition in september the increase in our digital mammography product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of selenia systems and related components sold  including our cad software 
in fiscal  we sold  digital mammography systems compared to  systems in fiscal this revenue was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices primarily attributable to increased competition  higher dealer sales  changes in product configuration and increased multi system sales 
we attribute the increase in digital mammography system sales primarily to the growing acceptance of our selenia mammography system and of digital mammography in general 
diagnostics product sales were million in fiscal  due to the inclusion of cytyc results for of the weeks in the current year as well as weeks of third wave revenues of approximately million 
cytyc diagnostic sales include our thinprep and rapid products 
gyn surgical product sales were million in fiscal  due to the inclusion of cytyc results for of the weeks in the current year 
these sales include our novasure system 
skeletal health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in mini c arm sales worldwide  partially offset by a million decrease in extremity mri sales and a million decrease in bone densitometry product sales 
the increase in mini c arm sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the average selling prices related to the commercialization of a new and enhanced product version 
the decrease in extremity mri sales was due to a decrease in the number of systems sold 
the decrease in bone densitometry sales was primarily due to a decrease in the number of used bone densitometry systems and upgrades sold and a decrease in the average selling prices of our bone densitometry systems in the united states  partially offset by an increase in the number of bone densitometry systems sold internationally 
we believe the decrease in our domestic osteoporosis assessment average selling prices reflected a decline in market conditions due in part to a reduction in reimbursement for osteoporosis assessment exams 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets 
the increase in the percentage of product sales generated in the united states in fiscal is primarily due to the additional product sales from cytyc  which had a higher percentage of its product sales from the united states than our historical businesses 
service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in service and other revenues of million in our breast health segment  primarily due to an increase in service contract revenues  and the inclusion of service and other revenues of million from the diagnostics segment as a result of the inclusion of cytyc results for of the weeks in fiscal we believe that the increase in our breast health service and other revenues reflected the growth in our installed base of systems and detectors

cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the addition of million of cost of product sales from the cytyc products included in our results since october  and  to a lesser extent  increased product sales of our historical products discussed above 
included in the additional cytyc cost of product sales is approximately million of additional costs related to sales of acquired cytyc inventory that was written up to fair value for purchase accounting purposes as of the date of acquisition 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue in fiscal was as compared to in the prior year 
these costs as a percentage of product sales decreased primarily due to the higher gross margins earned on cytyc product sales compared to our historical products  partially offset by the additional charges for the write up to fair value for the cytyc inventory sold as noted above 
also contributing to the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue was increased revenues and improved profitability associated with the shift in mammography product sales to our selenia full field digital mammography systems 
our higher selenia system sales resulted in an improved absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
partially offsetting the decreases in costs as a percentage of product sales were charges associated with a mri inventory impairment charge and related purchase obligations totaling million  and million related to sales of acquired third wave inventory that was written up to fair value in connection with purchase accounting in fiscal we identified certain costs recorded within cost of service and other revenues in our consolidated statement of operations during the first three quarters of fiscal that more appropriately should be classified as cost of product sales 
we determined that the reclassification was not material to our consolidated financial statements and corrected the classification in the fourth quarter of fiscal we also reclassified these costs related to prior periods to the current presentation  which resulted in an increase in cost of product sales and a corresponding decrease in cost of service and other revenues of million in the three months ended december   million in the three months ended march   and million in the three months ended june  cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets increased primarily due to million of amortization of intangible assets obtained as part of the merger with cytyc in the first quarter of fiscal the underlying intangible assets substantially relate to acquired developed technology and know how

the intangible assets acquired in the merger with cytyc are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years 
restructuring charges 
during fiscal  we recorded million in compensation charges  including million in stock based compensation  related to the resignation of our executive chairman  which was effective may  impairment of intangible assets 
subsequent to the merger with cytyc  we discontinued the development of cytyc s helica thermal coagulator system product  used for the treatment of endometriosis 
we will not realize any future cash flows from this product 
our intangible asset valuation for cytyc included approximately million related to customer relationships for helica 
as a result of the helica product discontinuation  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal acquired in process research and development expenses 
included in this charge in fiscal is million for in process research and development incurred in connection with our merger with cytyc as described in further detail above under fiscal acquisitions cytyc corporation 
also included is million for in process research and development incurred in connection with our acquisition of third wave as described in further detail above under fiscal acquisitions third wave technologies  inc interest income

provision for income taxes 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was of the pre tax loss 
for fiscal  our effective tax rate was affected by the in process research and development and intangible asset impairment charges we incurred in connection with our merger with cytyc and the in process research and development that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of third wave technologies 
absent the in process research and development and intangible asset impairment charges  our effective tax rate would have been approximately for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was of pre tax earnings 
this represented our normalized rate of approximately reduced by certain tax credits 
our net deferred tax liability increased approximately million in fiscal primarily due to the increase of intangible assets as a result of the merger with cytyc  for which the related amortization is not deductible for tax purposes 
segment results of operations as a result of our merger with cytyc we began reporting our business as four segments breast health  diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
fiscal was restated to conform to this presentation 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
breast health 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income 
table of contents breast health revenues for fiscal increased primarily due to the million increase in product sales discussed above and due to a million increase in service revenues that was primarily related to the increased number of service contracts for the increased number of selenia systems in our installed base 
operating income for this business segment increased primarily due to the increased revenues 
our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal our gross margins improved from the increase in product revenues of our more profitable selenia systems versus our analog mammography systems and  to a lesser extent  higher margins realized on our mammosite product  acquired as part of the merger with cytyc 
in addition  higher total revenues including higher selenia system sales have allowed for the greater absorption of manufacturing costs 
partially offsetting these improvements was a charge of million for the write up to fair value of mammosite rts inventory sold  primarily during the first quarter of fiscal operating expenses for this business segment increased in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of million of operating expenses from the mammosite business as well as from increased operating expenses in support of our growing selenia business 
also contributing to the increases during the year was an increase in stock based compensation of million  as well as a million restructuring charge in the third quarter related to the resignation of our executive chairman in may diagnostics 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating loss diagnostics revenues  which include our thinprep  rapid fetal fibronectin test and third wave products  totaled million in fiscal our gross margin in this business segment was  including charges of million and million  respectively  for the write up to fair value of the cytyc inventory sold during the first quarter and the third wave inventory sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal the operating loss also included an million charge for in process research and development as a result of the merger with cytyc in the first quarter  a million charge for in process research and development as a result of the third wave acquisition in the fourth quarter  stock based compensation of million and a million restructuring charge in the third quarter related to the resignation of our executive chairman in may gyn surgical 
years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating loss gyn surgical revenues  which include our novasure products and our adiana system under development in fiscal  totaled million in fiscal in the second and third quarters  we believe that sales of the novasure system were adversely affected by a modest softening in sales to the hospital based market  as well as lower than expected customer inventory utilization 
our sales to both the hospital market and office based market generally have been based upon current order bookings for immediate shipment with little or no backlog 
over the last three quarters  we refocused our sales efforts and programs to increasing longer term customer 
table of contents commitments 
however  while we could not assure that we would be successful  our goal was to have an increase in novasure system backlog  followed by an increase in sequential growth of revenue during fiscal with sales to the physician office based market playing a role in that increase 
our gross margin in this business segment was during this period and includes a charge of million for the write up to fair value of the cytyc inventory sold during the first fiscal quarter of the operating loss for fiscal also includes a million charge for in process research and development as a result of the merger with cytyc and a million impairment charge of the helica thermal coagulator system intangibles

years ended september  september  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount total revenues operating income skeletal health revenues increased in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to the million increase in product sales discussed above 
our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal compared to in fiscal operating income and gross margin for the skeletal health segment increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to the increased revenues and due to improved absorption as a result of manufacturing additional products in the facility where the skeletal health products are produced  partially offset by charges associated with mri inventory and purchase obligations recorded in fiscal totaling million compared to million in fiscal skeletal health costs and expenses included stock compensation of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had million of working capital  and our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by million during fiscal  primarily from cash generated from our operations 
this cash source was partially offset by our financing activities relating to our repayment of amounts outstanding under our credit agreement and certain other notes payable and to a lesser extent cash used in our investing activities primarily for purchases of property and equipment and placement of equipment under customer usage agreements 
our operating activities generated million of cash  which included a net loss of billion reduced primarily by non cash charges for goodwill and intangible asset impairments of billion  depreciation and amortization expense of million  stock based compensation expense of million and non cash interest expense of million from the amortization of debt issuance costs 
cash provided by operations due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts receivable of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million and a decrease in prepaid income taxes of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the decline in sales volume in the current quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as improved collections 
the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of service contracts as our installed base of our breast health products continues to grow 
the decrease in prepaid income taxes was due to the utilization of amounts to offset current taxable income 
cash provided by operations was offset by an increase in inventories of million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of million and million  respectively 
the increase in inventories was primarily related to the increase in components on hand as a result 
table of contents of the decline in sales volume 
the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments and our overall efforts to reduce operating expenses 
the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to lower compensation and bonuses as a result of a lower headcount and operating results below the operating plan  and overall lower operating expenses excluding amortization of intangible assets due to our cost reduction initiatives 
during fiscal  we used million of cash in investing activities 
this use of cash was primarily attributable to million for purchases of property and equipment  which consisted primarily of manufacturing  demonstration and test equipment and computer software and hardware 
we also invested million in equipment under customer usage agreements and purchased certain intellectual property totaling million 
in addition  we purchased of million of life insurance contracts to fund future payments under our serp 
during fiscal  we utilized million of cash in financing activities  substantially for repayments of the term loans under our credit agreement of million and the payment of million of notes payable  primarily our aeg loans 
offsetting these payments was proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of common shares under the employee stock purchase plan

as of the closing of the merger with cytyc we borrowed billion under the credit facilities  all of which had variable interest rates 
we applied the net proceeds from our convertible note offering described below to repay amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
during the year ended september   we also made voluntary prepayments of principal to fully repay the terms loans under the credit agreement 
on july   in connection with our acquisition of third wave  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with certain of the lenders the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement amended and restated our existing credit agreement with goldman sachs credit partners lp and the lenders named therein  dated as of october  in order to consummate the purchase of all issued and outstanding stock of third wave  we borrowed million of term loans under the credit facilities on july  of which million was designated term loan a and million designated term loan b 
in addition  we have a million revolving credit facility under the amended credit agreement the revolving facility 
our obligations under the 
table of contents amended credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of september   we had an aggregate of million of principal outstanding under the amended credit agreement  consisting of million under term loan a and million under term loan b 
subsequent to september   we paid an additional million of principal of which million was a voluntary payment 
this voluntary payment of million has been reclassified to current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet at september  as of that date we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving facility  and therefore  had full availability 
the final maturity dates for the credit facility are september  for the term loan a and revolving facility and march  for the term loan b 
all amounts outstanding under the amended credit agreement bear interest  at hologic s option  as follows with respect to loans made under the revolving facility and the term loan a facility i at the base rate plus per annum  which was reduced from in may  or ii at the reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus per annum  which was reduced from in may  and with respect to loans made under the term loan b facility i at the base rate plus per annum  or ii at the reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus per annum

the notes bear interest at a rate of per year on the principal amount  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on june and december of each year  beginning june   and ending on december  and will accrete principal from december  at a rate that provides holders with an aggregate annual yield to maturity of per year 
beginning with the six month interest period commencing december   we will pay contingent interest during any six month interest period to the holders of notes if the trading price  as defined  of the notes for each of the five trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds of the accreted principal amount

in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock in satisfaction of our obligation upon conversion of the notes  we may elect to deliver cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation solely in cash  we will deliver cash in an amount as provided in the indenture for the notes 
if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  we will deliver up to a specified dollar amount of cash per  original principal amount of notes  and will settle the remainder of our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock  in each case based on the daily conversion value calculated as provided in the indenture for the notes 
in addition  at any time on or prior to the th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the notes  we may make an irrevocable election to settle conversions of the notes either solely in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock with a specified cash amount at least equal to the accreted principal amount of the notes 
this net share settlement election is in our sole discretion and does not require the consent of holders of the notes 
it is our current intent and policy to settle any conversion of the notes as if we had elected to make the net share settlement election 
the notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and prior to all future subordinated debt 
the notes are effectively subordinated to any future secured indebtedness to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness  and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities including trade payables of our subsidiaries 
contingent earn out payments 
as a result of the merger with cytyc  we assumed the obligation to the former adiana stockholders to make contingent earn out payments tied to the achievement of milestones 
the milestone payments include potential contingent payments of up to million based on worldwide sales of the adiana system in the first year following fda approval and on annual incremental sales growth thereafter through december  we received fda approval of the adiana system on july   and the company began accruing contingent consideration in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the defined percentage of worldwide sales of the product 
the total accrued contingent consideration net at september  is million 
these amounts are being recorded as additional purchase price  and under the terms of the agreement the first payment is not due to the adiana shareholders until october the agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of qualifying legal expenses in defense of the adiana intellectual property  and we have the right to offset contingent consideration payments to the adiana shareholders with these qualifying legal costs 
legal costs have not been material to date 
since it is not possible to estimate the amount  and the timing of such amounts  of contingent consideration we will pay in the future as it is based on future revenues  the maximum amount or any other amount of contingent consideration payments has not been included in the contractual obligations table below

this represents certain non cancelable supply contracts 
for reasons of quality assurance  sole source availability or cost effectiveness  certain key components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier 
to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability  long term supply contracts have been executed with these suppliers 
in certain of these contracts  a minimum purchase commitment has been established 
pension obligations do not include our obligation under the supplemental executive retirement plan  which is recorded as a current liability of million 
these benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment 
this represents a private equity investment commitment with a limited liability partnership  which could be paid over the succeeding two years 
the above table does not reflect our long term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions recorded under fin codified primarily in asc  income taxes totaling million 
due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties  we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non current liabilities 
see note in our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  certain of our cost method equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies  we have not included these future potential payments in the table above 
we expect to continue to review and evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  and strategic alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business 
subject to the risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this report and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward looking statements at the outset of this report  we believe that cash flow from operations and cash available from our amended credit agreement will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected operations over the next twelve months 
our longer term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our amended credit agreement 
we 
table of contents may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other investments  or to repay our convertible notes 
the holders of the convertible notes may require us to repurchase the notes on december of  and on each of december    and at a repurchase price equal to of their accreted principal amount 
these capital requirements could be substantial 
our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above referenced risk factors as elsewhere in this report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long term liquidity 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims 
in connection with these legal proceedings and claims  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with asc  contingencies formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  valuations and purchase price allocations related to business combinations  expected future cash flows including growth rates  discount rates  terminal values and other assumptions and estimates used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  warranty reserves  certain accrued expenses  restructuring and other related charges  stock based compensation  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures on products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future 
table of contents market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are primarily based on our estimates of forecasted net sales and service usage levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future 
we record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory as cost of sales 
accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  including a dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  and evaluation of the customer s current financial situation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  for example as a result of the recent financial and economic turmoil or otherwise  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
valuation of business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
we expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole 

table of contents we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects we acquired in connection with our fiscal acquisitions  we used risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows  ranging from to 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
we have also used the income approach  as described above  to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology  customer relationships and trade names 
developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know how 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
tradenames represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter 
in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct 
table of contents this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as the date of the impairment test on our weighted average cost of capital 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
during the first quarter of fiscal  based upon a combination of factors  including the deteriorating macro economic environment  declines in the stock market and the decline of our market capitalization significantly below the book value of our net assets  we concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of december  as a result  we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of december  step of the impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of certain reporting units  acquired in connection with the cytyc acquisition  exceeded the estimated fair value of those reporting units 
as a result  we were required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment charges for each of the applicable reporting units 
the step analysis required us to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation for each of these reporting units to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the recorded amount of goodwill by reporting unit 
due to the complexities and time involved in preparing the step analysis  we had not commenced the step analysis as of february   the date we filed our form q for the quarter ended december  as a result of the fact that we had not commenced the step analysis and the complexity of the analysis required to complete the step analysis  we were unable to determine that an impairment loss  in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  was both probable and reasonably estimable at december  we completed the step analysis during our second quarter of fiscal  which resulted in an aggregate goodwill impairment charge of billion 
this impairment charge is comprised of billion for gyn surgical  million for diagnostics  and million for breast health related to our mammosite reporting unit acquired from cytyc 
we believe that our procedures and related assumptions for estimating the reporting units fair value are reasonable and consistent with the market conditions that existed at the time of the impairment test 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair values of each reporting unit for which we recorded goodwill impairment charges in the second quarter of fiscal been lower by as of december   we would have recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
based on the company s estimates as of december   the impact of reducing our fair value estimates for our other reporting units  for which we did not record any goodwill impairment charges  by would have had no impact on the our goodwill assessment for those reporting units 
we conducted our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to complete the annual impairment test  we updated our interim impairment test results and performed detailed analyses estimating the fair value of most of our reporting units utilizing our fiscal forecast with updated long term growth assumptions 
for one reporting unit  we utilized the results of our interim impairment test 
pursuant to asc formerly paragraph of sfas  we concluded that it met the required criteria to use the estimated fair value determined from its interim impairment analysis for this reporting unit because the composition of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit had not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination  the most recent fair value determination resulted in a fair value that exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by a substantial margin  and management concluded  based on an analysis of current events that had occurred and circumstances that had changed since the most recent fair value determination  that it is remote that the current fair value of the reporting unit would not exceed their carrying amounts 
as a result of completing step  all of our reporting units  except one  had a fair value exceeding their carrying value  and as such step of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units 
for the reporting unit that failed step  we completed step and determined that an impairment charge was not required 
table of contents due to the fair value of the implied goodwill exceeding the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair value of this reporting unit at june  been lower by  the company still would not have recorded any impairment charge 
if the fair value of our other reporting units had been lower by  two reporting units would have failed step requiring a step analysis 
these reporting units  one in the diagnostics reportable segment and one in the skeletal health reportable segment  had fair values at this date that exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively  and goodwill of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of these reporting units is determined by use of a discounted cash flow analysis dcf under the income approach 
the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the discount rates ie  weighted average cost of capital  wacc  terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
if the current worldwide financial markets and economic environment were to deteriorate  this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return 
in the dcf as the wacc increases  the fair value decreases 
the other significant factor in the dcf is our projected financial information ie  amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates and if our assumptions were to be adversely impacted  this could result in a reduction of the fair values of these reporting units 
for our other reporting units with goodwill aggregating billion  we believe that these reporting units are not at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no rights of return exist and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  our product arrangements are multiple element arrangements  including services such as installation and training 
we account for these arrangements in accordance with asc  multiple element arrangements formerly emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we have concluded that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered product has value to our customers on a stand alone basis and we have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of such services and undelivered products 
accordingly  service revenue representing the fair value of services not yet performed at the time of product shipment is deferred and recognized as such services are performed 
the fair value of the undelivered products is also deferred at the time of product shipment and recognized when these products are delivered 
the residual revenue under the product arrangement will be recognized as product revenue upon shipment 
there are no customer rights of return in our sales agreements 
we recognize product revenue upon the completion of installation for products whose installation is essential to its functionality  primarily related to our digital imaging systems 
a provision is made at that time for estimated warranty costs to be incurred 
service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty  installation and training revenues and shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
other service revenues are recorded when the services are delivered 
although certain of our products contain operating and application software  we have determined that except for our cad computer aided detection products obtained with the acquisition of r technology  inc and the newly released dimensions d d full field digital mammography product dimensions  the software element is incidental in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules 

table of contents we have determined that the provisions of asc  software revenue recognition formerly aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition apply to revenue transactions for our cad systems and the dimensions product 
asc generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
revenue recognized from multi element arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement using the residual method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
our determination of fair value of the undelivered elements in multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
we recognize revenue on cad systems and dimensions product sales upon completion of installation  at which time the only remaining undelivered element is post contract support pcs 
upon its release  we completed an evaluation of the software component of our dimensions product in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules 
we noted the following in our evaluation of the software component of our new dimensions product dimensions is offered in different configurations offering different levels of functionality d vs 
d 
customers who purchase the d configuration will be to able to upgrade the product to a d version and such upgrade will solely represent a software upgrade that will be marketed and sold separately 
this differentiation from our existing d digital mammography product is expected to be highlighted in our marketing literature 
as part of the initial warranty of the dimensions product  customers will receive not only bug fixes related to the software but will also receive any updates and enhancements to the software that are released 
therefore  we concluded that this represents pcs as defined in asc as a result  we have determined that the dimensions product contains software that is more than incidental to the product as a whole and thus  will be accounted for under asc therefore  we recognize revenue upon installation and acceptance  if required  and defer revenue based on the vsoe of fair value of the initial bundled pcs 
we have determined that vsoe of fair value of the initial bundled pcs exists based on the establishment of the price for which this element will be sold separately by management having the relevant authority and that it is probable that this price will not change prior to when this service is sold separately 
we have specified the renewal rates at which service can be purchased separately upon expiration of the initial pcs period and those rates have been consistent 
for multi element arrangements where vsoe of fair value of pcs has been established  we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
amounts attributable to post contract support are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the contractual term of the support 
under customer usage agreements  we install certain equipment for example  a thinprep processor or a thinprep imaging system at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable supplies at a stated price generally including a usage fee for the equipment over a defined contract term  which is typically between three and five years 
revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as disposable supplies are delivered 
we also rent certain equipment to customers 
revenues from rental agreements are recorded over the terms of the rental agreements 
product warranties products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve at the time of revenue recognition for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased or decreased warranty claim activity or increased or decreased costs associated with 
table of contents servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase or decrease  respectively  resulting in decreased or increased gross profit 
our warranty accrual was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the warranty accrual in both fiscal and fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in warranty claim activity primarily related to our digital mammography systems 
stock based compensation the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment codified in asc  stock compensation in the first quarter of fiscal required that stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income  rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we determined the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r  we elected to use a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options including the advice of an outside valuation advisor and the advisor s model 
the model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
we currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility  which is weighted based on a number of factors 
expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  the company has determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and has applied forfeiture rates ranging from to as of september  depending on the specific employee group 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of september   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock option awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
as of september   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock units that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between financial reporting and taxes bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 

table of contents we recognized net deferred tax liabilities of million at september  and million at september  the liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and the original issuance discount on our convertible notes 
the tax assets relate primarily net operating loss carryforwards  accruals and reserves  stock based compensation and research credits 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
on september   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
codified primarily in asc  income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized 
as a result of our adoption of fin no 
 we recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million as a decrease to opening retained earnings 
we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  of approximately million as of september  and million as of september  at september   million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in a reduction of the company s effective tax rate 
in the next twelve months it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by million due to expiration of statute of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities  which will reduce the company s effective tax rate 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb ratified asc update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu  amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of fasb accounting standards codification  or asc  subtopic previously included within eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf 
this consensus provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue recognition guidance 
first  this guidance deletes the requirement to have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for undelivered elements in an arrangement and will result in more deliverables being treated as separate units of accounting 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
these changes may result in entities recognizing more revenue up front  and entities will no longer be able to apply the residual method and defer the fair value of undelivered elements 
upon adoption of these new rules  each separate unit of accounting must have a selling price  which can be based on management s estimate when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item  and the arrangement consideration is allocated based on the elements relative 
table of contents selling price 
this accounting guidance is effective no later than fiscal years beginning on or after june  but may be early adopted as of the first quarter of an entity s fiscal year 
entities may elect to adopt this accounting guidance either through prospective application to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption or through a retrospective application to all revenue arrangements for all periods presented in the financial statements

 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  which amends the existing accounting guidance for how entities account for arrangements that include both hardware and software  which typically resulted in the sale of hardware being accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules 
this accounting guidance changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software elements and non software elements 
the tangible element of the product is always outside of the scope of the software revenue recognition rules  and the software elements of tangible products when the software element and non software elements function together to deliver the product s essential functionality are outside of the scope of the software rules 
as a result  both the hardware and qualifying related software elements are excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance and accounted for under the revised multiple element revenue recognition guidance 
this accounting guidance is effective for all fiscal years beginning on or after june  with early adoption permitted 
entities must adopt asu and asu in the same manner and at the same time 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this revised accounting guidance  which we can adopt as early as the first quarter of fiscal in april  the fasb issued fasb staff positions fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairment fsp codified within asc  investments debt and equity securities 
fsp amends the requirements for the recognition and measurement of other than temporary impairments for debt securities by modifying the pre existing intent and ability indicator 
under this fsp  an other than temporary impairment is triggered when there is an intent to sell the security  it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery  or the security is not expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
additionally  this fsp changes the presentation of an other than temporary impairment in the income statement for those impairments involving credit losses 
the credit loss component will be recognized in earnings and the remainder of the impairment will be recorded in other comprehensive income 
fsp was effective for us beginning with the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this fsp did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asc  business combinations formerly sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting which sfas called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
asc requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
asc replaces sfas s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the statement retains the guidance in sfas for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
asc will now require acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally to affect income tax expense 
asc applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   which is our fiscal year 
early adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of asc will have on our consolidated financial statements

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas codified within asc  consolidation 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
to establish accounting and reporting standards for the 
table of contents noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   which is our fiscal year 
early adoption is prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued fasb fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets codified within asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized intangible asset under asc the objective of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under asc and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under asc the fsp is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   which will be the beginning of fiscal for us

apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement codified within asc  debt 
this fsp applies to convertible debt instruments that  by their stated terms  may be settled in cash or other assets upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  unless the embedded conversion option is required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under asc  derivatives and hedging formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments within the scope of this fsp must be separately accounted for in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the excess of the principal amount of the debt over the amount ultimately allocated to the liability component is required to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
as a result  we will adopt this standard at the beginning of fiscal this fsp must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
the retrospective adoption of this fsp will increase our historical reported interest expense from december  issuance date of the convertible notes see note forward 
the adoption of fsp apb will have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows 
however  upon adoption in fiscal  we will restate prior periods by reclassifying approximately  of our convertible notes to additional paid in capital  resulting in a debt discount 
it is estimated that our non cash interest expense will increase by approximately million and for the years ended september  and september   respectively  resulting in a restated diluted net loss per share of approximately and for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
we expect to record approximately an additional million of non cash interest expense in fiscal in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf codified within asc 
this accounting guidance clarifies the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  which would qualify as a scope exception under asc  and it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted 
we have concluded that upon the adoption of this standard  the embedded derivative 
table of contents option in our convertible notes see note will continue to be considered indexed to our own stock 
as a result  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles codified within asc  generally accepted accounting principles  which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification as the single source of authoritative us gaap 
the codification will supersede all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
as a result  upon adoption  all references to accounting literature in our sec filings will conform to the appropriate reference within the codification 
the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
asc  financial instruments formerly sfas no 
 disclosure of fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and debt obligations 
except for our outstanding convertible note  the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
as of september  we have billion of convertible notes outstanding 
the fair value of our convertible notes was approximately billion as of september  based on the trading price as of that date 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we incur interest expense on borrowings outstanding under our amended credit agreement and to a much lesser extent the debt assumed in our acquisition of aeg  which as of september  is million 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  with respect to the borrowings under the term loan a of either the base rate the greater of the prime rate as quoted in the wall street journal and the federal funds effective rate plus  which was reduced from in may or the eurodollar rate  plus  which was reduced from in may  and with respect to the term loan b of either the base rate the greater of the prime rate as quoted in the wall street journal and the federal funds effective rate plus or the eurodollar rate  plus 
as of september   there was approximately million outstanding under the amended credit agreement  including million under the term loan a facility which matures on september  and million under the term loan b facility which matures on march  subsequent to september   we paid an additional million of principal resulting in an outstanding balance of million at the time of filing this form k 
these debt obligations are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is  therefore  subject to changes in market interest rates 
a adverse movement increase in libor would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
the return from cash and cash equivalents will vary as short term interest rates change 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
interest income on our cash and cash equivalents is recorded as a component of other expense income  net in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 

table of contents we maintain sales and service offices outside the united states  have manufacturing facilities in germany and costa rica and conduct business worldwide 
the expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies  except at our costa rica subsidiary  where the majority of the business is conducted in us dollars 
our foreign sales are denominated in local currencies  the euro or us dollars 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our sales  cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in the euro are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the euro 
our expenses denominated in euros are positively affected when the united states dollar strengthens against the euro and adversely affected when the united states dollar weakens 
however  we believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not significant 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currencies that we transact in would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we incurred foreign exchange losses of million  million and million  respectively
