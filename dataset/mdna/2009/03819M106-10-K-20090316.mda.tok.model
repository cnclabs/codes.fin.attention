critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its assumptions on historical experiences and on various other inputs and estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in addition  management considers the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
significant estimates include revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  estimate to forecast loss on contracts under the completed contract method of accounting  the valuation of inventory  estimates of long lived asset value  and estimate to forecast expected forfeiture rate on stock based compensation and stock based compensation expense 
revenue recognition revenue has been derived from ongoing contract work for systems development  effects testing and the design and development of demonstration systems and sub systems for our government and commercial customers 
this work is expected to be generally performed under cost plus contracts with government customers 
revenue under long term government contracts is generally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
revenue  billable monthly  under cost plus fixed fee contracts is recorded as costs are incurred and includes estimated earned fees in the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs 
costs include direct labor  direct materials  subcontractor costs and overhead 
general and administrative expenses allowable under the terms of the contracts are allocated per contract depending on its direct labor and material proportion to total direct labor and material of all contracts 
as contracts can extend over one or more accounting periods  revisions in earnings estimated during the course of work are reflected during the accounting period in which the facts become known 
when the current contract estimate indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period in which the facts become known 
management evaluates many variables and makes various assumptions related to the estimation of total cost of completion of long term contracts 
management reviews the progress and performance of all contracts monthly 
the asset caption accounts receivable includes costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  which represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
such revenue is billable under the terms of the contracts at the end of the year  yet was not invoiced until the following year and is generally expected to be collected within one year 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenue recognized 
revenue for other products and services is recognized when such products and services are delivered or performed and  in connection with certain sales to certain customers  when the products and services are accepted  which is normally negotiated as part of the initial contract 
revenue from commercial  non governmental  customers has historically been based on fixed price contracts where the sale is recognized upon acceptance of the product or performance of the service and when payment is probable under the completed contract method of accounting 
contract costs are accumulated in the same manner as inventory costs and are charged to operations as the related revenue from contract is recognized 
when the current contract estimate indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period in which the facts become known 
inventories inventories include material  direct labor and related manufacturing overhead and are stated at the lower of cost determined on a weighted average basis or market 
due to the nature of our inventory  we analyze inventory on an item by item basis compared to future usage and sales for obsolescence quarterly 
stock based compensation sfas no 
r  share based payment  establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee  director and non employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
we adopted the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas r 
under this method  sfas r is applied to stock based compensation made after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered  such as unvested stock options  that were outstanding as of the date of adoption will be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption will be based on the grant date fair value for those awards 
the fair value of each option is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
we estimate expected stock price volatility based on the mean of the historical volatility of applied energetics  an industry index and a representative peer group 
we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates 
sfas r requires the estimation of forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and that this estimate of forfeitures be adjusted over the requisite service period should actual forfeitures differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative adjustment  which is recognized in the period of change and which impacts the amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
we estimate expected life by analyzing the historical option exercise behavior of employees considering the effect of strike and market price on employee decision making and pertinent vesting schedules 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield for comparable periods 
results of operations our consolidated financial information for the years ending december    and is as follows revenue cost of revenue general and administrative selling and marketing research and development impairment of assets other expense income interest expense interest income other income loss before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss revenue revenue increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to  which was primarily attributable to increased revenues from our new us marine corps contract received in june for the cied product line  and completed projects within our commercial hv product line 
the increased revenue in the cied product line was approximately million and the increase in the hv product line was million  offset by a reduction in lge revenue of approximately million 
the million increase in revenue from to was primarily due to an increase in revenue from our lge project of million  which was partially offset by a decrease of million from our cied projects and a decrease in our non governmental projects of  cost of revenue cost of revenue for increased approximately million compared to the increase in cost of revenue is consistent with the increase in revenues offset by loss accruals of million and a lower of cost or market reserve of million taken in by product line  there was an increase of million for cied  an increase of million for high voltage and a decrease of million for lge 
cost of revenue includes manufacturing labor  benefits and overhead  and an allocation of allowable general and administration and research and development costs in accordance with the terms of our government contracts 
cost of revenue also increased from to  consistent with our increased revenue  by million 
the negative gross margin in was primarily due to million estimated loss accruals attributed to the contracted development of high voltage technologies and the increase in lower cost or market reserve of million 
general and administrative g a expenses decreased approximately million between and the decrease primarily consisted of a million increase in applied labor  overhead and material handling costs allocated to cost of revenue and decreases of  in non cash share based expenses   in professional fees   in building related expenses largely due to the purchase of our principal tucson facility in february and to  in depreciation and amortization expenses 
in addition  there were decreases on disposal of assets of  primarily from the exit from our leased facilities at the stennis space center  mississippi in september the decrease was partially offset by increases of  in salaries and accrued compensation  and  in travel and recruiting expenses for the same period 
general and administrative expense increased from to by approximately  this increase consists of an increase in stock based compensation for stock based awards granted to directors and employees in the amount of million  an increase in salaries and accrued compensation in the amount of  and a decrease of million of applied overhead 
offsetting these increases were reductions in temporary help and consultants of  travel related expenses of  professional fees of  supplies of  and fringe and benefits costs of  at december   there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested restricted stock awards  net of estimated forfeitures and approximately million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options  net of estimated forfeitures 
these costs are expected to be recognized on a weighted average basis over periods of approximately four years for restricted stock awards and two years for unvested stock options 
at december   there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested restricted stock awards  net of estimated forfeitures and approximately million of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options  net of estimated forfeitures 
these costs are expected to be recognized on a weighted average basis over periods of approximately two years for restricted stock awards and one year for unvested stock options 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decreased approximately  between and  reflecting reduced payroll costs and professional fees 
selling and marketing expenses were approximately  for  a decrease of approximately  from  in  reflecting reduced salaries and travel costs 
research and development research and development expenses increased approximately  from to  with increases in research and development expenses related to laser technologies of  to lge of  and to hv of  these increases were offset by the decrease in research and development expenses related to cied products of  and to patents expense of  research and development expenses decreased approximately million during as compared to primarily due the redeployment of our technical staff to our funded projects in progress 
during  we started new research and development initiative and we continued work on our on going research projects to expedite the advancement of our lge  lipc and cied technologies 
these strategic decisions are designed to advance and strengthen our intellectual property rights and advance technology development at a rate that is less dependent on contract funding 
as revenues declined in  the burden of increased r d was increasingly borne by company internal funds 
also impacting the rise was the approximately million increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses allocated to research and development 
the costs to complete and the estimated dates upon which our efforts will result in commercially viable products are uncertain 
many aspects of our technologies are highly sensitive to ongoing military operations and are largely classified under specific dod guidelines and  consequently  cannot be disclosed publicly 
our short term research and development goals are to develop efficient and compact laser sources  novel high voltage electrical sources  efficient optical systems to extend the range of our lge system and engineer the lge hardware to smaller and more rugged technologies 
impairment of intangible assets we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter 
in  due to a significant reduction in sales volume and negative cash flows  we revised the five year earnings forecast and projected cash flows for north star 
the projected cash flows were considered in determining the fair value of goodwill and unamortized intangible assets recorded at the acquisition and also in subsequent periods to assess for potential impairment 
due to the decline in projected cash flows in  the company performed assessments of the carrying value of north star s goodwill and tradename indefinite lived intangible assets 
this assessment consisted of estimating the asset s fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset 
we estimated the goodwill asset s fair value through the use of an average of the capitalization of gross revenues and goodwill revenue methods to value the revenue generated because the analyses are made independent of direct reference to the reporting unit s actual performance 
the north star tradename intangible asset s fair value was estimated through an analysis of the projected cash flow 
based on these analyses  we determined that the fair values of our goodwill and tradename intangible assets were below their carrying value and in the fourth quarter of recorded impairment charges of approximately million for goodwill and  for the north star tradename 
interest income and interest expense net interest income for the was lower by approximately  from primarily due to the lower balance of invested funds and lower interest rates on our investments in net interest income for was higher by approximately  versus primarily because the funds provided from the august financing were invested in income producing investments for all of as compared to less than two months of net loss as a result of the foregoing  our operations in resulted in a net loss of approximately million  a reduction of approximately million compared to the million loss for this decrease in loss incorporates an increase in revenues of million  decreases in g a of million and sales and marketing of  offset by an increase in costs of revenue of million  a decrease in net interest income of  and an increase in r d of  our operations for the year ended december  resulted in a net loss of approximately million  an improvement of approximately million when compared to this improvement reflects reduction in research and development expenses of approximately million  a reduction of million from the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recognized in and an increase of our net interest income of  offset by a decrease in our gross margin of  and an increase of general and administrative expenses of inflation and seasonality we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on the operations or financial condition of our business  nor do we believe that we are subject to significant seasonal swings in our business 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
in  we used approximately million of cash in operating activities 
this amount is comprised primarily of our net loss of approximately million and decreases in inventories of million 
offsetting these amounts were non cash stock option compensation expense of approximately million  a decrease in accrued expenses  deposits and deferred rent of million 
also in  investment activities provided approximately million consisting of the sale of available for sale securities of million and partially offset by purchases of approximately million of equipment 
during  financing activities used approximately  primarily representing preferred stock dividends 
we do not anticipate significant capital expenditures for we anticipate that short term and long term funding needs will be provided from the cash flow from servicing our government contracts 
we believe that we have sufficient working capital to fulfill existing contracts and expected contracts in and into the government contracts  that presently represent a major portion of our current activity  are on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
this means all work performed is done at our government approved rates  which include general and administrative costs  overhead  labor and materials  fees and profit 
these costs are accrued as incurred and billed monthly 
we previously held investments in auction rate securities ars in the form of asset backed securities 
in accordance with fas  we recorded temporary impairment charges within other comprehensive loss during the first quarter of due to temporary market failures and illiquidity first experienced during the first quarter of due to auction failures 
during the fourth quarter of all of the ars securities previously held by the company were sold at par and all accumulated interest was paid in connection with the final settlement 
the company does not own any ars securities as of december  the company invested of the proceeds in government backed money market securities and equivalents 
the following reflects quarterly activity for ars securities asset backed securities fair value december  unrealized losses st quarter sales rd quarter unrealized loss adjustment rd quarter sales th quarter unrealized loss adjustment th quarter fair value december  backlog of orders at december  and and february   respectively  we had a backlog that is  work load remaining on signed contracts of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to be completed within the next twelve months following those dates 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payment by period less than more than total year to years to years years capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total not included in the above table are the dividends on our series a preferred stock that are approximately  each year approximately  each quarter  assuming no conversion to common stock 
capital leases we rent office equipment under capital lease agreements with approximately in monthly payments 
operating leases we generally operate in leased premises under operating leases that have options permitting renewals for additional periods 
in addition to minimum fixed rentals  the leases typically contain scheduled escalation clauses resulting in a deferred rent accrual at december  of approximately  we account for the escalation provision by straight line inclusion in the rent expense 
total rent expense on premises amounted to approximately   and  for  and  respectively 
in february  we purchased our principal office  manufacturing  storage  and primary research and development facility in tucson  arizona for approximately million 
preferred stock the series a preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share 
the series a preferred stock bears dividends at the rate of of the liquidation preference per share per annum  which accrues from the date of issuance  and is payable quarterly  when declared 
dividends are payable in i cash  ii shares of our common stock valued for such purpose at of the weighted average of the last sales prices of our common stock for each of the trading days in the ten trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the applicable dividend payment date  provided that the issuance and or resale of all such shares of our common stock are then covered by an effective registration statement or iii any combination of the foregoing 
during this fiscal year   shares of series a preferred stock were converted to common stock at a range of contractual and negotiated conversion rates  thus reducing the quarterly dividend 
as of december   there were  shares of series a preferred stock outstanding 
during the fourth quarter of  the company exchanged  shares of series a preferred stock for  shares of common stock 
the company accounted for the exchange pursuant to eitf topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock  eitf topic d  and sfas no 
 induced conversions of convertible debt  sfas no 

the exchanges were made at terms other than the original conversion terms  therefore the company recorded a charge stock dividend to accumulated deficit of approximately million  which equaled the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
the par value of the series a preferred stock exchanged and the aforementioned million on the induced conversion was reclassified to paid in capital at the time of conversion

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to a variety of risks  such as the ability to collect our accounts receivable and the recoverability of the carrying values of our long term assets 
we do not presently enter into any transactions involving derivative financial instruments for risk management or other purposes 
our available cash balances are invested in money market funds invested primarily in government securities with generally immediate liquidity 
these short term cash like investments are subject to general interest rate and general market risks 
however  lack of timely access to these funds or loss of any portion of principal could be catastrophic to the ongoing funding and health of our business 
substantially all of our cash flows are derived from our operations within the united states and today we are not subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates
