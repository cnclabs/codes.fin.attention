item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a provider of energy efficiency and renewable energy design build solutions 
we perform energy efficiency engineering and consulting as well as the development and implementation of energy efficient lighting  mechanical  electrical  water  building envelope weatherization  and renewable energy solutions 
currently  we primarily serve the commercial and industrial and the public sector markets 
our commercial and industrial clients include many fortune companies for which we directly provide our energy efficiency solutions and technology 
we also serve the public sector  including government and educational institutions  through our relationships with large energy service companies esco 
escos are awarded project contracts with the public sector  and we serve as their energy efficiency service experts to develop  engineer and implement solutions outside of the scope of their offerings 
in  our revenue increased by to million as compared to million in our net loss in narrowed to million as compared to million in we have invested significant amounts of capital and resources in building the infrastructure of our energy efficiency services business including through the aem acquisition in june and developing and enhancing the proprietary technology of our energy technology business 
we believe that our energy efficiency services business forms a strong platform for continued growth 
we operate under three reporting segments energy efficiency services  energy technology and financial services 
energy efficiency services 
our energy efficiency services segment represented approximately of our revenue during the our energy efficiency services segment includes engineering and consulting we apply our engineering expertise to analyze each client s energy consumption and operational needs and develop customized energy 
table of contents efficiency solutions 
our energy engineering and consulting services include project development services  energy management planning  energy bill analysis  building energy audits and e commissioning 
we also provide design review and analysis of new construction projects to maximize energy efficiency and sustainability  project management of energy related construction  and processing and procurement of incentive and rebate applications 
implementation we provide a range of energy efficiency and conservation services  including energy efficient lighting upgrade services  mechanical and electrical conservation services  water conservation  services building envelope weatherization services and renewable energy solutions 
our objective is to improve the quality of our clients physical space  maximize their operational savings  capitalize on rebates available to them and reduce their maintenance costs 
we take into consideration factors such as infrastructure requirements  best available technologies  building environmental conditions  hours of operation  energy costs  available utility rebates and tax incentives  and installation  operation and maintenance costs of various efficiency alternatives 
energy technology 
our energy technology segment  which represented approximately of our revenue  offers our patented line of heating  ventilation and air conditioning and lighting controllers under the emac and umac brand names 
the emac technology provides remote monitoring  management and control of commercial rooftop hvac units 
our umac technology is a version of the emac that remotely controls the operation of a facility s lights via wireless communications 
financial services 
our financial services segment began operations in late to enable our commercial and industrial clients to pay for our energy efficiency solutions over time 
we record the extended payment receivables from our clients as long term receivables and consolidate them within a subsidiary for purposes of optimal receivables management and in anticipation of potentially financing them in order to reduce our cost of capital 
since its inception through december   we have provided extended payment terms on approximately million of our sales  and as of december  we had approximately million of receivables in this portfolio 
general business trends and recent developments the trends  events  and uncertainties set out in this section have been identified as those we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect the comparison of historical operating results reported in this annual report to either other past period results or to future operating results 
these trends  events and uncertainties include recent establishment and expansion of energy efficiency services business in we established our energy efficiency services business through the acquisitions of parke and kapadia 
our acquisition of aem in june as well as additional acquisitions and the opening of new offices have significantly added to this segment 
our energy efficiency services business represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in certain characteristics of this new business  such as seasonality  margins and working capital requirements  are fundamentally different than those of our previous business  therefore  we believe our historical results will not be indicative of our future performance 
as an example  in and the energy efficiency services business was somewhat seasonal with a disproportionate amount of revenue recognized in the second half of the year 
this seasonality is likely to result in greater fluctuations in our revenue  earnings and working capital 
table of contents requirements throughout the year than we had experienced prior to the establishment of our energy efficiency services business 
because certain of our expenses are relatively fixed  fluctuations in the revenues of our energy efficiency services business are also likely to cause fluctuations in our earnings 
aem transaction on june   we acquired aem 
aem provides energy engineering and consulting services and energy efficiency services similar to our existing energy efficiency lighting solutions 
in addition  it provides mechanical and electrical conservation services  water conservation services  building envelope weatherization and renewable energy solutions primarily for government and municipal facilities 
aem s revenue was million 
because of the significance of this acquisition  our historical operating results are not expected to be indicative of our future operating results 
in particular  we expect our revenue and expenses to increase substantially as a result of this acquisition 
in addition  the acquisition of aem may reduce the seasonality of our consolidated revenue because aem derives the majority of its revenue from long term government contracts that are generally not seasonal in nature 
however  because a few large projects are often responsible for a significant portion of aem s annual revenue  initial project delays or gaps between projects and the level of construction activity can have a significant impact on the revenue and earnings of a particular period 
uncertainty regarding our energy technology segment in may we added the emac and umac line of hvac and lighting controllers through the acquisition of mpg 
to date  this product line has failed to reach the level of sales necessary to achieve profitability 
in late we commissioned an independent review of the market for the emac which concluded that there appears to be an attractive market for the product 
we therefore began an engineering project to replace certain components of the emac and to add cellular communications capabilities 
total research and development costs incurred in connection with the emac upgrades were approximately    and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the project has experienced delays and cost overruns and  due to the limited availability of certain discontinued components for the existing version of the emac line  resulted in lower than expected sales of the emac during and the energy technology segment incurred a significant loss during  in part because the sales and administrative overhead of this segment was positioned to support a higher level of emac sales than was actually achieved during the year 
these events contributed to the determination that mpg s goodwill was impaired  resulting in the million impairment charge at the end of we reduced the overhead of this segment during in an attempt to reduce its losses 
we completed the emac upgrade in the fourth quarter of  but this business  which had a heavy concentration of banks as clients  has been impacted by the current economic slow down 
while we continue to believe that there is a long term market for this segment s products  we have decided that focusing our financial resources to our growing energy efficiency business is a better use of our limited capital resources 
we have therefore begun the process of searching for a potential buyer for the business 
if we are not able to find a buyer within a reasonable period of time we will scale back the business to the minimum level required to satisfy our contractual obligations under our current monitoring contracts until they expire 

table of contents private placement on november  we entered into subscription agreements with investors to sell  units  each comprised of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional quarter share of common stock 
these investors included richard p 
kiphart  david r 
asplund  daniel w 
parke  gregory t 
barnum  david valentine and jeffrey r 
mistarz  all of whom are our directors and or officers 
the sale price was per unit  which was equal to of the volume weighted average price of our common stock for the ten days prior to closing 
the warrants allow holders to purchase a share of common stock for per share  which was the closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the closing  and the warrants are exercisable any time after may  and before november  the total gross proceeds raised in the private placement was  the private placement closed in two tranches tranche a  comprised of unaffiliated investors  closed on november  and raised  and tranche b comprised of affiliated investors closed on january  and raised  proceeds from the private placement will be used for general corporate purposes 
recapitalization on november   we entered into a preferred stock purchase agreement with richard p 
kiphart  under which we sold mr 
kiphart  shares of our newly created series a preferred stock in exchange for his agreement to cancel a promissory note we issued in the then outstanding amount of  the recapitalization 
the note bore interest at per annum and would have matured on march  each outstanding share of series a preferred stock is entitled to cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate of i per annum of its stated value  which is per share  on or prior to march  payable in cash and payable in additional shares of series a preferred stock  and ii per annum of its stated value at any time on or after april  payable in cash and payable in additional shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock on a for basis anytime after december   subject to adjustment 
each share of series a preferred stock is currently entitled to votes and the series a preferred stock votes along with the common stock 
in connection with this recapitalization  we removed million in liabilities from our balance sheet and classified the series a preferred stock as equity 
advb acquisition on november   we entered into a stock purchase agreement with controlling stockholders of advanced biotherapy  inc advb  pursuant to which we agreed to acquire of the outstanding capital stock of advb at per share in exchange for their shares of our common stock 
through a short form merger  we offered the remaining advb stockholders the same consideration for their common stock 
on march   we completed the merger and acquired advb 
advb s assets included approximately million of cash and an  note receivable 
advb s assets also included a revolving credit note due by us  which had an outstanding balance of approximately  as of the closing 
we have cancelled the revolving credit note 
we do not intend to continue to operate advb s prior business and consider the transaction to have been in substance an equity offering in which we issued shares of our common stock in return for approximately million in cash and notes receivable 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under 
table of contents different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  warranty accrual  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue and profit recognition we recognize our revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence has been received that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and client acceptance 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
historically  we have recognized revenue primarily on a completed contract basis 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized once the project is substantially complete  resulting in some variability in revenue 
this method works well with projects that are smaller and shorter in duration 
aem  however  recognizes  and will continue to recognize  all of its revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
aem s projects generally are larger in terms of revenue and longer in duration  therefore  aem recognizes revenue throughout the term of the project on a percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred 
this accuracy of the estimates generated using this method is dependant on our ability to accurately estimate the remaining cost to complete the project 
because aem represented approximately of our revenue  we expect at least for the near future that the majority of our revenue will be recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
under both methods of revenue recognition  any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
in our energy technology segment  we often bundle contracts to provide monitoring services and web access with the sale of our emac hardware 
as a result  these sales are considered to be contracts with multiple deliverables which  at the time the hardware is delivered and installed  includes undelivered services essential to the functionality of the product 
accordingly  we defer the revenue for the product and services and the cost of the equipment and installation and recognize them over the term of the monitoring contract 
our monitoring contracts typically vary in length from one month to five years  with the majority of the contracts having one year terms 
revenue from our financial services segment represents small administrative fees on the creation of extended payment arrangements between our wholly owned financing subsidiary and commercial and industrial clients that participate in our extended payment program 
when an extended payment agreement is recorded  we are required to discount the receivable using a market rate of interest that would generally be available to our clients  and amortize the discount over the term of the receivable as 
table of contents interest income 
as a result  a significant majority of the earnings of the financial services segment are recognized as interest income 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance is largely based upon specific knowledge of clients from whom collection is determined to be doubtful and our historical collection experience with such clients 
if the financial condition of our clients or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  or if our estimates of certain clients ability to pay are incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
during we increased our allowance by  and wrote off receivables of  as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  or of our outstanding accounts receivable 
amortization of intangibles we account for acquisitions of companies in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and intangible assets based on their fair values  with the excess of purchase price amount being allocated to goodwill 
the determination of the fair values of these intangible assets is based on a number of significant assumptions as determined by us  including evaluations of the future income producing capabilities of these assets and related future expected cash flows or replacement cost of the asset 
we also make estimates about the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets 
should different conditions result in the determination that the value of the acquired intangible assets has been impaired  we could incur write downs of intangible assets  or changes in the estimation of useful lives of those intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment testing which is discussed in greater detail below 
intangible assets included acquired technology  customer and contractual relationships  client backlog  non competition agreements and trade names 
acquired technology was initially recorded at fair value based on the estimated after tax cost to replace the asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer and contractual relationships represent contractual and separable relationships that we have with certain customers and partners 
these contractual relationships were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows and are amortized over their estimated useful life 
non competition agreements were initially recorded based on the present value of potential profits that could be lost  should the individual initiate a competing enterprise  and are amortized over the minimum term of the non competition agreements 
trade name intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the royalty payments that would need to be paid for the development and use of a comparable trade name should the name be unavailable to us 
trade name intangible assets are deemed to have an indeterminate life and are not amortized 
impairment loss we evaluate all of our long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill and fixed assets  periodically for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our 
table of contents estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
during we determined that our energysaver based virtual negawatt power plan vnpp asset was completely impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the asset to zero 
goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is less than value based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
many assumptions and estimates underlie the determination of an impairment loss  including economic and competitive conditions  operating costs and efficiencies 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
during the fourth quarter of we updated our projections for portions of the energy efficiency services and energy technology businesses and estimated the fair value based on the discounted current value of the estimated future cash flows 
we then compared the calculated fair values of the reporting units to their carrying values 
the analysis did not identify any impairment for the energy efficiency services business  but did indicate that the value of the energy technology s goodwill was impaired 
the decline in the fair value of the energy technology segment was primarily the result of lower than expected sales of the emac line of hvac controllers  in large part due to delays in a project to replace certain obsolete emac components 
as a result of the decline in the fair value  we recorded an impairment loss of million during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of we updated our analyses for the energy efficiency services business and concluded that the implied fair value of the businesses based on the discounted current value of the estimated future cash flows exceeded the carrying value  indicating that the goodwill was not impaired 
it is possible that upon completion of future impairment tests  as the result of changes in facts or circumstances  we may have to take additional charges in future periods to recognize a further write down of the value of the goodwill attributed to our acquisitions to their estimated fair values 
the acquisition of aem resulted in the creation of approximately million of amortizable intangible assets and million of goodwill 
the intangible assets  which include aem s customer lists  customer contracts  technology and sales pipeline  will be amortized over periods ranging from one to years 
as of december   there was no indication of impairment of aem s goodwill 
we will evaluate aem s goodwill annually for indications of impairment beginning in stock based compensation we have a stock incentive plan that provides for stock based employee compensation  including the granting of stock options and shares of restricted stock  to certain key employees 
the plan is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires that we record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options and restricted stock unit grants  over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock compensation using the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion 
table of contents no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under that method  compensation expense was recorded only if the current market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeded the option exercise price 
since stock options are granted at exercise prices that are greater than or equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant under our stock incentive plan  no compensation expense related to stock options was recorded in our consolidated statements of operations prior to january  we recognized million  million and million of stock compensation expense during  and  respectively 
results of operations revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our services as well as the sale of our proprietary products and the products that we purchase and resell to our clients 
all of our revenue is earned in the united states 
energy efficiency services segment revenue from our energy efficiency services business includes charges for our engineering  installation and or project management services and the materials we purchase and resell to our clients 
the substantial majority of our energy efficiency services revenue is derived from fixed price contracts  although we occasionally bill on a time and materials basis 
under fixed price contracts  we bill our clients for each project once the project is completed or throughout the project as specified in the contract 
under time and materials arrangements  we bill our clients on an hourly basis with material costs and other reimbursable expenses passed through and recognized as revenue 
historically  our projects have typically been completed within one to three weeks  with the exception of a few multi month projects 
with the addition of aem  the number of multi month projects have increased significantly  as historically  aem s projects have typically taken four to eight months to complete 
energy technology segment revenue from our energy technology business includes charges for the sale of our emac umac line of controllers  installation of the product and for ongoing monitoring services associated with the product 
in our energy technology segment  we often bundle contracts to provide monitoring services and web access with the sale of our emac hardware 
as a result  these sales are considered to be contracts with multiple deliverables which  at the time the hardware is delivered and installed  includes undelivered services essential to the functionality of the product 
accordingly  we defer the revenue for the product and services and the cost of the equipment and installation and recognize them over the term of the monitoring contract 
our monitoring contracts typically vary in length from one month to five years  with the majority of the contracts having one year terms 
financial services segment revenue from our financial services segment represents small administrative fees on the creation of extended payment arrangements between our wholly owned financing subsidiary and commercial and industrial clients that participate in our extended payment program 
when an extended payment agreement is recorded  we discount the receivable using a market rate of interest that would generally be available to our customer  and amortize the discount over the term of the receivable as interest income 
as a result  a majority of the earnings of the financial services segment are recognized as interest income 

table of contents gross profit gross profit equals our revenue less costs of sales 
the cost of sales for our energy efficiency services business consists primarily of materials  our internal labor  including engineering  and the cost of subcontracted labor 
the costs of sales for our energy technology business include charges from the contract manufacturer that manufactures the emac line of controllers  the costs of our internal labor and outside contractors used to install our product in our clients facilities  depreciation and charges for potential future warranty claims 
gross profit is a key metric that we use to examine our performance 
gross profit depends in part on the volume and mix of products and services that we sell during any given period 
a portion of our expenses  such as the cost of certain salaried project management and engineering personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  an increase in the volume of sales will generally result in an increase to our margins since these fixed expenses are not expected to increase proportionately with sales 
our business is also seasonal  as such  our margins will vary with seasonal changes in our revenue due to the fixed nature of some of our costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include the following components direct labor and commission costs related to our employee sales force  costs of our non production management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  including the costs of stock based compensation  costs related to insurance  travel and entertainment  office supplies and utilities  costs related to marketing and advertising our products  legal and accounting expenses  research and development expenses  and costs related to administrative functions that serve to support our existing businesses  as well as to provide the infrastructure for future growth 
amortization of intangibles we incur expenses related to the amortization of identifiable assets that we have capitalized in connection with our acquisitions 
other expense other expense consists of interest expense  net of interest earned on our investments 
interest expense represents the interest costs and fees associated with our subordinated convertible term notes including amortization of the related debt discount and issuance costs  our lines of credit  the mortgage on our headquarters building  notes payable and various vehicle loans 
interest income includes earnings on our invested cash balances and amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
dividend expense dividend expense includes dividends accrued on our preferred stock and charges for non cash deemed dividends

by comparison  the energy efficiency services  energy technology and financial services segments were responsible for  and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 

table of contents revenue from our energy efficiency services business increased  or from  in to  in revenue generated by aem  which was acquired in june  was responsible for approximately million of the increase in revenue 
the balance of the increase was the result of higher sales from our existing businesses due largely to increased productivity from our sales force 
we expect revenue to increase as a result of the inclusion of a full twelve months of results from aem and the continued grow of our existing businesses 
revenue from our energy technology business declined  or to  in from  in the decline in this segment s revenue was largely due to limited availability of product resulting from delays in the completion of a project to upgrade the emac to replace components that are no longer available 
this upgrade was completed during the fourth quarter of  but this segment  which had a significant number of banks as clients  has been impacted by the current economic slowdown 
we have reduced the headcount in this segment in response to the current market conditions and are currently seeking to sell the business  therefore we do not expect this segment to contribute significantly to our revenue 
revenue from our financial services segment increased  to  in from  in in late we made the decision to significantly reduce the number of extended payment agreements we are offering clients in order to conserve cash due to the uncertainty of the current financial environment 
we therefore do not expect significant revenue from this segment during we believe that there will be slightly less seasonality in our revenue in than experienced in  in part due to the acquisition of aem 
though  we still expect that the majority of our revenue will be earned in the second half of the year 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased  or to  during from  earned in  while our gross margin declined to during from in the increase in our gross profit was directly related to the increase in our sales during the year 
the decline in our gross margin was to attributable to lower sales at our energy technology segment  a change in the mix of our sales revenue and the acquisition of aem 
while we believe that there will be opportunities to increase our gross margin in future periods  our ability to do so will in part depend in part on future competitive and economic conditions

the higher personnel costs were the result of inclusion of acquisitions for a full year and new hires in sales and administration 
these increases were partially offset by the elimination of  of one time registration penalties included in the sg a and a  reduction in share based compensation expense 
we expect our sg a expense to increase moderately during  as the result of the inclusion of a full months of expense from aem and the hiring of additional sales people 
amortization of intangibles

our principal cash requirements are for operating expenses  including employee costs  the cost of outside services including those providing contract manufacturing  accounting  legal  engineering and electrical  mechanical and plumbing contracting services  and the funding of inventory and accounts receivable  and capital expenditures 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the private placement of our common and preferred stock  as well as through various forms of secured debt

to get a better understanding of cash sources and uses  we like to split the cash used or provided by operating activities into two pieces the cash consumed or generated by operating activities before changes in working capital  and the cash consumed or generated from changes in working capital 
the cash consumed by operating activities before changes in working capital increased  or to  during as compared to  during our operating loss  excluding non cash charges depreciation  amortization  share based compensation and impairment losses declined  or to  during from  in due to increased sales and reduced sg a expense as a percentage of revenue 
this was more than offset by increased interest expense resulting from borrowings under a new line of credit to fund the acquisition of aem and increased working capital 
we believe that we will see additional reductions in the cash consumed by operating activities before changes in working capital if our revenue and profitability continue to improve 
table of contents as we believe they will  to the point that our operations will begin to generate cash before changes in working capital in future periods 
changes in working capital consumed  during  an increase of  or from the  consumed in the increase in working capital was largely the result of a increase in revenue during we expect our working capital requirements to continue to increase with increases in our sales in future periods  though we hope improvements in our receivables turnover and reductions in our inventory will keep the growth in working capital to a rate that is lower than the growth of our future sales 
investing activities cash consumed in investing activities increased  or to  during from  in cash used for acquisitions increased  to  during from  during we acquired aem  while in we acquired texas energy products and preferred lighting 
the cash used to fund capital expenditures declined  or to  in from  in capital investments were primarily for delivery service vehicles while capital investments included the purchase of delivery service vehicles and a new accounting system and related hardware 
financing activities net cash generated by financing activities increased  to  in from  during early in we began to work with an investment bank on a public sale of shares of our common stock 
this offering was put on hold in may when the opportunity to acquire aem materialized 
we resumed work on the offering in july  but determined in august that due to deteriorating market conditions  it was unlikely that we would be successful raising capital in the public markets 
we instead decided to use much of the material prepared for the public offering in a private offering to a small group of sophisticated investors 
we closed a million private placement in november the first million tranche of the private placement  which included non affiliated investors closed on november   while the second tranche  which included affiliated investors  closed in january following the completion of mailing to our stockholders as required by sec rules 
we incurred  in expense related to our fund raising efforts 
also during we drew  on our line of credit to fund the acquisition of aem   to fund an equity infusion into aem to assist with its working capital requirements and million to fund the consolidated working capital and general operating requirements of the company 
we also borrowed  to fund the acquisition of service delivery vehicles and made scheduled payments of  on our mortgage and various other notes

also during we sold all of the stock of great lakes controlled energy corporation to the former owners of that company 
great lakes cash balances of  were transferred with the sale of the company 
fixed asset purchases increased  to  during from  during the increase was primarily related to purchases of additional delivery vehicles required to support our increased level of business activity and acquisition of a new accounting system and related hardware 
financing activities financing activities generated cash of  during as compared to generating  during in april we received the proceeds from a stockholder rights offering which raised  and incurred issuance costs of  during may and june of we raised  through the issuance of subordinated convertible term notes to a group of eight investors  incurring issuance costs of  in the process 
we also borrowed  during to fund the purchase of new delivery vehicles  made scheduled payments of  on our mortgage and vehicle loans and received  from the exercise of options and warrants 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash reserves  which were  on december   million we raised in january upon the closing of the second tranche of the november private placement and approximately million of cash we gained access to upon the closing of the acquisition of advb in early march during fiscal  operating activities consumed cash of million 
our ability to continue to expand the sales of our products and services will require the continued commitment of significant funds 
the actual timing and amount of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount  timing and profitability of future revenues  working capital requirements  the level and amount of product marketing and sales efforts and the magnitude of research and development  among other things 
we have raised a significant amount of capital since our formation through the issuance of shares of our common and preferred stock and notes  which has allowed us acquire companies and to continue to execute our business plan 
most of these funds have been consumed by operating activities  either to fund our losses or for working capital requirements 
in an attempt to move the company to a position where it 
table of contents can start to generate positive cash flow our management has set the following key strategies for cash flow improvement in focus on increasing the sales and profitability of our products and services 
we believe that to a great degree our ability to generate positive cash flows is dependent on our ability to increase sales while holding or improving our margins 
our revenue in the fourth quarter of was million  exceeding the amount earned in any prior quarterly period 
it was also the first quarter in our history in which our cash earnings earnings excluding depreciation  amortization and share based compensation exceeded our interest and dividend expense 
we believe that our current infrastructure can support a sales level that will generate positive cash earnings on a full year basis 
we also believe there are opportunities to improve our margins  which will help to reduce the level of sales at which we will begin to generate positive cash flows before changes in working capital 
sell or shut down our energy technology business 
our energy technology business recorded an operating loss of  during and  during including a  impairment charge 
we have invested approximately million in the upgrade of the emac technology over the past three years  completing the project in the fourth quarter of unfortunately banks represent a large portion of the target market for the emac technology and most of our bank emac clients are deferring purchase decisions due to the current turmoil in their industry and the economy in general 
while we continue to believe that there is a long term market for this segment s products  we have decided that focusing our financial resources to our growing energy efficiency business is a better use of our limited capital resources 
we have therefore begun the process of searching for a potential buyer for the business 
if we are not able to find a buyer within a reasonable period of time we will scale back the business to the minimum level required to satisfy our contractual obligations under our current monitoring contracts until they expire 
aggressively manage our costs in order to conserve cash 
the prudent use of the capital resources available to us remains one of our top priorities 
we are constantly reviewing our operations looking for more efficient ways to achieve our objectives 
we believe that if we are successful in achieving these priorities we should have sufficient liquidity to allow us to operate until our operations turn cash flow positive 
if we are not able to achieve some or all of these priorities  we may begin to experience a liquidity shortage in the latter half of which could force us to raise additional capital  scale back our growth plans  or in the worst case cease operations 
if in the future we raise additional capital which may require stockholder approval  our existing stockholders  to the extent they do not participate in the capital raise  will likely experience dilution of their present equity ownership position and voting rights  depending upon the number of shares issued and the terms and conditions of the issuance 
if we raise capital through the issuance of additional equity  the new equity securities issued may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock
