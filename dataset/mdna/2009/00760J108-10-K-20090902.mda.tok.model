critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s selling arrangements may include contractual customer acceptance provisions 
installation of products occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  corrected copy  which requires revenue to be recognized upon the shipment of products or the performance of services when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until such acceptance occurs 
when multiple elements exist  the company allocates the purchase price based on vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of fair value and defers revenue recognition on the undelivered portion 
historically  these multiple deliverables have included items such as extended support provisions  training to be supplied after delivery of the systems  and test programs specific to customers routine applications 
the test programs can be written either by the customer  other firms  or the company 
the amount of revenue deferred is the greater of the fair value of the undelivered element or the contractually agreed to amounts 
sales tax collected from customers is not included in revenue but rather recorded as a liability due to the respective taxing authorities 
royalty based revenue related to licensing income from performance test boards and burn in boards is recognized upon the earlier of the receipt by the company of the licensee s report related to its usage of the licensed intellectual property or upon payment by the licensee 
this revenue is recorded in net sales 
provisions for the estimated future cost of warranty and installation are recorded at the time the products are shipped 
the company s terms of sales with distributors are generally fob shipping point with payment due within days 
the only right of return is if the equipment does not meet the published specifications 
all products go through in house testing and verification of specifications before shipment 
apart from warranty reserves  credits issued have not been material as a percentage of net sales 
the company s distributors do not generally carry inventories of the company s products 
instead  the distributors place orders with the company at or about the time they receive orders from their customers 
the company s shipment terms to our distributors do not provide for credits or rights of return 
because the company s distributors do not generally carry inventories of our products  they do not have rights to price protection or to return products 
at the time the company ships products to the distributors  the price is fixed 
subsequent to the issuance of the invoice  there are no discounts or special terms 
paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  is not applicable because the company does not give the buyer the right to return the product or to receive future price concessions

 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company capitalizes its systems software development costs incurred after a system achieves technological feasibility and before first commercial shipment 
such costs typically represent a small portion of total research and development costs 
no system software development costs were capitalized or amortized in fiscal  or allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade receivables 
the company also reviews its trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collection issues 
the company exercises judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as the company evaluates historical bad debt trends  general economic conditions in the united states and internationally  and changes in customer financial conditions 
uncollectible receivables are recorded as bad debt expense when all efforts to collect have been exhausted and recoveries are recognized when they are received 
warranty obligations the company provides and records the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
the company s estimate of warranty reserve is based on management s assessment of future warranty obligations and on historical warranty obligations 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could affect how the company accounts for expenses 
inventory obsolescence in each of the last three fiscal years  the company has written down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required

the company has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants  or from intellectual property infringement or other claims 
these agreements may limit the time period within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 
in addition  the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors  and the company s bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to the company s agents 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosures of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosures of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative commodity instruments 
the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at may  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
through april  the company invested excess cash in a managed portfolio of corporate and government bond instruments with maturities of months or less 
beginning in may  the company adopted a revised cash investment policy which only invests in government backed securities with maturities of months or less 
the company does not use any financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a majority of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
the company  however  enters into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen us dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from purchase order to ultimate payment 
this exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent that the company s japanese subsidiary incurs expenses payable in yen 
to date  the company has not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks 
in addition  the company s japanese subsidiary typically carries debt or other obligations due to the company that may be denominated in either yen or us dollars 
since the japanese subsidiary s financial statements are based in yen and the company s consolidated financial statements are based in us dollars  the japanese subsidiary and the company recognize foreign exchange gain or loss in any period in which the value of the yen rises or falls in relation to the us dollar 
a decrease in the value of the yen as compared with the us dollar would not be expected to result in a significant change to the company s net income or loss
