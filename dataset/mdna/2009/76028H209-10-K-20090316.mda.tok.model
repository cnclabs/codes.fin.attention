item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview repros therapeutics inc the company  rprx  repros  or we  us or our was organized on august  we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule drugs for major unmet medical needs 
our current product pipeline with the respective status of development consists of the following proellex female reproductive health phase three month pre surgical treatment for women with anemia due to excessive menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids  or anemia associated with uterine fibroids  who may consider having a subsequent hysterectomy phase chronic treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids phase chronic treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis androxal male reproductive health phase b proof of concept trial in men being treated for low testosterone levels who want to improve or maintain their fertility and or sperm number and function we intend to file an investigational new drug application  or ind  in the first half of for androxal as a treatment for type diabetes our lead drug  proellex  is a selective blocker of the progesterone receptor and previously was primarily being developed for the chronic treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis 
during the first quarter of we filed an ind for proellex for a new indication as a short course pre surgical treatment of anemia associated with uterine fibroids 
uterine fibroids  anemia associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis affect a significant number of women of childbearing age in the developed world 
there is no currently approved effective long term drug treatment for uterine fibroids or endometriosis 
in the united states alone  approximately  women per year undergo a hysterectomy as a result of severe uterine fibroids 
during the first quarter of we initiated activities relating to the following proellex clinical trials for patients with uterine fibroids two patient registration pivotal phase clinical trials zpu and zpu with proellex as a pre surgical treatment for women with anemia associated with uterine fibroids who may consider having a subsequent hysterectomy two patient registration pivotal phase clinical trials zpu and zpu with proellex for the chronic treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids two patient open label safety trials zpu and zpu with proellex for the chronic treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids during we also had the following ongoing clinical development activities relating to proellex one us open label safety clinical trial zpu ext with proellex for the treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids which was conducted with patients previously treated in our prior us phase zpu clinical trial one us phase clinical trial zpe with proellex for the treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis several phase clinical safety trials 
table of contents continued preclinical animal safety studies manufacturing production related activities we currently do not have reliable estimates regarding the timing of our proellex clinical trials 
the length of time required to complete phase  phase and phase clinical trials and long term open label safety studies may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
we have had difficulty recruiting patients into our proellex clinical trials primarily due to the various test procedures that are required for a patient to be treated for these three indications  which includes multiple endometrial biopsies 
in addition  patients being treated for anemia associated with uterine fibroids who may elect to have hysterectomies post treatment have encountered both patients and doctors not wanting to be a part of those clinical trials due to this requirement 
we have recently removed this requirement and will leave this procedure up to the patient and their physician 
notwithstanding the uncertainty described above  we currently estimate completion of our proellex projects and the submission of a nda under the following timelines pre surgical treatment of anemia associated with uterine fibroids treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids late treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis late our second product candidate  androxal  is a single isomer of clomiphene citrate and is an orally active proprietary small molecule compound 
we were previously developing androxal in the united states to treat testosterone deficiency due to secondary hypogonadism by restoring normal testosterone production in males with functional testes and diminished pituitary function  a common condition in the aging male 
based on a type c meeting held with the food and drug administration  or fda  on october  we believe that we do not have a clear clinical path to develop androxal for this indication in the us at this time 
although we believe androxal could be developed outside of the us  due to the limited european market for this indication and our limited internal resources we do not intend to pursue approval outside of the us at this time 
during the second quarter of  we initiated a patient phase b proof of concept clinical trial za for a new indication in which we are monitoring the effects of androxal on male fertility and testicular function in patients being treated for low testosterone as compared to testim  a popular marketed topical testosterone medication 
we anticipate holding an end of phase meeting with the fda during the second half of at this time it is too early in the clinical development process to estimate when or even if a nda will be filed with androxal for this indication 
in april  repros submitted a white paper to the division of reproductive and urology products  which we believe demonstrated in a previous conducted non pivotal phase clinical trial za with androxal for the treatment of testosterone deficiency due to secondary hypogonadism  that there was a statistically significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose and a higher response rate in subjects with a plasma glucose of greater than or equal to mg dl who were treated with androxal as compared with the placebo or androgel  a popular marketed topical testosterone medication 
in november  we received guidance from the fda suggesting submission of a new ind to the division of metabolic and endocrine products  or dmep  for the investigation of androxal as a potential treatment for type diabetes 
we plan to submit a new ind for this indication to the dmep in the first half of we anticipate conducting a phase b proof of concept clinical trial with androxal post feedback from the fda relating to this indication 
at this time it is too early in the clinical development process to estimate when or even if a nda will be filed with androxal for this indication 
this new indication replaces our previously announced plan to develop androxal in men with adult onset idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism  or aihh  with concomitant plasma glucose and lipid elevations  all of which are components of metabolic syndrome 
during  we also continued our androxal patient long term open label safety study za ext and preclinical animal safety studies that will be used to support any potential future androxal clinical regulatory submissions 
we also continue to maintain our patent portfolio of our phentolamine based products for the treatment of sexual dysfunction 
we continue to try to create value from these assets in various ways which includes product out licensing 
the clinical development of pharmaceutical products is a complex undertaking  and many products that begin the clinical development process do not obtain regulatory approval 
the costs associated with our clinical trials may be impacted by a number of internal and external factors  including the number and complexity of clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval  the number of eligible patients necessary to complete our clinical trials and any difficulty in enrolling these patients  and the length of time to complete our clinical trials 
given the uncertainty of these potential costs  we recognize that the total costs we will incur for the clinical development of our product candidates may exceed our current estimates 
we do  however  expect these costs to increase in year as compared to year as we continue with later stage clinical trials  increase patient randomization into our larger open label safety clinical trials  potentially initiate new clinical trials for additional indications and seek to obtain regulatory approvals 

table of contents any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as with most biotechnology companies with drug candidates in development  the path to marketing approval by the us food and drug administration  or the fda  and comparable foreign agencies for each such candidate is long and uncertain 
the regulatory process  both domestically and abroad  is a multi year process with no certainty when and if a drug candidate will be approved for commercial use 
the development path for a particular drug candidate typically includes a variety of clinical trials 
while we have a general estimate of the timeframe for our clinical trials  the actual anticipated completion dates for each of our drug candidates are uncertain due to a wide variety of risks  including those described in the risk factors in this form k 
the length of time for a clinical trial may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
for example  we have revised our original estimates for clinical trial completion and related new drug application  or nda  dates on several occasions over the past two years based on data received from our clinical trials to date 
in addition  it may be necessary to undertake additional unanticipated clinical trials during the development path 
we will not receive any revenue from commercial sales unless we  or a potential partner  complete the clinical trial process  obtain regulatory approval  and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
similarly  we do not have a reasonable basis to predict when or if material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our drug candidates will occur 
to date  we have not commercialized any of our drug candidates to any material extent and in fact may never do so 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and costs of completing the development of the company s drug candidates  see the section titled risk factors 
our results of operations may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter  and depend  among other factors  on our ability to be successful in our clinical trials  the regulatory approval process in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions and the ability to complete new licenses and product development agreements 
the timing of our revenues may not match the timing of our associated product development expenses 
to date  research and development expenses have generally exceeded revenue in any particular period and or fiscal year 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million and had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception and have funded our activities to date primarily from equity financings and corporate collaborations 
based on our current planned clinical programs  we will need to raise additional capital in the third quarter of we believe we can secure additional cash resources through either the sale of our equity securities or through potential regional out licensing of proellex 
it is possible that our current clinical trial activities will be more costly and take longer than we anticipate  accordingly  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be necessary prior to the time anticipated 
we believe that we will secure sufficient capital to continue our currently planned clinical programs without any significant delay or impact on such programs  assuming that the results of our ongoing proellex clinical trials are favorable 
if the results of these trials are unfavorable  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining additional capital in amounts sufficient to continue to fund its operations through either the out licensing of proellex  the sale of equity securities  or other alternative sources of funding  which outcome would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the uncertainties relating to the foregoing matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market under our ticker symbol  rprx 
effective january   we voluntarily withdrew the listing of our common stock from nyse arca  inc  formerly the pacific exchange  in order to streamline administrative requirements and reduce expenses 
we are an accelerated filer and are subject to additional financial regulatory requirements  including section of sarbanes oxley  which requires us to include in this annual report a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditor s report 
these additional activities have resulted in increased costs to us and will result in future increased costs as we maintain compliance with these requirements 
we have full time employees who utilize the services of contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and various consultants to assist us in performing clinical and regulatory services for the clinical development of our products 
we are substantially dependent on our various contract groups to adequately perform the activities required to obtain regulatory approval of our products 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  the value of the tax asset associated with this accumulated deficit can be substantially diminished in value to us due to various tax regulations  including change in control provisions in the tax code 
for additional information relating to our net operating loss carryforward  see note federal income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in conducting clinical 
table of contents trials for our product candidates  in research and development activities related to efforts to develop our products and from the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the transition from a development stage company to the successful introduction of commercially viable products 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend  among other things  on successfully completing the clinical development of our products in a reasonable time frame and at a reasonable cost  obtaining regulatory approvals  establishing marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities or collaborative arrangements with others that possess such capabilities  our and our partners ability to realize value from our research and development programs through the commercialization of those products and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability or that profitability  if achieved  can be sustained

critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
please see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies 
a brief summary of our accounting policies is provided below 
investments management determines the appropriate classification of investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates such designation as of each subsequent balance sheet date 
debt securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
securities we designate as trading securities are recorded at fair value 
gains and losses on trading securities  realized and unrealized  are included in earnings and are calculated using the specific identification method 
any other securities are classified as available for sale 
due to the volatility of the financial markets at december   we had no marketable securities and held our cash in either an insured bank account or a money market mutual fund backed by us securities 
at december   all securities were classified as trading securities 
prior to the disruption of the financial markets  our investments typically included corporate bonds and notes  euro dollar bonds  taxable auction securities and asset backed securities 
our policy is to require minimum credit ratings of a a and a p with maturities of up to three years  excluding taxable auction securities 
these securities were classified as trading securities and were valued in our financial statements at their fair value 
our policy required that the average life of the investment portfolio  excluding taxable auction securities  may not exceed months 
capitalized patent costs we capitalize the cost associated with building our patent library for proellex and androxal 
as of december   other assets consist of capitalized patent costs in the amount of  patent costs  which include legal and application costs related to the patent portfolio  are being amortized over years  or the lesser of the legal or the estimated economic life of the patent 
amortization of patent costs was   and in  and  respectively 
of the  in capitalized patents   related to proellex patents and  related to androxal patents 
we review capitalized patent costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the patent are less than its carrying amount 
the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the patent cost as compared to its estimated fair value 
we believe that our capitalized patent costs are not impaired as of december  accrued expenses we estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements 
examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for clinical trials  preclinical development and manufacturing of clinical materials 
we accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials or services provided and the invoices received from our external service providers 
in the case of clinical trials  a portion of the estimated cost normally relates to the projected cost to treat a patient in our trials  and we recognize this cost over the estimated term of the study based on the number of patients enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis  beginning with patient enrollment 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
however  we are expanding the level of our clinical trials and related services 
as a result  we anticipate that our estimated accruals for clinical services will be more material to our operations in future periods 
subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals  which could also materially affect our balance sheet and results of operations 

table of contents r d expense research and development  or r d  expenses include salaries and related employee expenses  contracted regulatory affairs activities  insurance coverage for clinical trials and prior product sales  contracted research and consulting fees  facility costs and internal research and development supplies 
we expense research and development costs in the period they are incurred 
these costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects as well as fees paid to various entities that perform research on our behalf 
share based compensation we have two stock based compensation plans at december   the non employee directors stock option plan  or director plan and the stock option plan  or plan 
we account for our stock based compensation plans under fasb statement no 
r  share based payments sfas r 
sfas r generally requires the recognition of the cost of employee services for share based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
under sfas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
expected volatility is determined using historical volatilities based on historical stock prices for a period equal to the expected term 
the expected volatility assumption is adjusted if future volatility is expected to vary from historical experience 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and falls between the options vesting and contractual expiration dates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a zero coupon us treasury bond whose maturity period equals the option s expected term 
income taxes we have had losses since inception and  therefore  have not been subject to federal income taxes 
we have accumulated approximately million of research and development tax credits 
as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss  or nol  carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
additionally  approximately million of nols  and approximately  of research and development tax credits  expired in under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  an nol requires the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
however  a valuation allowance must be recorded for deferred tax assets whose recovery is deemed unlikely 
as we have incurred losses since inception  and there is no certainty of future revenues  our deferred tax assets have been reserved in full in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
issued in february  fsp application of fasb statement no 
to fasb statement no 
and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement removed leasing transactions accounted for under statement and related guidance from the scope of sfas no 
fsp partial deferral of the effective date of statement fsp  deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  the implementation of sfas no 
for financial assets and financial liabilities  effective january   did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the implementation of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this pronouncement permits entities to use the fair value method to measure certain financial assets and liabilities by electing an irrevocable option to use the fair value method at specified election dates 
after election of the option  subsequent changes in fair value would result in the recognition of unrealized gains or losses as period costs during the period the change occurred 
sfas no 
becomes effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november   with early adoption permitted 
however  entities may not retroactively apply the provisions of sfas no 
to fiscal years preceding the date of adoption 
we did not apply the fair value option under sfas  which is elective 
we have reclassified all cash flows  related to our trading securities  from operating to investing activities in the accompanying statement of cash flows to reflect the nature of the investments in accordance with paragraph of sfas in april  the fasb issued fsp  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no

our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of our products  the problems  delays  expenses and complications frequently encountered by development stage companies  the progress of our preclinical and clinical activities  the costs associated with any future collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing or other funding arrangements  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  the success of our potential future sales and marketing programs  the cost of filing  prosecuting and defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in economic  regulatory or competitive conditions of our planned business  and additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
estimates about the adequacy of funding for our activities are based on certain assumptions  that the development and regulatory approval of our products can be completed at projected costs  and that product approvals and introductions will be timely and successful 
there can be no assurance that changes in our research and development plans  acquisitions or other events will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
to satisfy our capital requirements  we may seek to raise additional funds in the public or private capital markets 
we may seek additional funding through corporate collaborations and other financing vehicles 
there can be no assurance that any such funding will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if we are successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of such financing may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of holders of our common stock 
the uncertainties relating to the foregoing matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months
