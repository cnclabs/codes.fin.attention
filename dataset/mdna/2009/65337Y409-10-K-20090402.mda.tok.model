item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
additionally  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview highlights our revenues from continuing operations for totaled million compared to million for  reflecting continued growth in our multimedia segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of certain of our owned aws spectrum licenses in the united states to third parties for net proceeds  after deducting direct and incremental selling costs  of million  and recognized gains on these sales totaling million 
the net proceeds from the sale were used to redeem a portion of the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest 
on october   we issued the second lien notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
after payment of transaction related fees and expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million to be used solely in connection with the ordinary course business operations and not for any acquisition of assets or businesses or other uses 
concurrently  we issued the third lien notes in an aggregate principal amount of million in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock 
we did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the third lien notes 
in an effort to reduce our future working capital requirements and in order to comply with the terms of our senior notes  second lien notes and third lien notes  we commenced the implementation of a global restructuring initiative  pursuant to which we completed the following actions in the second half of we sold a controlling interest in our ipwireless subsidiary for an upfront cash payment of approximately million and future cash payments of up to million  we shut down the operations of our network infrastructure businesses  which comprise our networks segment  including the operations of our go networks and cygnus subsidiaries and our global services and nextwave network support strategic business units  we initiated bankruptcy liquidation proceedings for three of our network infrastructure subsidiaries in israel  denmark and canada to provide an orderly process for the discontinuance of operations and to advance our divestiture and cost reduction strategy  we retained canaccord adams to explore strategic transactions to optimize the value of our semiconductor business and eliminate the need to make on going capital investments in or incur liabilities relating to this business  and  in the first quarter of  due to the inability to identify any such transaction  we wound down our semiconductor operations and terminated approximately employees  and we retained goetzpartners to explore the sale of our wimax telecom business in europe 
several factors led to our decision to implement our global restructuring initiative  including adverse worldwide economic conditions  which we believe have adversely affected manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and technology and caused our discontinued networks segment to experience lower than projected contract bookings and revenues 
we believe these conditions have also led to a delay in global wimax network deployments  which adversely impacted the timing and volume of projected commercial sales of wimax products of our discontinued semiconductor business 
our business and operating segments nextwave wireless inc is a holding company for mobile multimedia businesses and a significant wireless spectrum portfolio 
as a result of our global restructuring initiative  our continuing operations are focused on two key segments multimedia  consisting of the operations of our wholly owned subsidiary packetvideo  and strategic initiatives  focused on the management of our wireless spectrum interests 
in the second half of  we commenced the implementation of our global restructuring initiative in an effort to reduce our working capital requirements  narrow our business focus and reorganize our operating units 
key results of this initiative include a reduction in our global workforce  the divestiture of our ipwireless network infrastructure business  the discontinuation of operations at our go networks  cygnus  global services and nextwave networks products support infrastructure businesses  and the closing of several facilities throughout the world 
additionally  in the first quarter of  we wound down our semiconductor operations and terminated approximately employees 
we anticipate that further implementation of our global restructuring initiative will result in additional headcount reductions and operating unit divestitures or discontinuations  including the divestiture of our wimax telecom business and the sale of certain assets of our semiconductor business 
to further enhance our operational flexibility  on april   we have obtained a waiver from the holders of our senior notes  second lien notes  and third lien notes that adjusts our minimum cash balance requirement from million to million  waives certain events of default relating to timely delivery of a new operating budget  permits us to issue up to million of indebtedness on a pari passu basis with our second lien notes  and allows us to pay certain holders of our senior notes payment in kind interest at a rate of 
we also entered into a cinding commitment letter with navation  inc  an entity controlled by allen salmasi  our chairman and chief executive officer  to provide up to million of working capital financing 
we believe that the completion of the asset divestiture and cost reduction actions contemplated by our global restructuring initiative  including the divestiture or shut down of our semiconductor business  our current cash and cash equivalents  projected revenues from our multimedia segment  our committed million working capital financing and our ability to elect payment in kind interest with respect to at least in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  coupled with the reduction to the minimum cash balance requirement  will allow us to meet our estimated working capital requirements at least through december should we be unable to achieve the revenues and or cash flows for fiscal year contemplated in our operating plan  which was approved by the governance committee of our board of directors on march   we will implement certain additional actions to reduce our working capital requirements including staffing reductions  the deferral of capital expenditures associated with the build out requirements of our wireless spectrum licenses and reductions in foreign operations 
if we are unable to achieve the anticipated savings from the implementation of our global restructuring initiative  we are unable to consummate our working capital financing transaction  or if we were to incur significant unanticipated expenditures  we would be required to renegotiate our lending arrangements and we may also be required to seek additional debt and or equity financing and or further reduce discretionary spending 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
insufficient capital would significantly restrict our ability to operate and could cause us to seek relief through a filing in the u 
s bankruptcy court 
multimedia segment packetvideo was founded in and supplies multimedia software and services to many of the world s largest network operators and wireless handset manufacturers 
these companies in turn use packetvideo s platform to offer music and video services on mobile handsets  generally under their own brands 
to date  over million packetvideo powered handsets have been shipped worldwide 
packetvideo has been contracted by some of the world s largest carriers  such as orange  ntt docomo  rogers wireless  teliasonera  telus mobility  verizon wireless and vodafone india to design and implement the embedded multimedia software capabilities contained in their handsets 
packetvideo s software is compatible with virtually all network technologies including cdma  gsm  wimax  lte and wcdma 
as mobile platforms evolve  packetvideo continues to provide the best multimedia solutions 
packetvideo is one of the original founding member of the open handset alliance oha  led by google 
packetvideo s opencore platform serves as the multimedia software subsystem for the oha s mobile device android platform 
in a similar vein  packetvideo has been recognized for its support of the limo foundation and their platform initiatives 
we believe that by supporting the efforts of the oha and limo foundation  packetvideo is well positioned to market its full suite of enhanced software applications to android and limo application developers 
in addition  since packetvideo has offered software products for use on pcs  consumer electronics and other devices in the home 
we believe that media consumption in the home and media consumption on mobile handsets is converging 
packetvideo s twonkymedia product line is designed to capitalize on this trend 
packetvideo has invested in the development and acquisition of a wide range of technologies and capabilities to provide its customers with software solutions to enable home office digital media convergence using communication protocols standardized by the digital living network alliance tm 
the twonkymedia tm suite of products that provide for content search  discovery  organization and content delivery sharing amongst consumer electronics products connected to an internet protocol based network 
this powerful platform is designed to provide an enhanced user experience by intelligently responding to user preferences based on content type  day part  and content storage location 
in addition  packetvideo s patented digital rights management drm solutions  already in use by many wireless carriers globally  represent a key enabler of digital media convergence by preventing the unauthorized access or duplication of multimedia content used or shared by packetvideo enabled devices 
additionally  packetvideo is one of the largest suppliers of microsoft drm technologies for the wireless market today 
although we believe that packetvideo s products are advantageous and well positioned for success  packetvideo s business largely depends upon volume based sales of devices into the market 
the economic downturn in the global markets has affected consumer spending habits 
packetvideo s customers and distribution partners  telecommunications companies and consumer electronics device manufacturers  are not immune to such uncertain and adverse market conditions 
packetvideo relies on these partners as distribution avenues for its developed products 
additionally  competitive pressures may cause further price wars in an effort to win or sustain business which will have an effect on overall margins and projections 
if economic conditions continue to deteriorate  this may result in lower than expected sales volumes  resulting in lower revenue  gross margins  and operating income 
strategic initiatives segment our strategic initiatives business segment is engaged in the management of our global wireless spectrum holdings 
our total spectrum holdings consist of approximately ten billion mhz points of presence pops  covering approximately million pops  of which million pops are covered by mhz or more of spectrum  and an additional million pops are covered by at least mhz of spectrum 
in addition  a number of markets  including much of the new york metropolitan region  are covered by mhz or more of spectrum 
our domestic spectrum resides in the ghz wireless communication services wcs  ghz broadband radio service brs educational broadband service ebs  and ghz advanced wireless services aws bands and offers propagation and other characteristics suitable to support high capacity  mobile broadband services 
our international spectrum holdings include nationwide ghz licenses in austria  croatia  germany  slovakia and switzerland  a nationwide ghz license in norway  ghz licenses in canada  and ghz licenses in argentina and chile  covering million pops 
we continue to pursue the sale of our wireless spectrum holdings and have engaged deutsche bank and ubs investment bank to explore the sale of our domestic wireless spectrum holdings  canaccord adams to explore the sale of our canadian wireless spectrum holdings and goetzpartners to explore the sale of our wimax telecom business in europe 
additionally  we are actively marketing for sale our wireless spectrum holdings in argentina and chile 
any sale or transfer of the ownership of our wireless spectrum holdings is subject to regulatory approval 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of certain of our owned aws spectrum licenses in the united states covering million pops to third parties for net proceeds  after deducting direct and incremental selling costs  of million  and recognized gains on these sales totaling million 
the net proceeds from the sale were used to redeem a portion of the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest 
we realized a significant return on our original investment in these licenses 
however  there can be no assurance that we will realize a similar return upon the sale of our remaining wireless spectrum holdings 
although we believe that the fair value of our wireless spectrum assets at least approximates the carrying value  the sale price of our wireless spectrum assets will be impacted by  among other things the fcc s final resolution of ongoing proceedings regarding interference from satellite digital audio radio services to our wcs spectrum licenses  the timing and associated costs of build out or substantial service requirements attached to our domestic and international spectrum licenses  where a failure to comply with these requirements could result in license forfeiture  timing of closure of potential sales  particular if it is necessary to accelerate the planned sale of certain of our spectrum licenses in order to meet debt payment obligations  worldwide economic conditions which we believe have adversely affected manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and technology and led to a delay in global wimax network deployments  and availability of capital for prospective spectrum buyers has been negatively impacted by the downturn in the credit and financial markets 
as we have previously disclosed  our efforts to sell our wireless spectrum holdings on favorable terms has been delayed by current market conditions  as well as regulatory and other market activities involving potential buyers 
we are continuing to have discussions with numerous parties who have expressed interest in our various spectrum assets 
however  we believe that adverse economic conditions continue to affect potential purchasers of our wireless spectrum  and there can be no assurance as to the timing of further spectrum sales or the sales prices that will be attained 
results of operations our results of operations include the results of operations of acquired companies from the date of the respective acquisitions 
the results of operations of our networks segment  which includes our go networks  ipwireless and cygnus subsidiaries  and our global services and nextwave network product support strategic business units  our semiconductor segment and our wimax telecom business  have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
comparison of our fiscal year ended december  to our fiscal year ended december  continuing operations revenues total revenues from continuing operations for were million  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
total revenues for both periods consist entirely of revenues generated by our multimedia segment 
the increase in revenues was attributable to unit sales growth and increased market penetration of mobile subscriber services by our customer base  which includes wireless operators and device manufacturers 
sales to three multimedia customers  verizon wireless  ntt docomo and sony ericsson  accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues from continuing operations during sales to one multimedia customer  verizon wireless  accounted for of our total revenues from continuing operations during in general  the financial consideration received from wireless carriers and mobile phone and wireless device manufacturers is primarily derived from a combination of technology development contracts  royalties  software support and maintenance and wireless broadband products 
we expect that revenues from our multimedia segment for fiscal year will be affected by the current adverse worldwide economic conditions  and among other things  new product and service introductions  competitive conditions  customer marketing budgets for introduction of new subscriber products  the rate of expansion of our customer base  the build out rate of wireless networks  price increases  subscriber device life cycles and demand for wireless data services 
operating expenses years ended in millions december  december  increase decrease cost of technology licensing and service revenues engineering  research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges asset impairment charges purchased in process research and development total operating expenses cost of technology  licensing and service revenues cost of technology licensing and service revenues from continuing operations as a percentage of the associated revenues for was  as compared to for the improvement in gross margins in reflects a million increase in technology licensing and royalty fee revenues in our multimedia segment  which have minimal associated cost of revenue 
cost of technology licensing and service revenues from continuing operations  which consists entirely of cost of revenues generated by our multimedia segment  primarily includes direct engineering labor expenses  allocated overhead costs  costs associated with offshore contract labor costs  other direct costs related to the execution of technology development contracts and amortization of purchased intangible assets 
included in cost of technology licensing and service revenues in and is million and million  respectively  of amortization of purchased intangible assets 
also included in cost of technology  licensing and service revenues in and is million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
we believe that cost of technology  licensing and service revenues as a percentage of revenue for future periods will be affected by  among other things  sales volumes  competitive conditions  royalty payments by us on licensed technologies  changes in average selling prices  and our ability to make productivity improvements through continual cost reduction programs 
engineering  research and development the million increase in engineering  research and development expenses from continuing operations during is primarily attributable to our multimedia segment and is due to an increase in the costs of the ongoing development of multimedia software applications  media content management platforms and content delivery services  mainly through increased engineering headcount  including contractors 
included in engineering  research and development expenses in each of and is million of amortization of purchased intangible assets 
also included in engineering  research and development expenses in and is million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
we anticipate that engineering  research and development expenses from continuing operations will increase over the next twelve months from the ongoing development activities at our multimedia segment 
sales and marketing the million decrease in sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations during is primarily attributable to a million decrease in corporate marketing expenses resulting from the global restructuring initiative we implemented in the second half of  which included reductions in workforce and certain overhead and discretionary costs  offset by an million increase in sales and marketing expenses in our multimedia segment due primarily to the expansion of marketing efforts 
the compensation related costs incurred in relation to the employees terminated in connection with the restructuring are included in restructuring charges 
included in sales and marketing expenses in and is million and million  respectively  of amortization of purchased intangible assets 
also included in sales and marketing expenses in and is million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations will continue to decline over the next twelve months as we continue to implement cost reduction actions and business divestiture plans 
general and administrative the million decrease in general and administrative expenses from continuing operations during is primarily attributable to the corporate cost reductions resulting from the global restructuring initiative we implemented in the second half of  which included reductions in workforce and certain overhead and discretionary costs 
the compensation related costs incurred in relation to the employees terminated in connection with the restructuring are included in restructuring charges 
the decrease is also attributable to a decline in professional fees  due to a higher level of mergers and acquisition activity in  and lower employee recruitment expenses  offset by a million increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets  primarily wireless spectrum license assets resulting from the acquisition of additional wireless spectrum licenses in north america and europe during  and increased general and administrative expenses associated with the establishment of a shared services office in europe 
included in general and administrative expenses in and is million and million  respectively  of amortization of finite lived wireless spectrum licenses  and million and million  respectively  of amortization of purchased intangible assets 
also included in general and administrative expenses in and is million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses from continuing operations will continue to decline over the next twelve months as we continue to implement cost reduction actions and business divestiture plans 
restructuring charges in connection with the implementation of our global restructuring initiative  during  our continuing operations terminated employees worldwide and vacated four leased facilities 
as a result  we incurred million in employee termination costs  million in lease liability and related facility closure costs and million in other related costs  including contract termination costs  selling costs and legal fees 
we anticipate the continued implementation of our global restructuring initiative in will result in the termination of an additional employees and vacating additional leased facilities associated with our continuing operations 
accordingly  we will incur additional restructuring charges in the future as we continue to implement our global restructuring initiative 
asset impairment charges in connection with the implementation of our global restructuring initiative  we reviewed our long lived assets for impairment and determined that indicators of impairment were present for certain long lived assets utilized by our corporate administration functions 
we performed an impairment assessment of these assets and concluded that the carrying value of certain of the assets exceeded their fair value 
accordingly  during  we recognized an asset impairment charge of million 
we may incur additional asset impairment charges in the future as we continue to implement our global restructuring initiative 
purchased in process research and development purchased in process research and development in consisted entirely of the assigned value of the video and audio software for handsets development project purchased through our acquisition of sdc secure digital container ag sdc in january the value allocated to purchased in process research and development was based on projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses and was determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry 
the value of the purchased in process research and development from the sdc acquisition was expensed at the date of acquisition 
gain on sale of wireless spectrum licenses during the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of certain of our owned aws spectrum licenses in the united states to third parties for net proceeds  after deducting direct and incremental selling costs  of million  and recognized gains on these sales totaling million 
the net proceeds from the sale were used to redeem a portion of the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest 
interest income interest income from continuing operations for was million  as compared to million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily due to the decline in our unrestricted and restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by continuing operations during interest income in the future will be affected by changes in short term interest rates and changes in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  which may be materially impacted by divestitures and other financial activities 
interest expense interest expense from continuing operations for was million  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to million in consent fees paid during to withdraw the full million from the cash reserve account related to the senior notes  million in higher interest accretion of the debt discount and issuance costs related to our senior notes  including million representing the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to principal redeemed using the proceeds from the sales of wireless spectrum and million representing the premium paid upon redemption  million in interest and interest accretion of the debt discount and issuance costs related to our second lien notes and million in interest and interest accretion of the discount related to our third lien notes 
the remainder of the increase consists primarily of higher accretion of discounted wireless spectrum license lease liabilities acquired during and and interest on debt assumed and guaranteed by us in connection with our acquisitions during we anticipate that interest expense from continuing operations will continue to increase over the next twelve months as a result of our issuance of the second lien notes and third lien notes in october other income expense  net other expense  net  for was million  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in other expense  net is due primarily to the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives on our second lien notes and third lien notes issued in october provision for income taxes during  substantially all of our us subsidiaries generated taxable losses and  therefore  no material income tax provision or benefit was recognized for these subsidiaries 
however  certain of our controlled foreign corporations generated taxable income as a result of cost sharing and transfer pricing arrangements with our us subsidiaries in relation to research and development expenses incurred 
our effective income tax rate for continuing operations for was  resulting in a million income tax benefit on our pre tax loss of million 
the income tax benefit consists of a million benefit from the effect of the change in the effective income tax rate on the deferred tax liabilities associated with indefinite lived intangible assets  offset by million of income taxes related to our controlled foreign corporations and million for foreign withholding tax on royalty payments received from certain packetvideo customers 
the effective income tax rate for continuing operations for was  resulting in a million income tax provision in on our pre tax loss of million  which primarily relates to income taxes in foreign jurisdictions

business realignment credits during the period from inception april  to december  we accrued million related to minimum purchase obligations that we believed we would not utilize due to the then anticipated technology and market trial plans in henderson  nevada 
in the fourth quarter of  we renegotiated this minimum purchase obligation with the vendor and reversed the accrual to reflect the reduction in the contractual obligation 
loss on business divestitures loss on business divestitures relates to the losses realized upon our sale of ipwireless and the liquidation through bankruptcy of our network infrastructure businesses in israel  canada and denmark in the fourth quarter of the loss from the divestiture of these businesses consists of million of previously recognized asset impairment charges and million of previously recognized inventory write downs  offset by million from the deconsolidation of the remaining net liabilities of the divested businesses 
other income expense  net other income  net during was million  as compared to other expense  net of million for  an increase of million 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher net foreign currency exchange rate gains recognized during due to the strengthening of the value of the us dollar

minority interest minority interest from discontinued operations during represents the minority shareholders share of losses in cygnus 
we acquired the remaining minority ownership interest in cygnus in february liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations  business combinations  strategic investments and wireless spectrum license acquisitions primarily with the million in cash received in our initial capitalization in april  the net proceeds of million from the issuance of the senior notes in july  the net proceeds of million from our issuance of series a preferred stock in march and the net proceeds of million from our issuance of the second lien notes in october our total unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held by continuing operations totaled million at december  in an effort to reduce our future working capital requirements and in order to comply with the terms of our senior notes  second lien notes and third lien notes  in the second half of  we commenced the implementation of a global restructuring initiative  pursuant to which we have divested our network infrastructure businesses and wound down our semiconductor business and we are required to  among other things  pursue the sale of certain of our other businesses and assets  including our wireless spectrum licenses  and complete other cost reduction actions 
our senior notes  second lien notes and third lien notes require that the net proceeds from any sales or dispositions of assets be applied towards the repayment of the notes  rather than being used to fund our ongoing operations 
additionally  the senior notes and second lien notes require that we maintain a minimum cash balance of million minimum balance condition 
failure to comply with the minimum balance condition results in an immediate event of default 
on april   we obtained a waiver from the holders of our senior notes  second lien notes  and third lien notes that adjusts the minimum balance condition from million to million  waives certain events of default relating to timely delivery of a new operating budget  permits us to issue up to million of indebtedness on a pari passu basis with our second lien notes  and allows us to pay certain holders of our senior notes payment in kind interest at a rate of 
we have entered into a binding commitment letter with navation  inc  an entity controlled by allen salmasi  our chairman and chief executive officer  to provide up to million in working capital financing 
up to million of the obligation to provide working capital financing has been assigned to sola ltd  a holder of our second lien notes  third lien notes and common stock warrants 
the terms of the commitment letter provide that we will be entitled to borrow up to million in one or more borrowings after june   subject to conditions including the completion of definitive documentation 
amounts outstanding under the facility will bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable in kind  and will be secured by a first lien on certain working capital collateral and second lien on the assets securing our second lien notes  on a pari passu basis 
as a condition to such commitment we agreed to pay a commitment fee of  to navation  inc and  upon the initial borrowing under such facility  we will issue to the lenders thereunder warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the terms of the commitment letter also provide that mr 
salmasi will be nominated to serve an additional three year term as chairman of the board of directors  subject to stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders  and that navation  inc will have a right of first refusal to purchase the assets of our semiconductor business 
we believe that the completion of the asset divestiture and cost reduction actions contemplated by our global restructuring initiative  including the divestiture or shut down of our semiconductor business  our current cash and cash equivalents  projected revenues from our multimedia segment  our committed million working capital financing and our ability to elect payment in kind interest with respect to at least in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  coupled with the reduction to the minimum balance condition  will allow us to meet our estimated working capital requirements at least through december should we be unable to achieve the revenues and or cash flows for fiscal year contemplated in our operating plan  which was approved by the governance committee of our board of directors on march   we will implement certain additional actions to reduce our working capital requirements including staffing reductions  the deferral of capital expenditures associated with the build out requirements of our wireless spectrum licenses and reductions in foreign operations 
if we are unable to achieve the anticipated savings from the implementation of our global restructuring initiative  we are unable to consummate our working capital financing transaction  or if we were to incur significant unanticipated expenditures  we would be required to renegotiate our lending arrangements and we may also be required to seek additional debt and or equity financing and or further reduce discretionary spending 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
insufficient capital would significantly restrict our ability to operate and could cause us to seek relief through a filing in the u 
s bankruptcy court

significant investing activities in significant investing activities during by our continuing operations included the following during the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of certain of our owned aws spectrum licenses in the united states to third parties for net proceeds  after deducting direct and incremental selling costs  of million  and recognized gains on these sales totaling million 
the net proceeds from the sale were used to redeem a portion of the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest 
we paid million of additional purchase consideration to the selling shareholders of ipwireless as a result of the achievement of certain product shipment milestones in as specified in the acquisition agreement 
of the amount paid  million was paid in cash and million was paid through the issuance of approximately million net shares of our common stock 
additionally  million in cash was returned to us as a result of the settlement of our escrow claim in relation to the acquisition

after payment of transaction related fees and expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million to be used solely in connection with the ordinary course business operations and not for any acquisition of assets or businesses or other uses 
we also issued the third lien notes in an aggregate principal amount of million in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock 
we did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of the third lien notes 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of certain of our owned aws spectrum licenses in the united states to third parties for net proceeds  after deducting direct and incremental selling costs  of million 
the net proceeds from the sale were used to redeem a portion of the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest 
during  under the terms of the amended purchase agreement for the senior notes  we withdrew the full amount of the million cash reserve account established as collateral for the senior notes for use in funding our business plan 
in order to complete the withdrawal from the cash reserve account  we paid consent fees totaling million during in august  we entered into a non recourse loan with ubs under which we were advanced million 
the loan is collateralized by of the aggregate principal amount of our auction rate securities portfolio managed by ubs 
under the terms of the loan agreement  as our auction rate securities are sold  the line of credit will be immediately and automatically repaid using the proceeds from the sale 
the line of credit bears interest at the prevailing day libor rate plus basis points  which approximates the interest rate payable to us on our auction rate securities 
although the loan is payable upon demand by ubs  repayment can only occur through a liquidation of the underlying collateralized auction rate securities 
looking forward we anticipate our packetvideo subsidiary will need minimal future cash investments based on its projected revenues  which are subject to the risks discussed in this annual report under the heading risk factors 
our packetvideo subsidiary  which is reported in our multimedia segment  supplies multimedia software and server solutions to many of the world s largest wireless carriers and wireless handset manufacturers  who use it to transform a mobile phone into a feature rich multimedia device that provides people with the ability to stream  download and play video and music  receive live tv broadcasts  and engage in two way video telephony 
we have initiated several steps to minimize the future working capital needs  including divesting our ipwireless subsidiary  shutting down the operations of our other network infrastructure businesses  which comprise our networks segment  including the operations of our go networks and cygnus subsidiaries and our global services and nextwave network support strategic business units  and shutting down the operations of our semiconductor business 
additionally  we have initiated divestiture actions for our wimax telecom business  which is reported in our strategic initiatives segment  and consists of strategic investments in european wireless spectrum and wireless broadband network operations 
in addition to divesting and or discontinuing the business units and subsidiaries described above  we are in the process of seeking additional financing and implementing certain additional cost reduction activities as follows we entered into a binding commitment letter with navation  inc  an entity controlled by allen salmasi  our chairman and chief executive officer  to provide up to million in working capital financing 
our ability to access such funding remains subject to conditions including the completion of definitive documentation to the satisfaction of all parties 
as a condition to such commitment  we agreed to pay a commitment fee of  to navation  inc and  upon the initial borrowing under such facility  we will issue to the lenders thereunder warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
a re sizing of our corporate overhead functions to match the anticipated reduction in overall global support requirements  including our information technology  legal  finance  human resources and corporate branding and marketing functions 
integration of certain corporate administration functions into our packetvideo operations in san diego  california 
continued pursuit of wireless spectrum asset sales  which will reduce our outstanding indebtedness thereby reducing the interest costs payable in future years 
proceeds from the sale of our assets  including wireless spectrum and our office building in nevada  net of costs to sell  must be used to redeem our senior notes  second lien notes and third lien notes 
at december   the principal balance on our senior notes  due in july  our second lien notes  due in december and our third lien notes  due in december was million  million and million  respectively 
we will be required to successfully monetize most of our wireless spectrum assets in order to retire our debt 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to find third parties interested in purchasing our wireless spectrum assets at prices sufficient to retire this debt prior to maturity 
upon closing of the remainder of the previously announced sales of our aws spectrum licenses  we will realize a significant return on our original investment in these licenses 
however  there can be no assurance that we will realize a similar return upon the sale of our remaining wireless spectrum holdings 
while we have no material debt maturities prior to july  the united states credit markets are currently experiencing an unprecedented contraction 
as a result of the tightening credit markets  as well as our operating losses  we may not be able to refinance our existing debt at maturity on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to pay our debt at maturity  the holders of our notes could proceed against the assets pledged to secure these obligations  which include our spectrum assets and the capital stock of our material subsidiaries 
our long term operating success will depend on our ability to execute our cost reduction and divestiture programs in a timely manner  to obtain favorable cash flow from the continued growth and market penetration of our packetvideo subsidiary  and optimally executing our wireless spectrum sale program so as to meet debt payment requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
our accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we have derived revenues from the following sources contracts to provide multimedia software products for mobile and home electronic devices and related royalties through our packetvideo subsidiary  sales of wireless broadband and mobile broadcast network products and services by our ipwireless and go networks subsidiaries  which are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the wireless broadband and mobile broadcast network products sold by ipwireless and go networks often included embedded software  and customer subscriptions for the wimax network operated by our wimax telecom subsidiary  which is included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
for arrangements that do not contain software or embedded software that is incidental to the arrangement  we recognize revenue in accordance with the principles in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for software arrangements  or in cases where the software is considered more than incidental and is essential to the functionality of the hardware or the infrastructure products  revenue is recognized pursuant to american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  sop no 
 a modification of sop software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applicability of sop to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
we also consider the provisions of sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our revenue arrangements can include multiple deliverables  including hardware  a software or technology license  non recurring engineering services and post contract customer support 
for these arrangements  we consider the guidance provided by eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  we evaluate each deliverable in the arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists vendor specific objective evidence for all units of accounting in the arrangement  revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting or element based on those relative fair values 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  but not for delivered elements  the residual method would be used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
if elements cannot be treated as separate units of accounting because vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered elements does not exist  they are combined into a single unit of accounting and the associated revenue is deferred until all combined elements have been delivered or until there is only one remaining element to be delivered 
to date  we have not been able to establish vendor specific objective evidence for any of the elements included in our revenue arrangements  as the software and hardware products or services have not yet been sold separately  nor has a standard price list been established 
as a result  once the software or technology is delivered and the only undelivered element is services  the entire non contingent contract value is recognized ratably over the remaining service period 
costs directly attributable to providing these services are also deferred and amortized over the remaining service period of the respective revenues 
services sold separately are generally billed on a time and materials basis at agreed upon billing rates  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
we earn royalty revenues on licensed embedded multimedia products sold by our licensees 
generally  royalties are paid by licensees on a per unit or contingent usage basis 
the licensees generally report and pay the royalty in the quarter subsequent to the period of delivery or usage 
we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees 
when royalty arrangements also provide for ongoing post contract customer support that does not meet the criteria to be recognized upon delivery of the software  the royalty is recognized ratably from the date the royalty report is received through the stated remaining term of the post contract customer support 
in limited situations  we have determined that post contract customer support revenue can be recognized upon delivery of the software because the obligation to provide post contract customer support is for one year or less  the estimated cost of providing the post contract customer support during the arrangement is insignificant and unspecified upgrades or enhancements offered for the particular post contract customer support arrangement historically have been and are expected to continue to be minimal and infrequently provided 
in these instances  we have accrued all the estimated costs of providing the services upfront  which to date have been insignificant 
if we receive non refundable advanced payments from licensees that are allocable to future contracts periods or could be creditable against other obligations of the licensee to us  the recognition of the related revenue is deferred until such future periods or until such creditable obligations lapse 
in instances where we have noted extended payment terms  revenue is recognized in the period the payment becomes due 
if an arrangement includes specified upgrade rights  revenue is deferred until the specified upgrade has been delivered 
we do not generally allow for product returns and we have no history of significant product returns 
accordingly  no allowance for returns has been provided 
the timing and amount of revenue recognition depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that our management believes are reasonable 
wireless spectrum licenses we capitalize as intangible assets wireless spectrum licenses that we acquire from third parties or through government auctions 
for wireless spectrum licenses purchased directly from third parties or through spectrum auctions  the cost basis of the wireless spectrum asset includes the purchase price paid for the license at the time of acquisition plus legal costs incurred to acquire the license 
for wireless spectrum licenses acquired through a business combination or through the acquisition of a business where the assets of the business are comprised almost entirely of wireless spectrum  the cost basis of the wireless spectrum asset is determined through an allocation of the total purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired business or asset s and includes any deferred tax liabilities determined in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for acquired temporary differences in certain purchase transactions that are not accounted for as business combinations 
for leased wireless spectrum rights  the asset and related liability are recorded at the net present value of future cash outflows using our incremental borrowing rate at the time of acquisition 
we have determined that certain of our wireless spectrum licenses meet the definition of indefinite lived intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  because the licenses are either perpetual or may be renewed periodically for a nominal fee  provided that we continue to meet the service and geographic coverage provisions 
moreover  we have determined that there are currently no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of these wireless spectrum licenses 
as of december   indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses that are not subject to amortization totaled million  of which million has been classified as held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
wireless spectrum licenses for which we have acquired lease rights from third parties are considered to have finite lives 
the wireless license asset is then amortized over the contractual life of the lease 
we have also acquired the rights to wireless spectrum licenses in europe where the renewal terms are not yet well established 
we amortize these assets on a straight line basis over the initial license period 
amortization expense on wireless spectrum licenses is charged to general and administrative expense 
as of december   amortized wireless spectrum licenses  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million  of which million has been classified as held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
during the year ended december   our wireless spectrum licenses  net decreased by million  which was primarily due to the sale of aws spectrum licenses with a cost basis of million  a million impairment of our wireless spectrum licenses in argentina and chile  million of amortization expense and million due to the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates and other items  offset by wireless spectrum license acquisitions of million 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual review for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we test goodwill for impairment annually on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter at a reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determined that our reporting units  as that term is defined in sfas no 
 are one level below our identified operating segments because discrete financial information is available 
we primarily determine fair value under an income approach that utilizes a discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows 
a weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate 
the residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period 
alternatively  the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period 
at october  the substantial majority of our goodwill of continuing operations primarily resided in our packetvideo reporting unit 
for our annual impairment assessment  the discounted cash flows used to estimate fair value of the packetvideo reporting unit were based on discrete financial forecasts of future operating results over the upcoming five years that were developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond these periods were estimated using a terminal growth rate of 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
based on the analysis  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
we cannot assure you that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows will materialize as estimated 
for example  if our projections of unit sales growth and increased market penetration of mobile subscriber services by packetvideo s customer base do not materialize  the fair value of our packetvideo reporting unit may fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete future reviews of our goodwill for impairment that a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the discount rate combined and basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would not have caused the fair value of the packetvideo reporting unit to fall below its carrying value 
as a result of the implementation of our global restructuring initiative in the third quarter of  we reviewed our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment and determined that indicators of impairment were present for the goodwill in our ipwireless and cygnus reporting units  both of which are presented as discontinued operations 
accordingly  we performed a goodwill impairment assessment as prescribed by sfas no 
and concluded that the carrying value of the reporting units exceeded their fair value 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recognized an asset impairment charge of million  representing the full carrying amount of the goodwill in our ipwireless and cygnus reporting units which was our estimate of the impairment based on information available at that time 
we performed our annual impairment assessment for the goodwill of our ipwireless and cygnus reporting units as of october as described in note  in december  we sold a controlling interest in our ipwireless subsidiary for an upfront cash payment of approximately million 
we determined the fair value of our ipwireless reporting unit based on the cash proceeds received and liabilities assumed in the sale and concluded that the carrying value of the ipwireless reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 we compared the implied fair value of the ipwireless reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill and concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the amount of the resulting asset impairment charge of million did not change from our initial estimate in the third quarter of upon the sale of ipwireless in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified the ipwireless goodwill asset impairment charge against the loss from business divestiture reported in discontinued operations 
we began actively marketing our cygnus reporting unit for sale in the third quarter of although we participated in preliminary sale and or licensing discussions involving the cygnus intellectual property and operations  none of those discussions advanced and our efforts to sell cygnus were ultimately unsuccessful 
as a result  cygnus was shut down and the remaining employees were terminated in early october since we do not anticipate generating significant future cash flows from the divestiture of the cygnus reporting unit  we determined that the fair value of the cygnus reporting unit was nominal 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 we compared the implied fair value of the cygnus reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill and concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the amount of the resulting asset impairment charge of million did not change from our initial estimate in the third quarter of upon the deconsolidation of our cygnus canada subsidiary in the fourth quarter of as a result of the acceptance of the bankruptcy petition  we reclassified million of the asset impairment charge representing the goodwill of cygnus canada against the loss from business divestiture reported in discontinued operations 
valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not amortize indefinite lived intangible assets 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual review for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
indefinite lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter by making a determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we also evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not subject to amortization on an annual basis to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  that asset is tested for impairment 
after recognition of the impairment  if any  the asset is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
for purposes of performing our annual impairment assessment of indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses  we have segregated our indefinite lived intangible wireless spectrum licenses into separate units of accounting using the guidance provided by eitf issue no 
 unit of accounting for testing of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  based on the type of spectrum and location 
we determined the fair value of our wireless spectrum licenses utilizing both a market approach and an income approach 
under the market approach  we determined fair value through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets  including the sales of our aws licenses during and fcc auctions of similar wireless spectrum 
sales and offering prices for the comparable assets are adjusted to reflect differences between our wireless spectrum licenses and the comparable assets  such as location  time and terms of sale  use and utility  trends in technology and consumer demand  and regulatory issues  that may potentially affect the value of our wireless spectrum 
under the income approach  we determined fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow model which measures fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the asset and achieving the projected cash flows 
a weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate 
the residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period 
the projected cash flows  market penetration rate  terminal growth rate and weighted average cost of capital used in the model assume a new entrant in the market and the associated network build out requirements 
the discounted cash flow model assumed a discount rate of  which represents the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant plus an additional discount for risks specific to our domestic wireless spectrum  and a terminal growth rate of 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the discount rate  basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate and year delay in the commencement of network build out and customer intake would not have caused the fair value of our indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses to fall below their carrying value 
of our indefinite lived wireless spectrum licenses at december   million represent the carrying value of domestic wcs spectrum licenses 
wireless devices utilizing wcs spectrum are currently susceptible to interference from sdars 
the fcc is considering a proposal to permanently authorize terrestrial repeaters for sdars operations adjacent to the c and d blocks of the wcs band 
permanently authorizing sdars repeaters adjacent to the wcs band could cause interference to wcs  brs and ebs receivers although the extent of the interference from sdars repeaters is unclear 
in our determination of the fair value of our wcs spectrum licenses  we assumed a favorable outcome to this matter as we believe is the most reasonably likely result of the fcc proceedings 
were we to receive an unfavorable ruling from the fcc  the fair value of our wcs spectrum licenses would be negatively impacted and there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover their carrying value 
based on the impairment assessment performed in october  we determined that the carrying value of our wireless spectrum licenses in argentina and chile exceeded their fair value  based primarily on advanced negotiations with third parties regarding the sale of these assets 
accordingly  we wrote down the carrying value of our argentina and chile wireless spectrum licenses to their estimated fair value and recognized an asset impairment charge of million which is reported in discontinued operations 
other than the wireless spectrum licenses in argentina and chile  we concluded that our remaining wireless spectrum licenses were not impaired 
as a result of the impairment of our wireless spectrum licenses in argentina  we reduced the associated deferred tax liabilities determined in accordance with eitf issue no 
on a pro rata basis resulting in the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit of million  which is reported in discontinued operations 
accordingly  the net impact to loss from discontinued operations of the impairment of our wireless spectrum licenses in argentina and chile was million 
at december   the aggregate carrying value of our other indefinite lived intangible assets held by continuing operations  which consist of purchased tradenames and trademarks  was million 
for our annual impairment assessment of other indefinite lived intangible assets  we primarily determined fair value under an income approach that utilizes a discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flows used to estimate fair value were based on discrete financial forecasts of five years future operating results over the upcoming five years that were developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond these periods were estimated using a terminal growth rate of 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
based on this analysis  we concluded that our other indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
a long lived asset is considered to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
in connection with the implementation of our global restructuring initiative  we reviewed our long lived assets for impairment and determined that indicators of impairment were present for the long lived assets in our networks and semiconductor segments as well as certain other long lived assets 
accordingly  based on the guidance provided by sfas no 
 we performed an assessment to determine if the carrying value of these long lived assets was recoverable through estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
included in the long lived assets of our networks segment  which is included in discontinued operations  is an office building we own in nevada that we are actively marketing for sale through a national brokerage firm 
in june  we classified the building as an asset held for sale and ceased depreciating this asset 
for the long lived asset recoverability assessment performed during  the undiscounted cash flows used to estimate the recoverability of the asset carrying values were based on the estimated future net cash flows to be generated from the sale or licensing of the assets  less estimated costs to sell 
based on the analysis  we concluded that the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets was not recoverable 
the impaired assets primarily consist of the amortizable purchased intangible assets of our ipwireless  go networks and cygnus businesses  our nevada office building and the equipment contained therein  and leasehold improvements and fixed assets at vacated facilities 
accordingly  during  we recognized an asset impairment charge of million  of which million was reclassified against the loss from business divestiture reported in discontinued operations  million is reported as an asset impairment charge in discontinued operations and million is reported as an asset impairment charge in continuing operations 
there are inherent estimates and assumptions underlying the projected cash flows utilized in the recoverability assessment and management s judgment is required in the application of this information to the determination of the recovery value of the assets 
no assurance can be given that the underlying estimates and assumptions will materialize as anticipated 
valuation of share based awards we account for the grant of employee share based awards under provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas no 
r 
accordingly  we estimate the fair value of our share based stock awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain input variables  as follows expected volatility 
volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award 
we determine expected volatility based primarily on our historical stock price volatility 
risk free interest rate 
our assumption of the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us constant rate treasury securities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the share based award 
expected dividend yield 
because we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  we assume a dividend yield of zero 
expected award life 
we determine the expected award life based on our historical experience and the expected award lives applied by certain of our peer companies to determine the expected life of each grant 
under sfas no 
r  we are also required to estimate at the grant date the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre vesting forfeiture rate  and revise the estimate  if necessary  in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs 
we determine the pre vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on industry and employee turnover data as well as an historical pre vesting forfeitures occurring over the previous year 
under the true up provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize additional share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and a recovery of previously recognized share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated 
we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas no 
r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes option pricing model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and the sab no 
 share based payment  using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer and willing seller market transaction 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods than those currently applied  the share based compensation expense that we recognize in the future may differ significantly from what we have reported historically 
fair value measurements we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  in the first quarter of we account for the fair value measurements of the applicable assets and liabilities under provisions of sfas no 
and  accordingly  we assess the inputs of those fair value measurements based on the fair value hierarchy as described in sfas no 
for each of the major categories of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
the following summarizes the assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis and the assets and liabilities that we measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the period and their respective input levels based on the fair value hierarchy 
auction rate securities 
with the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  auction rate securities have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders  and as a result  our auction rate securities are currently not liquid 
accordingly  at december   we estimated the fair value of our auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model level inputs  which measures fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific period 
the values are then discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in the security and achieving the projected cash flows 
the discounted cash flow model used to determine the fair value of the auction rate securities utilized a discount rate of  which represents an estimated market rate of return  and an estimated period until sale and or successful auction of the security of years 
the determination of the fair value of our auction rate securities also considered  among other things  the collateralization underlying the individual securities and the creditworthiness of the counterparty 
the discounted cash flow model used to measure the fair value of our auction rate securities is sensitive to fluctuations in the discount rate and estimated recover period assumptions 
for instance  a basis point fluctuation in the discount rate would result in an approximately million change in fair value  and a year fluctuation in the recovery period would result in an approximately million change in fair value 
auction rate securities rights 
our auction rate securities rights allow us to sell our auction rate securities at par value to ubs at any time during the period of june  through july  we have elected to measure the fair value of the auction rate securities rights under sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which we believe will mitigate volatility in our reported earnings due to the inverse relationship between the fair value of the auction rate securities rights and the underlying auction rate securities 
at december   we estimated the fair value of our auction rate securities rights using a discounted cash flow model  similar to the auction rate securities level inputs 
the discounted cash flow model utilized a discount rate of and an estimated period until recovery of years  which represents the period until the earliest date that we can exercise our auction rate securities rights 
embedded derivatives 
our obligation to redeem the second lien notes and third lien notes upon an asset sale and a change in control constitute embedded derivatives under sfas no 
accordingly  we have bifurcated the estimated fair value of each embedded derivative from the fair value of the second lien notes and third lien notes upon issuance  and recognized subsequent changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives against income 
we measured the estimated fair value of the second lien notes and third lien notes embedded derivatives using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flow model utilizes management assumptions of the probability of occurrence of a redemption of the second lien notes and third lien notes upon an asset sale and a change in control which are unobservable inputs 
we also had obligations to pay contingent cash dividends and cash premiums upon redemption or liquidation of the series a preferred stock which also constituted embedded derivatives under sfas no 
through the date that we exchanged the series a preferred stock for the third lien notes  we measured the fair values of these derivatives at each reporting date and any changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative were recorded as a charge to other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
the embedded derivatives in the series a preferred stock were not traded on a public exchange 
accordingly  we determined the fair value of the series a preferred stock embedded derivatives utilizing a binomial lattice pricing model 
certain of the inputs in the model are observable inputs such as the yield rate  risk free rate  credit spread  stock price and stock price volatility 
however  the model also utilizes significant inputs related to the likelihood of the occurrence of certain events triggering redemption that are unobservable and are based upon management s estimates level inputs 
third lien notes 
in october  we issued the third lien notes in the aggregate principal amount of million in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock 
we did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of the third lien notes 
at issuance  we measured the third lien notes at their estimated fair value of using a discounted cash flow model level inputs 
the discounted cash flow model used to determine the fair value of the third lien notes utilized a discount rate of  which represents the incremental borrowing rate on our second lien notes  including the value assigned to the detachable stock warrants and the consent fees paid to the purchasers of the second lien notes which were deducted from the proceeds 
litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
other than an accrual for the potential loss related to a complaint filed by arden realty limited partnership arden  described below  we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with our current legal proceedings based on our belief that a liability  while possible  is not probable

income taxes in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we apply a recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
requires that we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of december  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our cash contractual obligations for continuing and discontinued operations at december  as well as significant cash contractual obligations entered into subsequent to that date  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands total years years years and thereafter continuing operations long term obligations services and other purchase agreements operating leases accrued purchase consideration payable in cash discontinued operations long term obligations services and other purchase agreements operating leases total amounts presented do not include cash interest payments on the senior notes or the issuance of additional second lien notes and third lien notes in payment of interest 
for the purposes of the contractual obligations table  we have classified million of the remaining unpaid principal balance of the senior notes as due in  representing the carrying value of our wireless spectrum licenses that are classified as held for sale at december  we have assumed that the remaining principal balance of the senior notes as well as the second lien notes and third lien notes will not be repaid until their respective maturity dates 
in addition to amounts payable in cash  we have accrued for million at december   in additional purchase consideration payable through the issuance of shares of our common stock to the selling shareholders of ipwireless as a result of the achievement of certain revenue milestones in as specified in the acquisition agreement 
the actual number of shares to be issued will be based on the average closing price of our common stock for the consecutive trading days ending with the third trading day immediately preceding the actual payment date 
we anticipate that the substantial majority of the amount due will be paid in off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we have entered into a binding commitment letter with navation  inc  an entity controlled by allen salmasi  our chairman and chief executive officer  to provide up to million in working capital financing 
our ability to access such funding remains subject to conditions including the completion of definitive documentation to the satisfaction of all parties 
as a condition to such commitment we agreed to pay a commitment fee of  to navation  inc and  upon the initial borrowing under such facility  we will issue to the lenders thereunder warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on december   we sold a controlling interest in our ipwireless subsidiary to ipw holdings  inc ipw holdings and an affiliate of ipw holdings  for an upfront cash payment of approximately million  plus future cash payments of up to million for reimbursement of transaction related expenses

affiliates of avenue capital also participated in the issuance of our senior notes in july recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position apb accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
fsp apb requires the initial proceeds from convertible debt that may be settled in cash to be bifurcated between a liability component and an equity component 
the objective of the guidance is to require the liability and equity components of convertible debt to be separately accounted for in a manner such that the interest expense recorded on the convertible debt would not equal the contractual rate of interest on the convertible debt  but instead would be recorded at a rate that would reflect the issuer s conventional non convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance 
this is accomplished through the creation of a discount on the debt that would be accreted using the effective interest method as additional non cash interest expense over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding 
the provisions of fsp apb will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements of our adoption fsp apb on our third lien notes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   our investment portfolios held by continuing and discontinued operations included unrestricted and restricted cash and investment securities with fair values of million and million  respectively 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
interest income earned on our investments is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates eg to would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency risk in addition to our us operations  we conduct business through international subsidiaries  primarily located in europe and asia 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly fluctuations in the euro  swiss franc and japanese yen exchange rates 
additionally  a portion of our sales to customers located in foreign countries  specifically certain sales by our packetvideo subsidiary  are denominated in euros  which subjects us to foreign currency risks related to those transactions 
we analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to reduce the effect of these potential fluctuations 
we do not currently have hedging contracts in effect 
other market risk at december   we held auction rate securities with an aggregate carrying value of million 
with the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  auction rate securities have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders  and as a result  we have been unable to liquidate our remaining auction rate securities and these securities are subject to declines in fair value as a result of their current illiquidity 
to date  we have recognized other than temporary impairment losses of million representing our estimate of the decline in the fair value of our auction rate securities through december  the risk associated with the illiquidity of our auction rate securities is mitigated by our participation in ubs s auction securities rights offering  which allow us to sell our auction rate securities at par value to ubs at any time during the period of june  through july
