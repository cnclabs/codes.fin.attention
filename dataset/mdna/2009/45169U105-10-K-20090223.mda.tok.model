critical accounting policies and estimates the following explains our most critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth on pages to of this form k for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on time and material contracts as the services are performed 
time and material contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate 
a price for an entire project is agreed upon for a predetermined fee before the project starts 
we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
we prepare a budget for each fixed price project  and based upon the budget that we prepare  we estimate what our costs should be 
we determine performance by comparing the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
we recognize revenue based upon costs incurred by our consultants during the period 
the company follows this revenue recognition method for fixed price contracts because there is a direct and consistent relationship between the service patterns and services provided to the customer and the direct costs incurred to provide such services 
if our cost estimates indicate a loss on a particular fixed price contract  we record a provision for the estimated loss without regard to the stage of completion 
changes in job performance  conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the changes are identified 
certain contracts with no stated deliverables  with a designated workforce assigned  we recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
revenue on these contracts is ratable and predetermined based upon the negotiated contract 
we also bill customers based on a transaction fee basis 
revenue from these unit prices contracts are recognized on rendering of the services as per the terms of the contract 
investments in unconsolidated entities investments in equity shares of unconsolidated entities that are not quoted or publicly traded in which the company owns less than of the voting interest are accounted for at cost 
for investments in entities in which the company owns between and of the voting interest or otherwise acquires management influence are accounted for using the equity method and initially recognized at cost 
under the equity method  the company s share of the post acquisition profits and losses is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements  etc 
in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs all quantitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
in evaluating these factors above  management presumes a decline in value to be other than temporary if the fair value of the security is or more below the investment s carrying value for a period of six months or more the criteria 
however  the presumption of an other than temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature eg  strong operating performance of investee  historical volatility of investee  etc additionally  there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the criterion is not satisfied eg  plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below the company s carrying basis 
in  the company recorded an impairment of its remaining investment in concours  inc of million 
there were no impairments recorded in or in allowance for uncollectible accounts accounts receivables are reviewed periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible  as well as judgments made by the company based upon historical and expected collection experience 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators arise 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon the company s market capitalization and the discounted future cash flow analysis 
these cash flow projections are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment  if indicators of impairment arise 
the evaluation of impairment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is considered impaired 
the impairment expense is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
amortization of the company s definite lived intangible assets is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
income taxes in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes  we make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or charge will result 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax 
table of contents planning strategies  including reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax holiday periods in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  we make an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  which would be reflected as income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we reverse the valuation allowance which would be reflected as an income tax benefit or as an adjustment to stockholders equity for tax assets related to stock options 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at entities or units that have been unprofitable and where we believe that such assets may not be utilized in the near term 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company purchases forward foreign exchange contracts option contracts derivatives to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on accounts receivable and forecasted cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies 
the company designates derivative contracts as cash flow hedges if they satisfy the criteria for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income losses  net of taxes until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income included in other income expense  net 
changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in other income expense  net 
with respect to derivatives designated as hedges  the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
the company also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
if it is determined that a derivative or a portion thereof is not highly effective as a hedge  or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  the company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting with respect to that derivative 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative is retained  the company continues to carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet and recognizes any subsequent change in its fair value in the consolidated statement of income 
when it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  the company discontinues hedge accounting and recognizes immediately in the consolidated statement of income the gains and losses attributable to such derivative that were accumulated in other comprehensive income 
stock based compensation effective january  we adopted revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock options at grant date based 
table of contents on the historical traded prices of our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other data including life of the option and vesting period 
the risk free interest rate assumption is the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements in and thereafter was based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the amount of stock based compensation expense in and thereafter was reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ significantly from those estimated 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock based awards on a periodic basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of property and equipment  carrying amount of property and equipment  intangibles and goodwill  valuation allowance for receivables and deferred tax assets  valuation of derivative instruments  valuation of share based compensation  assets and obligations related to employee benefits  income tax uncertainties and other contingencies and commitments 
management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable 
although these estimates are based upon management s best knowledge of current events and actions  actual results could differ from these estimates

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors we are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  especially the indian rupee rupee 
our exchange rate risk arises from our foreign currency revenues  receivables and payables 
we have sought to reduce the effect of any currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange options to cover a portion of our expected cash flows 
these instruments typically have maturities of one to three years 
we use these instruments as economic hedges and not for speculative purposes and they qualify for hedge accounting under sfas we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity the company s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation mainly between the rupee and the us dollar the usd 
this foreign currency risk exists based upon the nature of the company s operations 
the majority of the company s customers and revenue are us based  which provides an inherent foreign currency risk between usd and rupee exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing rupee rates mainly through financial market transactions 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on inter company transactions and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all of these transactions meet the criteria for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we designate contracts as cash flow hedges if they satisfy the criteria for hedge accounting under sfas changes in the fair value of these hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income losses  until the hedged transaction occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
changes in fair value for the ineffective portion of hedging instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of income of each period and are included in other income expense  net 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedge items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions with respect to derivatives designated as hedges 
in addition  we formally assess both at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
if it is determined that a derivative or a portion thereof is not highly effective as a hedge  or if a derivative ceases to be highly effective hedge  we will prospectively discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative is retained  we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet and recognize any subsequent change in its fair value in the consolidated statement of income 
when it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  we discontinue the hedge accounting and recognize immediately in the consolidated statement of income the gains and losses attributable to such derivative that were accumulated in other comprehensive income
