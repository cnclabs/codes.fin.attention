item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the realization of which may be impacted by certain important factors including  but not limited to  those risk factors disclosed pursuant to part  item a 
introduction and overview powerwave is a global supplier of end to end wireless solutions for wireless communications networks 
our business consists of the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of products to improve coverage  capacity and data speed in wireless communication networks  including antennas  boosters  combiners  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  remote radio head transceivers  repeaters  tower mounted amplifiers and advanced coverage solutions 
these products are utilized in major wireless networks throughout the world that support voice and data communications by use of cell phones and other wireless communication devices 
we sell such products to both original equipment manufacturers  who incorporate our products into their proprietary base stations which they then sell to wireless network operators  and directly to individual wireless network operators for deployment into their existing networks 
during the last eight years  demand for wireless communications infrastructure equipment has fluctuated dramatically 
while demand for wireless infrastructure was strong during  it weakened for powerwave during and due to significant reductions at three major customers  as well as a general slowdown in overall demand within the wireless infrastructure industry 
for the first three quarters of  demand once again increased 
in the fourth quarter of  demand for our products was negatively impacted by the global economic crisis 
we anticipate that the global credit crisis and economic recession that began in the fall of will lead to reduced capital spending and lower demand for our products in the near term 
this will likely negatively impact our financial results in the near term 
during  we undertook several cost cutting initiatives aimed at lowering our operating expenses 
these initiatives will continue and we may be required to further reduce operating expenses if there is a significant or prolonged reduction in spending by our customers 
in the past there have been significant slowdowns in capital spending by wireless network operators due to delays in the expected deployment of infrastructure equipment and financial difficulties on the part of the wireless network operators who were forced to consolidate and reduce spending to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their profitability 
economic conditions  such as the turmoil in the global equity and credit markets  as well as the global recession  and the rise of inflationary pressures related to rising commodity prices  have also had a negative impact on capital spending by wireless network operators  and will likely have a negative impact going forward in the near term 
all of these factors can have a significant negative impact on overall demand for wireless infrastructure products  and at various times  have directly reduced demand for our products and increased price competition within our industry which has in the past led to reductions in our revenues and contributed to our reported operating losses 
during fiscal and  we experienced a significant slowdown in demand from one of our direct network operator customers  at t  as well as reduced demand from several of our original equipment manufacturing customers  including nokia siemens and nortel networks  all of which combined directly reduced demand for our products and contributed to our operating losses for both fiscal and we believe that we have maintained our overall market share within the wireless communications infrastructure equipment market during this period of changing demand for wireless communication infrastructure equipment 
we continue to invest in the research and development of wireless communications network technology and the diversification of our product offerings  and we believe that we have one of our industry s leading product portfolios in terms of performance and features 
we believe that our proprietary design technology is a further differentiator for our products 
looking back over the last several years  beginning in fiscal we focused on cost savings while we expanded our market opportunities  as evidenced by our acquisition of lgp allgon 
this acquisition involved the integration of two companies based in different countries that previously operated independently  which was a complex  costly and time consuming process 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on cost savings while we expanded our market opportunities  as evidenced by our acquisition of selected assets and liabilities of remec  inc s wireless systems business the remec wireless acquisition 
we believe that this acquisition further strengthened our position in the global wireless infrastructure market 
in october  we completed the filtronic wireless acquisition 
we believe that this strategic acquisition provided us with the leading position in transmit and receive filter products  as well as broadening our rf conditioning and base station solutions product portfolio and added significant additional technology to our intellectual property portfolio 
for fiscal years and  we have focused on finalizing and implementing our plans to integrate this acquisition  consolidate operations and reduce our overall cost structure 
during this same time  we encountered a significant unanticipated reduction in revenues  which caused us to revise our integration and consolidation plans with a goal of further reducing our operating costs and significantly lowering our breakeven operating structure 
as has been demonstrated during the last four years  these acquisitions do not provide any guarantee that our revenues will increase 
as we leave and enter  we have a number of ongoing restructuring activities which are aimed at further reducing our overall operating cost structure and positioning us to return to profitability 

table of contents we measure our success by monitoring our net sales by product and consolidated gross margins  with a short term goal of maintaining a positive operating cash flow while striving to achieve long term operating profits 
we believe that there continues to be long term growth opportunities within the wireless communications infrastructure marketplace  and we are focused on positioning powerwave to benefit from these long term opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information currently available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the critical accounting policies that we believe are the most significant for purposes of fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is derived from the sales of products 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or delivery and passage of title depending upon the terms of the sale 
we offer certain of our customers the right to return products within a limited time after delivery under specified circumstances  generally related to product defects 
we monitor and track such product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product returns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are highly concentrated in a small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost determined on an average cost basis or fair market value and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to estimated net realizable value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare those requirements with the current or committed inventory levels 
depending on the product line and other factors  provisions are established based on historical usage for the preceding twelve months  adjusted for known changes in demands for such products  or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these provisions reduce the cost basis of the respective inventory and are recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
as demonstrated during the past seven fiscal years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional charges in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time such inventory is sold 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a material effect on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year 
the income tax provision benefit is computed on the pretax income loss of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction based 
table of contents on current tax law 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial accounting and tax reporting purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent we cannot determine that the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
realization of deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors  including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and or tax planning strategies 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of our cumulative federal and state net operating losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of our gross deferred tax assets 
for the foreseeable future  the federal tax provision related to future earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not be offset by a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  current and future tax expense will consist primarily of certain required state income taxes and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
acquired tax liabilities related to prior tax returns of acquired entities at the date of purchase are recognized based on our estimate of the ultimate settlement that may be accepted by the tax authorities 
we continually evaluate these tax related matters 
at the date of any material change in our estimate of items relating to an acquired entity s prior tax returns  and at the date that the items are settled with the tax authorities  any liabilities previously recognized are adjusted to increase or decrease the remaining balance of goodwill attributable to that acquisition 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas fin  clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the provisions of fin and have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal  state and foreign jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns for all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
the periods subject to examination for our us federal return are the through tax years  including adjustments to net operating loss and credit carryovers to those years 
in addition  we have subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitation generally ranging from to years 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  with any excess purchase price over fair value recorded as goodwill 
because of the expertise required to value intangible assets and in process research and development  we typically engage third party valuation specialists to assist us in determining those values 
valuation of intangible assets and in process research and development entails significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  determining the timing and expected costs to complete development projects  estimating future cash flows from product sales  developing appropriate discount rates  estimating probability rates for the successful completion of development projects  continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts  and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment of goodwill has possibly occurred 
the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based upon a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to the accounting value of the underlying net assets of such reporting unit 
to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  we utilize subjective valuations for the reporting unit based upon a discounted cash flow analysis as well as quoted market prices of our common stock plus an estimated market premium based upon companies with similar market transactions 
the discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon a number of various factors including estimates of forecasted revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
if the forecast assumptions utilized materially change  it could result in a lower fair value calculation which could require an impairment of existing goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the underlying net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill is less than the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all its underlying identifiable assets and liabilities 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill and million related to the impairment of our intangible assets 
see further discussion of this charge in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under part ii
