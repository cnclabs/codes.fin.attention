our mission is to become a leading company in the it staffing services industry in the united states 
we intend to pursue this mission through a combination of internal growth and strategic acquisitions that complement or enhance our business 

table of contents industry trends that affect our business include rate of technological change  rate of growth in corporate it and professional services budgets  penetration of it and professional services staffing in the general workforce  outsourcing of the it and professional services workforce  and consolidation of supplier bases 
we anticipate our growth will be primarily generated from greater penetration of our service offerings with our current clients  introducing new service offerings to our customers and obtaining new clients 
our strategy for achieving this growth includes cross selling our vendor management services  project solutions services and process solutions services to existing it staffing customers  aggressively marketing our services to new clients  expanding our range of value added services  enhancing brand recognition and making strategic acquisitions 
the success of our business depends primarily on the volume of assignments we secure  the bill rates for those assignments  the costs of the consultants that provide the services and the quality and efficiency of our recruiting  sales and marketing and administrative functions 
our experienced  tenured workforce  our proven track record  our recruiting and candidate screening processes  our strong account management team and our efficient and consistent administrative processes are factors that we believe are key to the success of our business 
factors outside of our control  such as the demand for it and other professional services  general economic conditions and the supply of qualified professionals  will also affect our success 
our revenue is primarily driven by bill rates and billable hours 
most of our billings for our staffing and project solutions services are on a time and materials basis  which means we bill our customers based on pre agreed bill rates for the number of hours that each of our consultants works on an assignment 
hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications 
general economic conditions  macro it and profession service expenditure trends and competition may create pressure on our pricing 
increasingly  large customers  including those with preferred supplier arrangements  have been seeking pricing discounts in exchange for higher volumes of business or maintaining existing levels of business 
billable hours are affected by numerous factors  such as the quality and scope of our service offerings and competition at the national and local levels 
we also generate fee income by providing vendor management and permanent placement services 
our principal operating expenses are cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of services is comprised primarily of the costs of consultant labor  including employees  subcontractors and independent contractors  and related employee benefits 
approximately of our consultants are employees and the remainder are subcontractors and independent contractors 
we compensate most of our consultants only for the hours that we bill to our clients  which allows us to better match our labor costs with our revenue generation 
with respect to our consultant employees  we are responsible for employment related taxes  medical and health care costs and workers compensation 
labor costs are sensitive to shifts in the supply and demand of professionals  as well as increases in the costs of benefits and taxes 
the principal components of selling  general and administrative expenses are salaries  selling and recruiting commissions  advertising  lead generation and other marketing costs and branch office expenses 
our branch office network allows us to leverage certain selling  general and administrative expenses  such as advertising and back office functions 
our back office functions  including payroll  billing  accounts payable  collections and financial reporting  are consolidated in our customer service center in phoenix  arizona  which operates on a peoplesoft platform 
we also have a proprietary  web enabled front office system that facilitates the identification  qualification and placement of consultants in a timely manner 
we maintain a national recruiting center  a centralized call center for scheduling sales appointments and a centralized proposals and contract services department 
we believe this scalable infrastructure allows us to provide high quality service to our customers and will facilitate our internal growth strategy and allow us to continue to integrate acquisitions rapidly 
our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to december st 
therefore  the fiscal year ends for  and were december   december   and december   respectively 
overview of results our stated priorities for were internal growth  efficiency improvements  further debt reductions and improved working capital management and expansion of our operations through acquisitions 
we made the following progress against each during the year 

table of contents our revenues declined in from we ended the year with  billable consultants  which was down over from the end of the decline was broad based across our business with no one client or industry driving this trend 
as the global economy worsened during  we experienced larger than normal bill rate pressures from several clients  and  although we attempt to mitigate the impact by adjusting the pay rates of our consultants  we are experiencing pressure on gross margins 
as a result  average bill rates in decreased slightly from rates 
our focus on sales  marketing and recruiting efforts to our core customers and on adding new customers has helped as certain sectors have had difficulties 
we have seen growth at both existing customers  as well as new clients  and we have continued to expand our middle market base 
we continued to see the benefits of our efficiency improvements throughout  and these improvements allowed us to redirect resources closer to the point of sale 
as part of our continuing efforts to focus on operational efficiencies and process improvements  we have consolidated certain administrative functions into the new phoenix customer service center 
this restructuring was a continuation of our plan to centralize certain operations to enhance our customer service and improve our internal processes 
due to our ability to generate cash from operations and improved working capital management  our net debt balance declined to million at the end of from million at the end of during  we generated million of cash flow from operations and used million for acquisitions 
our final priority was to expand our operations through selected acquisitions 
during  we completed the acquisition of aset  which allowed us to expand our existing globalization practice and complement our traditional staffing and consulting service offerings 
we recorded a non cash  goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of the impairment was the result of the decline in our trading stock price during the fourth quarter due to current market conditions 
neither our current operating trends nor our financial results for the fourth quarter were factors that led to the charge 
the non cash charge has no impact on our existing cash balances  working capital  debt balances  revolver availability or normal business operations 
despite the challenging environment in  we remained profitable throughout the year  when excluding the goodwill impairment charge 
additionally  we reduced our net debt further during the year  resulting in a decrease in our annual net interest expense 
priorities current economic uncertainty is making it more difficult to predict our progress towards the financial goals that have been established by management 
we believe that the current economic conditions limit our ability to provide meaningful guidance for the ranges of likely financial performance  therefore  we will not provide revenue or earnings per share guidance until economic conditions stabilize 
as we enter  we have adapted our priorities to deal with the present economic landscape 
these priorities are centered on our clients  our employees  the efficiency of our operations and our liquidity 
we plan to continue our focus on tapfin and its business model  which has significant advantage to clients who need to gain efficiencies in all aspects of their operations 
there is a great deal of potential to cross market all of tapfin s offerings to more fully serve its clients as we move through this downturn 
our operating efficiency is of particular importance 
we continue to refine our hiring process with the goal of hiring and retaining top talent 
at the same time  we are implementing targeted training programs to increase productivity among our existing sales and recruiting forces 
we are proud of our existing workforce and want to continue to offer them superior career opportunities as we move forward into an economic recovery 
our balance sheet is strong  and we will continue to review acquisitions in the normal course of our business  however  due to current market conditions we will be much more selective in pursuing opportunities this year 
our primary balance sheet focus in will be on refinancing our credit agreement prior to its expiration in march and the continued reduction of our debt balance 
in the meantime  we expect to continue to reduce our debt levels and we are confident in our ability to comply with any of the provisions of our existing credit agreement 

table of contents we have benefited from low tax rates for financial reporting for some time now  but we do not expect that to last indefinitely if we are profitable 
if we are profitable in the future  we will continue to evaluate each quarter our estimates of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of whether any portion of these fully reserved assets become more likely than not recoverable through future taxable income 
at such time  if any  that we no longer have a reserve for our deferred tax assets  we will begin to provide for taxes at the full statutory rate 
our actual cash paid for taxes is expected to remain low in we expect our reported income tax expense to decrease in as compared to due to a change in accounting for utilization of previously acquired tax assets which were fully reserved at the date of acquisition as a result of a new accounting pronouncement effective with the start of fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to revenues of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations  in thousands  except percentages and headcount amounts year ended percent change december  december  december  december  december  december  vs vs revenues from services cost of services gross profit operating costs and expenses selling  general and administrative restructuring costs n a n a depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment  n a n a operating income loss interest expense  net loss on early extinguishment of debt  n a other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss billable headcount at end of period year ended december   compared to year ended december  we recorded an operating loss of million and a net loss of million in in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  or million net of related tax effects

vendor management related fee revenue decreased to million in from million in due to declining fee rates at several customers and a change in the mix of our customers

goodwill impairment 
we recorded a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge in of million 
the impairment was the result of the decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of due to current market conditions 
neither our current operating trends nor our financial results for the fourth quarter were factors that led to the charge 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net was million and million in and  respectively  a decrease of 
the decrease was due to our overall debt reduction as well as a reduction in our related interest rates 
provision for income taxes

the income tax expense of million for contains the following amounts current expenses in the amount of million for federal alternative minimum tax  million for the texas margin tax  michigan gross receipts tax  california corporate income and other miscellaneous state and foreign income tax expenses and a deferred expense in the amount of million resulting from the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on venturi s acquired net deferred assets from the merger 
although our net deferred tax asset is substantially offset with a valuation allowance  a portion of our fully reserved deferred tax assets that became realized through operating profits is recognized as a reduction to goodwill to the extent it relates to benefits acquired in the merger 
this results in deferred tax expense as the assets are utilized 
this portion of deferred tax expense represents the consumption of pre merger deferred tax assets that were acquired with zero basis 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we calculated a goodwill bifurcation ratio in the year of the merger to determine the amount of deferred tax expense that should be offset to goodwill prospectively 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of million  and had recorded a reserve against the assets for net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty related to the realization of these amounts 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
we continue to evaluate quarterly our estimates of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not any portion of these fully reserved are recoverable through future taxable income 
at such time that we no longer have a reserve for our deferred tax assets  we will begin to provide for taxes at the full statutory rate 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for and were million and million  respectively  representing an increase of 
reimbursable expense revenue declined to million in from million in  primarily due to lower consultant related expenses at one major customer

interest expense  net 
interest expense  net was million and million in and  respectively  a decrease of that was due to a reduction in interest payments due to our overall debt reduction during and and a reduction in the related interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the income tax is much lower than typical statutory rates given that income tax expense was in large part offset by a decrease in our valuation allowance

although our net deferred tax asset is substantially offset with a valuation allowance  a portion of our fully reserved deferred tax assets that became realized through operating profits are recognized as adjustments to the purchase price as a reduction to goodwill to the extent they relate to benefits acquired in the merger 
this then results in deferred tax expense as the assets are utilized 
this portion of deferred tax expense represents the consumption of pre merger deferred tax assets that were acquired with zero basis 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we calculated a goodwill bifurcation ratio in the year of the merger to determine the amount of deferred tax asset realizable expense that should be offset to goodwill prospectively 
the income tax benefit for is the result of a federal income tax refund of million  net of the impact of release of the valuation allowance on acquired net deferred tax assets from the merger and a provision for foreign income taxes related to our profitable foreign operations

as of december   we had combined state and federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of million  and had recorded a reserve against the assets for net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty related to the realization of these amounts 
as a result of our section analysis related to the merger of old comsys and venturi  which may have been an ownership change as defined by the internal revenue code  our federal and state net operating losses were reduced by approximately million and million  respectively  during the first quarter of 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview we typically finance our operations through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
due to the requirements of our revolving credit facility  as discussed in more detail below under the cash flows section  we do not maintain a significant cash balance in our primary domestic cash accounts 
in october  we borrowed an additional million on our revolving credit agreement to insure access to liquidity in the current credit environment 
we have invested these additional funds in a us treasury money market fund 
we intend to use these funds to pay down our revolving line of credit when the credit markets stabilize 
our revolving line of credit will mature in march and  thus  we may be required to refinance any outstanding amounts under our credit facilities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we are able to refinance  we expect our costs of borrowing to increase 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay our indebtedness or to refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
excess borrowing availability under our existing revolving credit facility at december   was million 
we expect this number to decline if we enter into a new debt agreement 
our borrowing availability is impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements 
timing of receipts and disbursements in our vendor management business can have a material impact on the debt levels we report at any period and  therefore  in we began reporting average daily debt for each quarter  as discussed below in credit facilities and related covenants 
we believe our cash flow provided by operating activities coupled with availability under our revolving credit facility and our us treasury investments will be sufficient to fund our working capital  debt service and purchases of fixed assets through fiscal in the event that we make future acquisitions  we may need to seek additional capital from our lenders or the capital markets  there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available when we need it  or  if available  that it will be available on favorable terms 
the performance of our business is dependent on many factors and subject to risks and uncertainties 
see risks related to our business and risk related to our indebtedness under risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
working capital accounts receivable is a significant component of our working capital 
we monitor our accounts receivable through a variety of metrics  including days sales outstanding dso 
we calculate our consolidated dso by determining average daily revenue based on an annualized three month analysis and dividing it into the gross accounts receivable balance as of the end of the period 
accounts receivable  net  were million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
our consolidated dso was days as of december  and december  as a result of the timing of vendor management receipts and the seasonality in our operations  our consolidated dso may materially fluctuate 
the non seasonal trends in consolidated dso for can be attributed to the timing of certain receipts and disbursements in a large vendor management engagement 
additionally  we calculate a dso for vendor management services vms dso by determining average daily vendor management service gross revenue based on an annualized three month analysis and dividing it into the gross vendor management accounts receivable balance as of the end of the period 
vendor management accounts receivable were million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
as of december   our vms dso was days as compared to days as of december  the increase in vms dso is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable  the timing of vendor management receipts and the seasonality we experienced in our fourth quarter of as a result of the timing of vendor management receipts and the seasonality in our operations  our vms dso may materially fluctuate 
the non seasonal trends in vms dso for can be attributed to the timing of certain receipts and disbursements in a large vendor management engagement 
our total accounts payable were million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
our vendor management services accounts payable and other liabilities were million and million as of december   and december   respectively 

table of contents credit facilities and related covenants on december   we entered into a new senior credit agreement with merrill lynch capital and a syndicate of lenders which replaced all of our then existing credit agreements 
this senior credit agreement provided for a two year term loan of million  which was funded on december   and which was originally scheduled to be repaid in eight equal quarterly principal installments commencing on march   and a revolving line of credit revolver of up to million  maturing on march  at the same time  we borrowed million under a second lien term loan credit agreement with merrill lynch capital and a syndicate of lenders  which was originally scheduled to mature on october  the proceeds from these borrowings were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the prior credit agreements with merrill lynch capital 
we made the first scheduled principal payment on the senior term loan in the first quarter of in may  we received a federal income tax refund  including interest  totaling million  which was used to pay down the principal balance of the senior term loan 
under the terms of the senior credit agreement  this principal payment reduced the scheduled quarterly payments to million  and the first installment of this reduced amount was paid in the second quarter of on september   the senior credit agreement and second lien term loan were amended 
among other things  the amendments provided for an increase in our borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit to million from million and an increase in the senior term loan to million from million  which was the outstanding principal balance prior to the amendments 
we used borrowings under the amended senior credit agreement to prepay million of the outstanding principal amount of the million second lien term loan 
we incurred charges of approximately million in the third quarter of related to the early repayment on the second lien term loan  the write off of certain deferred financing costs and certain expenses incurred in connection with this refinancing  of which million was recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt and million was included in interest expense 
in addition  we capitalized certain costs of this refinancing of approximately million in the third quarter of on december   the senior credit agreement was further amended 
among other things  the amendments provided for an increase in our borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit to million from million and the early payoff of the remaining million balance of the second lien term loan 
additionally  the maturity date of the agreement was amended to be march  we incurred charges of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to the early repayment of the second lien term loan  the write off of certain deferred financing costs and certain expenses incurred in connection with this refinancing  of which million was recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt and million was included in interest expense 
in addition  we capitalized certain costs of this refinancing of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in connection with our purchase of the remaining outstanding common stock of econometrix in march  we further amended the senior credit agreement to add econometrix as an additional credit party under the agreement 
in connection with our purchase of the issued and outstanding membership interests of plum rhino in may  we further amended the senior credit agreement to add plum rhino as an additional credit party under the agreement and to increase the aggregate amount permitted for acquisitions from million to million 
in connection with our purchases of praeos and twc in december  we further amended the senior credit agreement to add praeos and twc as additional credit parties under the agreement 
borrowings under the revolver bear interest at the prime rate plus a margin that can range from to  or  at our option  libor plus a margin that can range from to  each depending on our total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  as defined in our senior credit agreement  as amended 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the revolver 
we and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the loans and other obligations under the senior credit agreement 
the obligations under the senior credit agreement are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets and those of our us subsidiaries  as well as the shares of capital stock of our direct and indirect us subsidiaries and certain of the capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries 
pursuant to the terms of the senior credit agreement  we maintain a zero balance in our primary domestic cash accounts 
any excess cash in those domestic accounts is swept on a daily basis and applied to repay borrowings under the revolver  and any cash needs are satisfied through borrowings under the revolver 
in a separate cash account  we maintain an additional million we borrowed on our revolver in october to insure access to liquidity in the current credit environment 
we have invested these additional funds in a us treasury money market fund 
borrowings under the revolver are limited to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the senior credit agreement and related amendments  reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit and designated reserves 
at december   these designated reserves were a million minimum availability reserve  a million reserve for outstanding 
table of contents letters of credit  a million reserve for the pure solutions acquisition and a million reserve for the aset acquisition 
the pure solutions reserve will not be required after at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the revolver at interest rates ranging from to per annum weighted average rate of and excess borrowing availability under the revolver of million for general corporate purposes 
at december   our debt to adjusted ebitda ratio resulted in a prime rate margin of and a libor margin of 
fees paid on outstanding letters of credit are equal to the libor margin then applicable to the revolver  which at december   was 
at december   outstanding letters of credit totaled million 
the senior term loan was repaid in full on december  our average daily net debt balances during were as follows  in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter debt compliance our credit facilities contain a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  repurchase shares  declare or pay dividends and other distributions  incur liens  make capital expenditures  make certain investments or acquisitions  repay debt  and dispose of property 
in addition  our credit facilities have springing financial covenants that would require us to satisfy a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum total leverage ratio if our excess availability falls below million 
a breach of any covenants governing our debt would permit the acceleration of the related debt and potentially other indebtedness under cross default provisions  which could harm our business and financial condition 
these restrictions may place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not required to operate under such restrictions or that are subject to less stringent restrictive covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements and we believe we will be able to comply with these covenants throughout the senior credit agreement contains various events of default  including failure to pay principal and interest when due  breach of covenants  materially incorrect representations  default under other agreements  bankruptcy or insolvency  the occurrence of specified erisa events  entry of enforceable judgments against us in excess of million not stayed and the occurrence of a change of control 
in the event of a default  all commitments under the revolver may be terminated and all of our obligations under the senior credit agreement could be accelerated by the lenders  causing all loans and borrowings outstanding including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder to be declared immediately due and payable 
in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency  acceleration of our obligations under our senior credit agreement is automatic 
interest rate swap and cap we have historically been subject to market risk on all or a part of our borrowings under our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates 
effective february   we entered into an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap which we terminated october  the swap agreement and cap agreement were contracts to effectively exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed rate payments over the life of the instruments as a means to limit exposure to increases in interest rates on the notional amount of bank borrowings over the term of the swap and cap 
the notional amount was used to measure interest to be paid or received and did not represent the exposure to credit loss 
the swap was based on a million notional amount at a rate of and the cap was based on a million notional amount at a rate of 
at january   the interest rate swap and cap were recorded at fair value  which represents the amount that merrill lynch capital would have paid us at january   if the swap and cap had been terminated at that date 
the combined net fair value at january   was million  which was included in our consolidated balance sheet in noncurrent assets 
effective with the repayment of our debt on december   the expected cash flows that the swap and cap were 
table of contents designated to hedge against were no longer probable 
as a result  the swap and the cap were no longer designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
as a result  amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with changes in fair value of the hedges were reversed to interest expense 
changes in fair value of the swap and cap were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations subsequent to december  we recorded million as a reduction of interest expense in the fourth quarter of on october   we cancelled the swap and cap agreements and received a cash settlement of million  which was recorded as a reduction to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
secondary offering on behalf of selling stockholders in january  inland partners  lp and links partners  lp inland links and wachovia investors  inc sold an aggregate of million shares of our common stock in a secondary underwritten public offering for the benefit of such stockholders 
the shares were sold by the selling stockholders pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the sec 
both wachovia investors  inc and inland links have representatives on our board of directors 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in this offering 
we paid approximately million of expenses in the first quarter of related to this offering 
cash flows in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  revenues for our vendor management services are recorded on a net basis see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition discussion below 
additionally  the related working capital items ie accounts receivable and accounts payable are recorded separately 
as a result  the timing of cash receipts and disbursements can materially impact our cash provided by earnings and cash flows from operating activities in any period 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for  and  in thousands year ended december  december  december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in net income and a use of cash from working capital 
the increase in was primarily the result of an increase in earnings and improved working capital position compared to the prior year period 
in addition  in  we received a federal income tax refund and related interest totaling million 
in addition to cash provided by earnings  cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements and the working capital requirements of the business 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our cash flows associated with investing activities in  and included capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively  and cash paid for acquisitions of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures was related primarily to the upgrade of our enterprise software system  leasehold improvements related to our new customer service center and the purchase of computer hardware 
we expect to pay an additional million in cash earnout payments during the next months  and these amounts were fully accrued in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  capital expenditures in are currently expected to be approximately million to million 
this spending level is lower than experienced in due to the completion of the previously mentioned projects as well as a planned reduction in capital projects 
cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flows associated with financing activities in  and primarily represent borrowings and payments on our revolving credit facility

any excess cash in our accounts is swept on a daily basis and applied to repay borrowings under the revolver  and any cash needs are satisfied through borrowings under the revolver 
cash and cash equivalents recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december   and december   in the amount of million and million  respectively  represented cash balances at our toronto and united kingdom subsidiaries and million we have invested in a us treasury money market fund 
we expect to use these funds to repay a portion of our senior credit agreement during we believe the most strategic uses of our cash and cash equivalents are repayment of our long term debt  making strategic acquisitions  capital expenditures and investments in revenue producing personnel 
there are no transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in corporate it expenditures 
generally  expenditures are lowest during the first quarter of the year when our clients are finalizing their it budgets 
in addition  our quarterly results may fluctuate depending on  among other things  the number of billing days in a quarter and the seasonality of our clients businesses 
our business is also affected by the timing of holidays and seasonal vacation patterns  generally resulting in lower revenues and gross margins in the fourth quarter of each year 
extreme weather conditions may also affect demand in the first and fourth quarters of the year as certain of our clients facilities are located in geographic areas subject to closure or reduced hours due to inclement weather 
in addition  we experience an increase in our cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross profit and gross margin in the first fiscal quarter of each year as a result of resetting certain state and federal employment tax rates and related salary limitations

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates include the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  the recoverability of goodwill  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves for medical costs  tax related contingencies and realization of deferred tax assets 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our operations and include the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of comsys it partners  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue pursuant to staff accounting bulletin nos 
and  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  we recognize revenue and record sales  net of related discounts  when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership has transferred to the customer  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our core staffing revenues vary from period to period based on several factors that include the billable headcount during the period  the number of billing days during the period  and the average bill rate during the period 
revenues under time and materials contracts are recorded at the time services are performed 
hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications 
alternatively  the bill rates for some assignments are based on a mark up over compensation and other direct and indirect costs 
revenues from services are shown net of rebates and discounts relating primarily to volume related discount structures and prompt payment discounts under contracts with our clients 
we report revenues from vendor management services net of the related pass through labor costs 
vendor management services are services that allow our clients to automate and consolidated management of their temporary personnel contracting processes 
we also report revenues net for payrolling activity 
payrolling is defined as a situation in which we accept a client identified consultant for payroll processing in exchange for a fee 
permanent placement fee revenues are usually determined based on a percentage of the employee s first year cash compensation and are recorded when candidates begin their employment 
reimbursable expenses are expenses we pay to our consultants that are reimbursed by our clients 
we record reimbursable expenses in revenue with the associated cost recorded in cost of services 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill 
we assess recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be tested annually for impairment  unless an event occurs or circumstances change during the year that reduce or may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value  in which event an impairment charge may be required during the year 
we have selected 
table of contents the last day of the second to last month of our fiscal year as the date on which we will perform our annual goodwill impairment test 
we performed our annual impairment test as of november  at november   we performed the first step of the two step impairment test and compared the fair value of the reporting unit management has previously determined the company operates as one reporting unit to its carrying value 
in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit  we considered both the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the quoted market price of companies comparable to the reporting unit 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimated future revenue growth rates  gross margins on sales  operating margins  capital expenditures and discount rates 
each approach was weighted in order to arrive at the fair value of the reporting unit 
we determined the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value 
thus we performed step two of the impairment test for the reporting unit 
in step two of the impairment test  we are required to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
we allocated the fair value of the reporting unit to the respective assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a separate business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting units over the amounts assigned to their respective assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied goodwill was less than the carrying value of goodwill  resulting in a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of we then reconciled the fair value of the reporting unit to our market capitalization at november  at december   and december   total goodwill was million and million  respectively 
the annual test requires estimates and judgments by management to determine a valuation for the reporting unit 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
different assumptions related to future cash flows  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates could result in additional future impairment charges  which would be recognized as a non cash charge to operating income and a reduction in asset values and shareholders equity on the balance sheet 
other intangible assets 
our intangible assets other than goodwill primarily represents acquired customer lists and are amortized over the respective contract terms or estimated life of the customer list  ranging from five to eight years 
at december   and december   net intangible assets were million and million  respectively 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate intangibles or other long lived assets may be impaired  we evaluate the recoverability and estimated useful lives of such assets 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
we performed an impairment test as of november   and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
we believe that all of our long lived assets are fully realizable as of december  collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical level of write offs and judgments management makes about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
further  we monitor current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
additional allowances may be required if the economy or the financial condition of our customers deteriorates 
if we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
as of december   and december   the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the statement of operations 
at december   we had two types of stock based employee compensation stock options and restricted stock 
we have only awarded restricted stock since january restricted stock 
we measure the fair value of restricted shares based upon the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
these grants typically vest over a three year period and any unvested awards expire at the end of the vesting period 
restricted stock awards that vest in accordance with service conditions are amortized over their applicable 
table of contents vesting period using the straight line method adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
for nonvested share awards partially or wholly subject to performance conditions  we are required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met 
if the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable  we will recognize the expense using the straight line attribution method 
if such performance conditions are not met  no performance based compensation expense will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense will be reversed 
we have not historically issued any restricted stock awards subject to market conditions 
stock options 
the fair value of our stock option awards or modifications of these awards is estimated at the date of grant or modification using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
due to the limited trading history of our common stock following the merger  expected stock price volatility for stock option grants or modifications prior to was based on an analysis of the actual realized historical volatility of our common stock as well as that of our peers 
beginning in  the expected volatility assumption for stock option grants or modifications was based on actual historical volatility of our common stock from the period after our december common stock offering through the quarter ended prior to the grant or modification date 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee forfeitures within the valuation model 
the expected life is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
no excess tax benefit has been recognized related to our stock based compensation since none were realized due to our loss carryforwards 
in addition  for both stock options and nonvested share awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different  and we would have to take an additional stock based compensation charge or credit  which could be material 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested option and restricted stock awards at december   that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of months 
income tax assets and liabilities we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
although our net deferred tax asset is substantially offset with a valuation allowance  a portion of our reserved deferred tax assets that become realized through operating profits are recognized as adjustments to the purchase price as a reduction to goodwill to the extent they relate to benefits acquired in the merger 
this then results in deferred tax expense in the year the acquired deferred tax assets are utilized 
this portion of deferred tax expense represents the consumption of pre merger deferred tax assets that were acquired with zero basis 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we calculated a goodwill bifurcation ratio in the year of the merger to determine the amount of deferred tax asset realizable expense that should be offset to goodwill prospectively 
beginning in  we will change our accounting for the remaining reserved deferred tax assets that previously would have been treated as reductions to goodwill 
this will result in a decline in our reported income tax expense see recent accounting pronouncements below 
we record an income tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these deferred tax items represent expenses or operating losses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which will result in tax deductions over varying future periods 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates that may affect the amount of the valuation allowance include estimates of future taxable income  timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and other tax planning strategies that may be available to us 
we record an estimated tax liability or tax benefit for income and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we use our best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent upon various matters  including resolution of tax audits  and may differ from amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded as a provision or benefit to income tax expense in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability or benefit differs from the recorded amount 

table of contents our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
if we continue to be profitable  we will continue to evaluate each quarter our estimates of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of whether any portion of these fully reserved assets become more likely than not recoverable through future taxable income 
at such time  if any  that we no longer have a reserve for our deferred tax assets  we will begin to provide for taxes at the full statutory rate 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in addition  we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  in accordance with the threshold and measurement attributes of fin  uncertainties in accounting for income taxes  if any  are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and we adopted the new requirements in its fiscal first quarter of the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fsp 
fsp delays the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb also issued fsp no 
that would exclude leasing transactions accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp  which applies to financial assets within the scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in accordance with sfas fsp clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and defines additional key criteria in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
we do not expect the sfas related guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which provides new accounting requirements for business combinations 
sfas r defines a business combination as a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one of more businesses 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and we will adopt the new requirements in its fiscal first quarter of we will apply sfas r prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after december  additionally  the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our income tax provision 
any future release of our existing tax valuation allowance related to acquired tax benefits in a purchase business combination when reversed  will be reflected as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations 
under the previous accounting standards  the reversal would have been recorded to goodwill as well as income tax expense 
as a result  we expect our reported income tax expense to decline in in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is prohibited 
the impact of fsp fas will depend upon the nature  terms  and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
in june  the fasb issued fsp emerging issues task force  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or 
table of contents unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
fsp eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
upon adoption  a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data including any amounts related to interim periods  summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform with the provisions of fsp eitf we do not expect the adoption of fsp eitf to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following assessment of our market risks does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax and credit risks 
we are exposed to market risks  primarily related to interest rate  foreign currency and equity price fluctuations 
our use of derivative instruments has historically been insignificant and it is expected that our use of derivative instruments will continue to be minimal 
interest rate risks outstanding debt under our senior credit agreement at december   was approximately million 
interest on borrowings under the agreement is based on the prime rate or libor plus a variable margin 
based on the outstanding balance at december   a change of in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
in october  we borrowed an additional million on our revolving credit agreement to insure access to liquidity in the current credit environment 
we have invested these additional funds in a us treasury money market fund 
we evaluate our invested funds to respond appropriately to a reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
foreign currency risks our primary exposures to foreign currency fluctuations are associated with transactions and related assets and liabilities related to our operations in canada and the united kingdom 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
the assets and liabilities on our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  in our consolidated balance sheets 
these operations are not material to our overall business 
equity market risks the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations could impact our decision or ability to utilize the equity markets as a potential source of our funding needs in the future 
as a result of the decline in our trading stock price during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge 
further declines in our stock price could result in additional impairment charges
