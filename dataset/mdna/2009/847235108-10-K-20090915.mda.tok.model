information provided at the website includes  among other items  the annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  quarterly earnings releases  news releases  and the code of ethics  as well as various corporate charters 
the company operates in one line of business  electronic manufacturing services ems 
sparton s capabilities range from product design and development through aftermarket support  specializing in total business solutions for government  medical scientific instrumentation  aerospace and industrial markets 
this includes the design  development and or manufacture of electronic parts and assemblies for both government and commercial customers worldwide 
governmental sales are mainly sonobuoys 
the private securities litigation reform act of reflects congress determination that the disclosure of forward looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward looking statements by corporate management 
this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the scope of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of the words expects  anticipates  believes  intends  plans  will  shall  and similar expressions  and the negatives of such expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements which refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly disclose any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring subsequent to filing this form k with the securities and exchange commission sec 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those discussed below 
accordingly  sparton s future results may differ materially from historical results or from those discussed or implied by these forward looking statements 
the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the actual results and experience to differ materially from anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
sparton  as a high mix  low to medium volume supplier  provides rapid product turnaround for customers 
high mix describes customers needing multiple product types with generally low to medium volume manufacturing runs 
as a contract manufacturer with customers in a variety of markets  the company has substantially less visibility of end user demand and  therefore  forecasting sales can be problematic 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities and or reschedule production for a number of reasons 
depressed economic conditions may result in customers delaying delivery of product  or the placement of purchase orders for lower volumes than previously anticipated 
unplanned cancellations  reductions  or delays by customers may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
as many of the company s costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed within given ranges of production  a reduction in customer demand can disproportionately affect the company s gross margins and operating income 
the majority of the company s sales have historically come from a limited number of customers 
significant reductions in sales to  or a loss of  one of these customers could materially impact our operating results if the company were not able to replace those sales with new business 
other risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations  performance  growth forecasts and business results include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  sharp volatility of world financial markets over a short period of time  competition in the overall ems business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  foreign currency exchange rate risk  uncertainties associated with the outcome of litigation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws and the uncertainties of environmental remediation  customer labor and work strikes  and uncertainties related to defects discovered in certain of the company s aerospace circuit boards 
further risk factors are the availability and cost of materials 
a number of events can impact these risks and uncertainties  including potential escalating utility and other related costs due to natural disasters  as well as political uncertainties such as the conflict in iraq 
the company has encountered availability and extended lead time issues on some electronic components due to strong market demand  this resulted in higher prices and or late deliveries 
in addition  some electronics components used in production are available from a limited number of suppliers  or a single supplier  which may affect availability and or pricing 
additionally  the timing of sonobuoy sales to the us navy is dependent upon access to the test range and successful passage of product tests performed by the us navy 
reduced governmental budgets have made access to the test range less predictable and less frequent than in the past 
additional risk factors that have arisen more recently include risks associated with the increasingly tightened credit market  the company s ability to maintain its credit facility on similar or more favorable terms  dependence on key personnel  recent volatility in the stock markets  and the impact on the company s defined contribution plan  and the risk that the company s stock might be delisted from the new york stock exchange nyse 
finally  the sarbanes oxley act of required changes in  and formalization of  some of the company s corporate governance and compliance practices 
the sec and nyse also passed rules and regulations requiring additional compliance activities 
compliance with these rules has increased administrative costs  and it is expected that certain of these costs will continue indefinitely 
a further discussion of the company s risk factors has been included in part i  item a  risk factors  of this report 
management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events 

table of contents the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
executive summary in summary  the major elements affecting fiscal results compared to fiscal results were as follows in millions net loss fiscal gain on deming  nm plant sale in fiscal litigation write off in fiscal items increased margin resulting from disengagement terms with one customer increased restructuring impairment charges improved margin on government programs decreased income tax expense increased legal and consulting expense increased pension expense increased translation transaction exchange expense other net change net loss fiscal fiscal was impacted by consistent and successful sonobuoy drop tests contributing improved margins 
margins improved due to improved labor efficiencies and less rework cost 
there were no minimal or zero margin contracts in sales in fiscal higher sales in the aerospace market of million 
increased margin resulting from disengagement agreement with one aerospace customer 
increased administrative expenses primarily related to legal and consulting fees totaling million above prior year 
increased pension expense  primarily related to lump sum settlement and curtailment charges  of million above prior year 
increased restructuring impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal over prior year 
income tax expense of million in fiscal  resulting principally from uncertainty in realization of future tax benefits 
during the last six months of fiscal  sparton announced several restructuring actions that were being taken as part of the company s turnaround strategy 
included among these actions were company wide reductions in force  the closure of the jackson  michigan and london  ontario facilities  changes in certain employee benefit plans and the disengagement from a significant customer 
while the company believes these actions will ultimately improve profitability  the implementation of these actions will take time to complete 
a significant portion of the charges associated with these actions has been incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal future quarters  particularly the first two quarters of fiscal  may be impacted depending on the timing of the completion of the respective actions 
these various factors  among others  are further discussed below 
in this context  sparton alerts readers that our president and chief executive officer initiated during fiscal a full evaluation of our operations  including operating structure 
this evaluation  which is ongoing  likely may result in changes to our analysis of how the components of sparton s business contribute to consolidated operating results and the overall level of disaggregation of reported financial data  including the nature and number of operating segments  disclosure of segment information and the consistency of such information with internal management reports 
the management discussion and analysis of operations disclosure in the company s periodic report beginning in fiscal is expected to reflect the changes that arise due to this evaluation

table of contents liquidity and capital resources until the past several years  the primary source of liquidity and capital resources had historically been generated from operations 
in recent periods  borrowings on the company s revolving line of credit facility have increasingly been relied on to provide necessary working capital in light of significant operating cash flow deficiencies sustained primarily since fiscal however  fiscal generated million of operating cash flows  primarily due to certain government contracts allowing for billings to occur when certain milestones under the program are reached  independent of the amount expended as of that point 
these billings reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be required during the performance of these contracts 
as of june   million of billings in excess of costs have occurred 
in fiscal  the company s line of credit commitment was reduced to million from the previous million  and was further subject to a limitation of of eligible accounts receivable 
subsequent to june   the company finalized an agreement for replacement financing  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  subsequent events  at which time the current line of credit balance was paid off 
during  the company expects to meet its liquidity needs through a combination of sources including  but not limited to  operations  its line of credit  interim billings on certain government contracts  the proceeds from sales of closed facilities  and improved cash flow from changes in how the company finances inventory 
it is anticipated that usage of the line of credit and interim government billings will continue to be a component in providing sparton s working capital 
improving operating cash flow is one of sparton s priorities  along with increasing its availability and access to credit facilities 
with the above sources providing the expected cash flows  the company believes that it will have sufficient liquidity for its anticipated needs over the next months 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash and cash equivalents increased  to  primarily driven by reduction in the amount of inventory carried and receipt of us government milestone billings 
net cash provided by and used in operating activities totaled  in fiscal and  in fiscal the primary use of cash from operating activities in fiscal was the funding of operating losses 
the primary source of cash in fiscal was the decrease in inventories  primarily due to the company s focus on reducing the level of inventory carried  as well as the receipt of cash from us government milestone billings 
the primary use of cash in fiscal was for the increase in inventories and accounts receivable  as well as funding operating losses 
the increase in inventories and accounts receivable was primarily due to new job starts  the delay in some customer schedules  and increased sales levels 
the primary source of cash in fiscal was the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  primarily due to the increase in inventories to support new job starts 
cash flows used by investing activities in fiscal totaled  cash flows used by investing activities in fiscal totaled  the primary uses of cash from investing activities in fiscal and was the purchase of property  plant and equipment  and additional purchase price payments to the sellers of sms as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the expenditures in fiscal and were related to new roofing at one facility 
cash provided in was primarily due to the sale of the deming facility located in new mexico  as further discussed below 
cash flows used by financing activities in fiscal were  cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal were  the primary source of cash from financing activities in fiscal and was from accessing the company s bank line of credit  but to a much lower extent in fiscal due to the positive operating cash flows 
the primary use of cash from financing activities in fiscal and was the repayment of debt 
historically  the company s market risk exposure to foreign currency exchange and interest rates on third party receivables and payables was not considered to be material  principally due to their short term nature and the minimal amount of receivables and payables designated in foreign currency 
however  due to the greater volatility of the canadian dollar  the impact of transaction and translation gains on intercompany activity and balances has increased 
if the exchange rate were to materially change  the company s financial position could be significantly affected 
however  with the closure of the canadian facility  as discussed further below  it is anticipated that the impact in future periods will decrease 
as of june   the company s bank line of credit totaled million million prior to january  of which million had been borrowed 
in addition  the company had a bank term loan totaling million 
this bank debt was subject to certain covenants which were not met at june   however  the lender waived its right to accelerate payment of the debt arising from our non compliance at that date 
subsequent to june   the company finalized an agreement for replacement financing  as discussed above 
finally  there are notes payable totaling million outstanding to the former owners of astro  as well as million of industrial revenue bonds 
borrowings are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at june  and  the aggregate government funded ems backlog was approximately million and million  respectively 
commercial ems orders as of june  and totaled million and million  respectively 
commercial orders  in general  may be rescheduled or cancelled without significant penalty  and  as a result  may not be a meaningful measure of future sales 
a majority of the june   backlog is expected to be realized in the next months

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item  the following involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of sparton s board of directors 

table of contents environmental contingencies one of sparton s former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico coors road  has been the subject of ongoing investigations and remediation efforts conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment  operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes legal and consulting services in the periods incurred and reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes in these estimates 
government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted with respect to revenue recognition and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs including  but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended  and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
in addition  estimated total contract costs can be significantly affected by changing test routines and procedures  resulting design modifications and production rework from these changing test routines and procedures  and limited range access for testing these design modifications and rework solutions 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change  sometimes significantly  as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
changes in estimates can also occur when new designs are initially placed into production 
the company formally reviews its costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts at least quarterly and revised estimated total contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
advance billings in excess of inventoried costs are included in current liabilities 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant government contracts 
commercial inventory valuation allowances inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer inventories require a significant degree of judgment 
these allowances are influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring materials in excess of customer product demand 
contracts with some commercial customers may be based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently changes  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities  with adjustments made accordingly 
as of june  and  the valuation allowances totaled  and  respectively 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers or  in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in full  a charge is taken against income and a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
conversely  should the disposition of adjusted excess and obsolete inventories result in recoveries in excess of these reduced carrying values  the remaining portion of the valuation allowances are reversed and taken into income when such determinations are made 
it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes to inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer excess and obsolete inventories 
allowance for probable losses on receivables the accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from customers 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments  and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
accounts receivable are generally due under normal trade terms for the industry 
credit is granted  and credit evaluations are periodically performed  based on a customer s financial condition and other factors 
although the company does not generally require collateral  cash in advance or letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances  including some foreign customers 
when management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected  it is charged against the allowance for probable losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance monthly 
the allowance for doubtful accounts considered necessary was  and  at june  and  respectively 

table of contents if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
given the company s significant balance of government receivables and letters of credit from foreign customers  collection risk is considered minimal 
historically  uncollectible accounts have generally been insignificant  have generally not exceeded management s expectations  and the allowance is deemed adequate 
pension obligations the company calculates the cost of providing pension benefits under the provisions of applicable accounting standards 
the key assumptions required within the provisions of sfas no 
are used in making these calculations 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is consistent with market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments 
the expected return on assets is based on long term returns and assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from the assumptions  future adjustments to the financial statements would be required 
while changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension benefit obligation and the unrecognized gain or loss accounts disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the effect of changes in these assumptions is not expected to have the same relative effect on net periodic pension expense in the near term 
while these assumptions may change in the future based on changes in long term interest rates and market conditions  there are no known expected changes in these assumptions as of june  as indicated above  to the extent the assumptions differ from actual results  there would be a future impact on the financial statements 
the extent to which this will result in future expense is not determinable at this time as it will depend upon a number of variables  including trends in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
during the quarter ended june   the annual actuarial valuation of the pension plan was completed 
based on this valuation  net periodic pension expense prior to curtailment and settlement expenses for fiscal was calculated to be  compared to  for fiscal on february   the company announced that it would freeze participation and the accrual of benefits in the sparton corporation pension plan  effective april  as a result of this freeze  actuarial calculations for fiscal were updated with an effective date of february  based on this actuarial calculation  a  curtailment charge was recognized during fiscal  related to the acceleration of all remaining prior service costs previously being amortized over future periods as a result of plant closures and reductions in force 
in addition  lump sum benefit distributions during fiscal exceeded plan service and interest costs  resulting in a lump sum settlement charge of  which was recognized during the year ended june  these settlement charges resulted from several business and economic factors that have affected the measurement of the plan s projected benefit obligation in recent years  including the recent management actions described above  changes in the plan s benefit formula  the timing of participants retirement  changes in assumed interest rates  variation in investment returns  and the amounts of lump sum distributions paid 
the components of net periodic pension expense are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
on june   the company adopted the balance sheet recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  and on june  adopted the measurement date provisions 
this statement required sparton to recognize the funded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of its plan in the june  consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss at adoption represents the balance of the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs  at that date  all of which were previously netted against the plan s funded status in sparton s balance sheet 
upon adoption  sparton recorded an after tax  unrecognized loss in the amount of  which represents an increase directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of june  these amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic plan expenses pursuant to sparton s historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 
further  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods  and that are not recognized as net periodic plan expenses in the same periods  will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
the adoption of the balance sheet recognition provisions of sfas no 
had no effect on sparton s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june   or for any prior period presented  and it will not affect sparton s operating results in future periods 
the adoption of the measurement date provisions in fiscal resulted in transitional charges directly to the opening balances of retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive loss of  and  net of tax respectively  as further discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company allocated the purchase price of its may sms acquisition to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates  judgments and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 

table of contents management arrived at estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired business and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected discounted cash flows from customer relationships and contracts assuming similar product platforms and completed projects  the acquired company s market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired customer relationships will continue to generate revenue streams  and attrition and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results  particularly with respect to amortization periods assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
valuation of property  plant and equipment the company records an impairment charge on our investment in property  plant and equipment that we hold and use in our operations if and when management determines that the related carrying values may not be recoverable 
if one or more impairment indicators are deemed to exist  sparton will measure any impairment of these assets based on current independent appraisals or a projected discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated operating results and are subject to many factors 
the most recent such impairment analysis  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulted in  of impairment charges and was related to three facilities  all of which are now closed 
the impairment was primarily related to the jackson  michigan facility closure  whose valuation resulted in  of the charges 
goodwill and customer relationships the company annually reviews goodwill associated with its investments in cybernet and sms for possible impairment 
this analysis may be performed more often should events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the sms impairment analysis is a two step process 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of sms to its carrying value 
if the fair value of sms exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to sms exceeds the fair value of sms  then management will perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill of sms 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
additionally  the company performs impairment testing of an amortized intangible whenever indicators are present that an impairment of the asset may exist 
if an impairment of the asset is determined to exist  the impairment is recognized and the asset is written down to its fair value  which value then becomes the new amortizable base 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment is prohibited 
determining the fair value of any reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates  operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and  if appropriate  determination of appropriate market comparables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  the company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of the company s reporting units 
the most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis related to the company s cybernet and sms investments was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal that impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge 
the next such impairment reviews are expected to be performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal deferred costs and claims for reimbursement in the normal course of business  the company from time to time incurs costs and or seeks related reimbursements or recovery claims from third parties 
such amounts  when recovery is considered probable  are generally reported as other non current assets 
nevertheless  uncertainty is usually present in making these assessments and if the company is not ultimately successful in recovering these recorded amounts  there could be a material impact on operating results in any one fiscal period 
during fiscal and  the company recognized losses of million and million  respectively in connection with adjusting certain recorded claims to their estimated net realized values 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

table of contents income taxes our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item these estimates reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid or received on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
the recorded net deferred income tax assets were reduced during fiscal by a significant valuation allowance 
during fiscal  the company increased the existing valuation allowance  net of the change in certain deferred tax liabilities  to cover the remaining deferred tax assets 
additionally  as of june  there was approximately million of canadian net deferred tax assets  however  as canada s operations ceased during fiscal  the company also fully offset canada s gross deferred tax asset at june  by a valuation allowance 
restructuring accrual during the last six months of fiscal  the company has recorded restructuring accruals  principally as a result of contract termination costs  work force reductions  plant and other facility closings  and related equipment transfers and associated activities  and expects going forward to recognize additional provisions as a result of these initiatives 
generally costs associated with restructuring activities are recognized only when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
however  in the case of leases  the expense is estimated and accrued when the property ceases to be used or is vacated 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such restructuring activities  this process can involve periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to periodically record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
other matters change of executive officers in april  the company entered into an employment agreement with mr 
slome  its newly appointed senior vice president and chief financial officer 
the agreement generally provides for a fixed annual base compensation amount  an annual performance bonus based on goal attainments  incentive plan  other customary benefits  and termination without cause considerations 
there is no set term for this agreement 
in january  the company entered into an employment agreement with mr 
madlock  its newly appointed senior vice president of operations 
the agreement generally provides for a fixed annual base compensation amount  annual performance bonus based on goal attainments  incentive plan  other customary benefits  and termination without cause considerations 
there is no set term for this agreement 
in november  concurrent with the appointment of mr 
wood  the company s new chief executive officer  and the continued retention of mr 
richard langley  its then president formerly the interim ceo  sparton entered into employment agreements with each of the two executives 
mr 
langley s employment under his employment agreement has terminated and he entered into a retirement agreement with the company in april pursuant to the retirement agreement  mr 
langley no longer acts as the president  but he will continue to receive his annual salary  less payroll taxes required to be withheld by law  through the term of his retirement agreement which expires on july   and he will provide consulting services to the company 
mr 
wood s employment agreement generally provides for a fixed annual base compensation amount  an annual performance bonus based on goal attainments  a portion of which is guaranteed in fiscal and  incentive plans  other customary benefits  and termination without cause considerations 
the initial term of his agreement is years 
litigation one of sparton s facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico  has been the subject of ongoing investigations conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the investigation began in the early s and involved a review of onsite and offsite environmental impacts 
at june   sparton has accrued  as its estimate of the future undiscounted minimum financial liability with 
table of contents respect to this matter 
the company s cost estimate is based upon existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs  which are expensed as incurred  and is anticipated to cover approximately the next years 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for onsite and offsite operations and is based on existing methodology 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally  a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be affected significantly by the impact of the ultimate resolution of this contingency 
some of the printed circuit boards supplied to the company for its aerospace sales were discovered in fiscal to be nonconforming and defective 
the defect occurred during production at the raw board supplier s facility  prior to shipment to sparton for further processing 
the company and our customer  who received the defective boards  contained the defective boards 
while investigations were underway  million of related product and associated incurred costs were initially deferred and classified in sparton s balance sheet within other non current assets 
in august  sparton electronics florida  inc filed an action in the us district court  middle district of florida against electropac co 
inc and a related party the raw board manufacturer to recover these costs 
a trial was conducted in august and the trial court made a partial ruling in favor of sparton  however  the court awarded an amount less than the previously deferred million 
following this ruling  a provision for a loss of million was established in the fourth quarter of fiscal court ordered mediation was conducted following the court s ruling and a settlement was reached in september for payment to the company of million plus interest 
the settlement is secured by a mortgage on real property and a consent judgment 
in december  a recovery of million against the million was received with the remaining balance due in september in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company established a reserve of million against the remaining settlement balance 
as of june   million remains in other current assets in the company s balance sheet  compared to the million reported in other non current assets as of june  the million balance is expected to be received in fiscal settlement proceeds were previously assigned to national city bank to pay down bank term debt as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements and are now part of the general collateral underlying sparton s credit facility 
if the defendants are unable to pay the final judgment  our before tax operating results at that time could be adversely affected by up to million 
the company has pending an action before the us court of federal claims to recover damages arising out of an alleged infringement by the us navy of certain patents held by sparton and used in the production of sonobuoys 
pursuant to an agreement between the company and counsel conducting the litigation  a significant portion of the claim will be retained by the company s counsel in contingent fees if the litigation is successfully concluded 
a trial of the matter was conducted by the court in april and may of  and the timing of a decision in this matter is uncertain at this time 
the likelihood that the claim will be resolved and the extent of any recovery in favor of the company is unknown at this time and no receivable has been recorded by the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure the company manufactures its products in the united states and vietnam  and ceased manufacturing in canada during the fourth quarter of fiscal sales are to the us and canada  as well as other foreign markets 
the company is potentially subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to intercompany activity and balances and to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
also  adjustments related to the translation of the company s canadian and vietnamese financial statements into us dollars are included in current earnings 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the domestic and foreign markets in which the company operates 
however  minimal third party receivables and payables are denominated in foreign currency and the related market risk exposure is considered to be immaterial 
historically  foreign currency gains and losses related to intercompany activity and balances have not been significant 
however  due to the greater volatility of the canadian dollar  the impact of transaction and translation gains has increased 
if the exchange rate were to materially change  the company s financial position could be significantly affected 
the company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to such interest rate changes 
based on the fact that interest rates periodically adjust to market values for the line of credit  interest rate risk is not considered to be significant
