these segments reflect the company s internal organizational structure  as well as the processes by which management makes operating decisions  allocates resources and assesses performance 
roxio consumer segment products and services the company s roxio consumer segment creates software and services that enable consumers to easily create  manage  and share personal digital media content on and across a broad range of connected devices 
a wide array of leading technology companies and developers rely on roxio products  services and technologies to bring innovative digital media functionality to pcs and next generation ce devices and platforms 
roxio offers products and services under a variety of names  including backontrack  backup mypc  cineplayer  crunch  easy vhs to dvd  just burn  mydvd  mytv to go  photoshow  photosuite  popcorn  recordnow  roxio copy convert  roxio creator  toast  videowave  winoncd  and others 
sales and distribution  markets most roxio products are sold in a number of different versions and languages 
the company distributes roxio products through various channels  including bundling arrangements with oems  volume licensing programs  its web store  and third party web based and bricks and mortar retail stores 
the company also markets the same under the hood technology that powers roxio products to other companies who wish to build their own pc software products 
oem bundling a primary channel for the company s roxio applications software is the inclusion or bundling of the company s products with compatible products sold by oems 
the company believes that most consumers first become exposed to digital media software when they purchase a new pc or a ce device  such as a mobile phone  and begin to use the software that comes bundled with the pc or ce device 
some of these new users later add to their software capabilities via upgrades or add ons  in many cases through web transactions or purchases at retail locations 
the company s oem customers include roxio software as a value added offering for their customers and often pay the company a royalty on each copy of the software shipped with their products 
typically the royalty paid is only a small fraction of the retail price for the company s software 
the company enters into bundling arrangements because they generate revenue for the company as well as create a large installed base of customers to whom it can sell upgraded  enhanced or different versions of its products 
the company has bundling arrangements with a variety of oems whose products include such features as video capture and interface cards  dvd recorders  cd recorders  pc models that include dvd recorders  pc models that include cd recorders  pc models positioned as multimedia pcs  mobile phones and other devices 
many of the company s bundle deals permit it to capture customer registrations or to invite the customer to click through to the www 
roxio 
com web site where it can offer additional products for sale directly 
the company also has non traditional bundling programs with some of its oem customers  under which the company reduces or eliminates the royalty due to it when a copy of its product is shipped by the oem 
in return the oem actively promotes the purchase of an enhanced version of the bundled product  either at point of sale that is the point at which end user customers purchase a pc or other device or after point of sale 
the resulting revenues are split between the company and the oem 
the largest such program is currently with dell 
the company usually does not provide end user support as part of its bundling arrangements  instead relying on oems to support the end user customers 
the company typically does provide second line support to oems to back up their first line support of the company s products to their consumer customers 
roxio maintains an engineering and delivery staff that concentrates on oems 
oem customers tend to be very sensitive to product quality and stability  and usually are focused on providing their end user customers with a simple  elegant  and trouble free experience 
they often demand significant customization of roxio products to meet their particular requirements 
oems  particularly those with high volume businesses  require strict adherence to the release schedules of their product lines 
volume licensing the company licenses roxio applications software for use by corporate and institutional organizations on populations of in house pcs 
in many ways  volume licensing resembles the company s oem business there is a single point of sale for a large number of copies of its software  the price per copy is usually set at a significant discount from retail price  often a single copy of its software is provided that the volume license customer then replicates for internal deployment 
volume license customers also tend to be highly focused on product quality and stability as well as on a simple  elegant  and trouble free user experience

technology licensing in connection with its cinemanow service and premium software offerings  the company licenses its technology to ce device manufacturers  including companies that make the integrated circuits used by equipment manufacturers 
the customers and agreements for this business are similar to those for the technology licensing business engaged in by the company through its roxio consumer segment 
patent program the premium content segment also includes the company s patent management and commercialization program 
under the patent program the company identifies patentable ideas that arise in the course of its internal development operations  assesses and acquires patents as part of its business acquisitions  and assesses and may acquire patents and patent portfolios from other companies  although it has not made an acquisition of separate patents or patent portfolios to date

sales and distribution  markets the company sells its professional products through a field sales force in combination with a network of specialized professional audio video dealers 
as of march   the company employed people in its field sales organization for premium content professional products 
sales personnel are based in the company s headquarters in novato  ca as well as its offices in santa clara  ca  burbank  ca  london  england and tokyo  japan 
most of the company s field sales personnel operate under compensation arrangements in which a substantial portion of their compensation is contingent upon performance relative to revenue targets 
the company s professional customers span the hollywood to home spectrum 
on the hollywood end  the company s professional products are mainly sold to the high end film and video post production facilities that process and prepare audio  video and film content for delivery across a variety of broadcast  broadband and mobile playback platforms

the company offers its cinemanow service directly through its www 
cinemanow 
com website and  increasingly  through third party partners who offer the service through their own websites  through computers and through ce devices 
to the extent that the company offers the cinemanow service through pc and ce oems  its distribution relationships are similar to  and often overlap with  the oem relationships that it establishes through the roxio consumer segment 
competitive environment a number of companies produce or have produced products that compete with some or all of the company s premium product and service offerings 
the company s cinemanow service  in particular  faces a wide range of competition from other companies seeking to position themselves strategically as the digital distribution of hollywood movies and other premium content grows in scope and importance 
significant competition exists from well established traditional premium content distribution channels  including retailers that rent  sell or trade dvds and games  cable and satellite video on demand vod services  and other in home entertainment 
consumers have a variety of vendor choices and multiple distribution options for premium content consumption  and the company believes that this competition will increase over the coming years as the proliferation of digital delivery continues 
some of the company s competitors have greater financial or organizational resources and or greater familiarity than the company does with certain technologies 
segment information the premium content segment accounted for approximately of net revenue for fiscal year see note  significant customer information  segment reporting and geographic information  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of the company s financial data by business segment  geography and customer concentration 
general business factors the matters described in this section apply generally to the company s business activities  including both of its operating segments 
intellectual property the company protects its proprietary rights through a variety of means and measures  including patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  contractual restrictions and technical measures 
the company generally offers its products and services subject to purchase and license agreements that restrict unauthorized disclosure of its proprietary software and designs  or copying for purposes other than the use intended when the product is sold 
the company owns or licenses many patents and has a number of patent applications pending in the united states and foreign countries 
the status of software and business method patent protection has been in flux 
on the one hand  there has recently been a trend on the part of patent authorities to grant patents in audio and video processing techniques and  in particular  for software based techniques  with increasing liberality 
on the other hand  there has been an increasing tendency on the part of some courts to invalidate patents granted by the patent authorities for example  in the case of ksr v 
teleflex april  the us supreme court enunciated a new standard of obviousness that may call into question many patents granted under the recent  liberal patent regime 
given the general confusion and imprecision in this area  the company believes that it is quite possible that some of its present or future products might be found to infringe issued or yet to be issued patents  and it is almost certain that the company will be asked by patent holders to respond to infringement claims 
if such patents were held to be valid  and if they covered a portion of the company s technology for which there was no ready substitute  the company might suffer significant market and financial losses 
the company has endeavored to reduce its risk to some extent by means of contractual provisions 
for example  in the case of low revenue per copy bundling agreements with oem customers  the company typically attempts to limit any indemnity it provides to its customers against the possibility that their use of its products will ultimately be held to be infringing 
however  not all of the company s oem customers are willing to agree to the terms that the company seeks  and  even if they agree  there is no assurance that such limitations in the bundling agreements will in fact reduce the company s exposure to liability 
the company relies to a great extent on the protection the law gives to trade secrets to protect its proprietary technology 
the company policy is to request confidentiality agreements from all of its employees and key consultants  and it regularly enters into confidentiality agreements with other companies with whom the company discusses its proprietary technology  financial issues  business opportunities and other confidential matters 
despite trade secret protection  the company cannot be certain that third parties will not independently develop the same or similar technologies  or whether third parties will improperly disclose or use sonic technologies 
seasonal trends the company s software product sales have historically followed a seasonal trend  with sales being typically higher in the december and march quarters 
due to adverse global economic conditions  this normal seasonality was not pronounced during fiscal research and development the company s research and development staff is located principally at its headquarters in novato and santa clara  california  and in its offices in san luis obispo  california  wayne  pennsylvania and  in shanghai and hangzhou  china 
the company typically hires research and development personnel with backgrounds in digital audio signal processing  digital video image processing  distributed networking and computer systems design 
for information regarding research and development expenses  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report 
employees as of march   the company had approximately full time employees  a reduction of from its previous level as of march   due primarily to restructuring activities in fiscal the total consists of employees engaged in sales and marketing  engaged in research and development and the remaining engaged in general and administration 
as of march   the company had approximately employees in north america  employees in europe  and employees in asia 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  and sales and marketing personnel 
none of the employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
the company believes relations with employees are good

item a 
risk factors the following are certain risk factors that could affect the company s business  financial results and results of operations 
these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this annual report because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as those in other documents the company files with the sec 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company may face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations 
adverse global economic conditions may continue to negatively affect the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
current adverse global economic conditions has had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on consumers and limit their ability and inclination to spend on leisure and entertainment related products and services 
if demand for the company s products and services further decreases  as a result of economic conditions or otherwise  the company s financial condition would be adversely impacted 
the recent financial downturn has had and could continue to negatively affect the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the recent global economic downturn has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit and equity markets 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on the company s business  including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of company products  and increased expense or inability to obtain financing for company operations 
the company was not profitable in fiscal or fiscal  and there can be no assurance that the company will generate net income in subsequent periods 
the company experienced net losses of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will be cash flow positive or generate net income in fiscal year or future years 
rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences may adversely affect the company s operating results 
the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapid changes in technology 
the company may not accurately predict customer or business partner behavior and may not recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing preferences or competitive factors  and  therefore  the company may fail to make accurate financial forecasts 
the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside its control 
these factors include fluctuations in demand for  and sales of  the company s products and services  introduction of new products and services by the company or its competitors  competitive pressures that result in pricing fluctuations  variations in the timing of orders for and shipments of the company products  changes in the mix of products and services that the company sells and the resulting impact on its gross margins  changes in the terms of the company s licensing  distribution and other agreements  costs associated with litigation and intellectual property claims  and economic conditions as noted above in these risks 
the company s operating expenses are based on its current expectations of its future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
customer purchasing behavior can be difficult to forecast  and if the company has lower revenues than expected  the company may not be able to quickly reduce its expenses in response 
as a consequence  the company s operating results for a particular quarter could be adversely impacted  and this could in turn negatively affect the market price of its common stock 
the company must develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
to compete successfully in the markets in which the company operates  it must develop and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
as new industry standards  technologies and formats are introduced  there may be limited sources for the intellectual property rights and background technologies necessary for implementation  and the initial prices that the company may negotiate in an effort to bring its products to market may prove to be higher than those ultimately offered to other licensees  putting the company at a competitive disadvantage 
further  if new formats and technologies prove to be unsuccessful or are not accepted for any reason  there may be limited demand for the company s products 
the products and services that the company is currently developing or intends to develop may not achieve feasibility or be accepted by the market  and if the company is unable to recover the costs associated with its research and development activities  it may adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company relies on distributors  resellers and retailers to sell its products  and disruptions to these channels would affect adversely the company s ability to generate revenues from the sale of its products 
the company sells its retail consumer software to end users via retail channels through its network of distributors and resellers  and relies on two distributors for a significant portion of sales 
any decrease in revenue from these distributors or the loss of one of these distributors and the company s inability to find a satisfactory replacement in a timely manner could negatively impact its operating results adversely 
moreover  the company s failure to maintain favorable arrangements with its distributors and resellers may adversely impact its business 
for example  the company s distributors and resellers and the retailers who sell its software to the public also sell products offered by the company s competitors 
if the company s competitors offer its distributors  resellers or retailers more favorable terms  those distributors  resellers or retailers may de emphasize  fail to recommend or decline to carry the company s products 
if the company s distributors  resellers or retailers attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand  its sales could be impacted negatively 
further  if the company reduces the prices of its products  it may have to compensate its distributors  resellers or retailers for the difference between the higher price they paid to buy their inventory and the new lower prices of the company s products 
in addition  the company is exposed to the risk of product returns from distributors  resellers or retailers through their exercise of contractual return rights 
if direct sales to customers through the company s web based channels continue to increase  its distributors  resellers and retailers may suffer decreased sales as a consequence 
these changes may cause the company s distributors  resellers or retailers to cease distribution of its products or seek more favorable terms  either of which could seriously harm the company s business 
because the company s products are designed to comply with industry standards  to the extent the company cannot distinguish its products from those produced by its competitors  its current distributors and customers may choose alternate products or choose to purchase products from multiple vendors 
the company may be unable to compete effectively if it cannot produce products more quickly or at lower cost than its competitors 
the company cannot provide any assurance that the industry standards on which it develops new products will allow it to compete effectively with companies possessing greater financial and technological resources than it has to market  promote and exploit sales opportunities as they arise in the future 
products that are designed to comply with standards may be viewed as interchangeable commodities by the company s customers 
further  any new products developed may not be introduced in a timely manner or in advance of the company s competitors products and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues 
the company s business depends on sales of consumer products and services  which subject it to risks relating to  among other things  changing consumer demands and increased competition 
the company s business depends on sales of consumer products and services  subjecting it to risks associated with changing consumer demands  extensive competition  and or product warranty concerns 
the company s ability to succeed in consumer markets depends upon its ability to enhance its existing offerings  introduce new competitive products and services  and minimize the impact of sudden price decreases 
the company sells its consumer products through bundling arrangements with oem customers  through its web store  and through physical and web based retail channels 
the company may not have the resources or expertise to continue to develop and exploit these distribution channels effectively 
additionally  some of the company s non oem revenue opportunities are fragmented and take more time and effort to establish and maintain 
also  some of the company s competitors have well established retail distribution capabilities and existing brands with market acceptance that provide them with a significant competitive advantage 
if the company is not successful in overcoming these challenges  its business and results of operations may be harmed 
because a large portion of the company s revenue is from oem customers  the potential success of its products is tied to the success of their product sales 
a substantial portion of the company s revenue is derived from sales through oem customers who bundle copies of company s software with their products 
temporary fluctuations in the pricing and availability of the oem customers products could negatively impact sales of the company s products  which could in turn harm its business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  sales of the company s oem products depend in large part on consumer acceptance and purchase of dvd players  bd players  dvd recorders and other digital media devices marketed by its oem customers in pcs  ce devices  or on a stand alone basis 
consumer acceptance of these digital media devices depends significantly on the price and ease of use of these devices  among other factors 
if the demand for these devices is impaired  the company s oem sales will suffer a corresponding decline 
in addition  the company relies on reports prepared by oem customers to determine the results of its sales of products through these oem customers 
if the oem customers prepare inaccurate or substandard sales reports  the company may be required to take corrective actions  including auditing current and prior reports 
such corrective actions may result in a negative impact on the company s business or its reported results 
changes in requirements or business models of the company s oem customers may affect negatively its financial results 
oem customers can be quite demanding with respect to the features they demand in software products they bundle  quality and testing requirements  and economic terms 
because there are a relatively small number of significant oem customers  if they demand reduced prices for company products  the company may not be in a position to refuse such demands  which would damage its revenues and results of operations 
if particular oems demand certain products or product features that the company is unable to deliver  or if they impose higher quality requirements than the company is able to satisfy  the company could lose those relationships  which likely would damage its revenues and its results of operations 
also  if the company s competitors offer its oem customers more favorable terms than it does or if its competitors are able to take advantage of their existing relationships with these oems  then these oems may not include the company s software with their products 
the company s business will suffer if it is unable to maintain or expand its relationships with oems 
the company depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenue  and the loss of one or more of these customers could materially harm its operating results  business and financial condition 
during the fiscal year ended march   approximately and of the company s net revenue was derived from revenue received from dell and hewlett packard  respectively  and approximately and of its net revenue for fiscal was derived from revenue received from its two largest distributors  ingram and navarre  respectively 
in addition  during fiscal  approximately of the company s net revenue was derived from online web store revenue received through digital river 
the company anticipates that the relationships with dell  hewlett packard  ingram  navarre and digital river will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue in the future 
any changes in the company s relationships with any of these companies could seriously harm its operating results  business  and financial condition 
the company s web based revenue is vulnerable to third party operational problems and other risks 
the company currently makes its products and services available through web based retail sites operated by third party resellers 
under these arrangements  the company s reseller partners typically utilize co branded sites  provide the infrastructure to handle purchase transactions through their secure web sites  and deliver the product whether via web download or physical fulfillment 
the company s web store operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems  diversion of sales from other channels  rapid technological change  liability for online content  credit card fraud  and issues relating to the use and protection of customer information 
the company relies on the third party resellers who operate these web stores for their smooth operation 
any interruption of these web stores could have a negative effect on the company s business 
if the company s web store resellers were to withdraw from this business or change their terms of service in ways that were unfavorable to the company  there might not be a ready alternative outsourcing organization available to the company  and it might be unprepared to assume operation of the web stores 
if any of these events occurs  the company s results of operations would be harmed 
changes in the company s product and service offerings could cause it to defer the recognition of revenue  which could harm its operating results and adversely impact its ability to forecast revenue 
the company s products contain advanced features and functionality that may require it to provide increased levels of end user support  and the company s services require the company to continue to provide various benefits during the applicable service terms 
to the extent that the company offers a greater degree of end user support and ongoing services  it may be required to defer a greater percentage of its revenues into future periods  which could harm its short term operating results 
the company s reliance on a limited number of suppliers for its manufacturing makes it vulnerable to supplier operational problems 
the company outsources the manufacturing of its consumer software products primarily to hp software publishing 
hp software publishing provides services such as parts procurement  parts warehousing  product assembly and supply chain services from two primary locations andover  massachusetts  servicing north america  and galway  ireland  servicing europe 
production services and supply chain logistics for asia and the pacific rim are provided by moduslink  taipei 
any disruption in the operations of these suppliers  or any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacturing and distributing the company s products and could adversely impact its operating results 
moreover  if these suppliers ceased to perform or fail to perform as the company expects  the company could face difficulty in engaging substitute suppliers in a timely manner or at all or under terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
the company s product prices may decline  which could harm its operating results 
the market for the company s software is intensely competitive 
it is likely that prices for its oem products  particularly in the dvd area  will decline due to competitive pricing pressures from other software providers  competition in the pc and ce industries and continuing concentration among oem customers 
in addition  the company now derives a substantial portion of its revenue from retail sales  which also are subject to significant competitive pricing pressures 
the company may also experience pricing pressures in other parts of its business 
these trends could make it more difficult for the company to increase or maintain its revenue and may cause it to incur increasing losses 
qualifying and supporting the company s products on multiple computer platforms is time consuming and expensive 
the company devotes significant time and resources to qualify and support its software products on various computer platforms  including microsoft and apple operating systems 
to the extent that any qualified and supported platform is modified or upgraded  or it needs to qualify and support a new platform  the company could be required to expend additional engineering time and resources  which could add significantly to its development expenses and adversely affect its operating results 
the company may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute its existing shareholders ownership and harm its business  results of operations and financial condition 
as part of the company s efforts to enhance its existing products and services  introduce new products and services  grow its business and remain competitive  the company has pursued  and it may continue to pursue acquisitions of companies  products and technologies 
the company cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired businesses into its current operations  or expand into new markets 
in addition  the integration of a new business into the company s existing business is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
if company s management is unable to minimize the potential disruption to its business during the integration process  the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized 
realizing the benefits of an acquisition depends in part on integrating technology  operations and personnel while maintaining focus on existing business 
the company may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays in integrating various acquisitions 
as a consequence  acquisitions by the company could result in the following  any of which could seriously harm its results of operations  business  financial condition and or the price of its stock potential conflicts between business cultures  and difficulties and delays in the assimilation and integration of operations  personnel  technologies  products  services  business relationships and information and other systems of the acquired businesses  the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  issuance of equity securities that would dilute the company s current shareholders percentages of ownership  large one time write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  contractual and or intellectual property disputes  undiscovered and unknown problems  defects or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to the company only after the acquisition  potential conflicts in distribution  marketing or other important relationships  or poor acceptance by the company s resellers  difficulties caused by entering geographic and business markets in which the company has no or only limited prior experience  acquired product and services may not attract consumers and other end users  potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses and disruptions among employees that may erode employee morale  inability to implement uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  the failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenue  profitability or productivity  and poor acceptance of the company s business model and strategies 
the company s failure to manage its global operations effectively may adversely affect its business and operating results 
as of march   the company had four major locations defined as a location with more than employees and employed approximately employees outside the united states 
the company s management team faces challenges inherent in efficiently managing employees over large geographic distances  including the need to implement appropriate systems  controls  policies  benefits and compliance programs 
the company s inability to successfully manage its global organization could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations and  as a result  on the market price of its common stock 
the company is subject to risks associated with its international operations 
revenue derived from international customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the occurrence of adverse international political  economic or geographic events could result in significant revenue shortfalls  which could harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s international operations expose it to additional risks  including  but not limited to import and export restrictions and duties  including tariffs  quotas  and other barriers  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  foreign regulatory requirements  such as safety or radio frequency emissions regulations  liquidity problems in various foreign markets  uncertainties and liabilities associated with foreign tax laws  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  including more stringent consumer and data protection laws  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  foreign legislative or regulatory requirements  difficulties in coordinating the activities of its geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations  difficulties in staffing  managing  and operating its international operations  potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of the company s intellectual property rights than us law  political and economic instability  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and other factors beyond its control including terrorism  war  natural disasters and diseases  particularly in areas in which it has facilities 
certain political  economic and social considerations relating to china could adversely affect the company 
in addition to other risks associated with its global business  the company faces risks due to the substantial operations it conducts in china  which could be adversely affected by political  economic and social uncertainties in china 
the economic reforms in china in recent years are regarded by china s central government as a way to introduce economic market forces into china 
however  given the desire of the central government leadership to maintain stability in china amid rapid social and economic changes  economic market reforms of recent years could be slowed  or even reversed 
in addition  many of the laws and regulations impacting the company in china are relatively new  the chinese legal system is still evolving  the interpretation of laws and regulations is not always uniform and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties  all of which may limit the remedies available in the event of any claims or disputes with third parties 
revenues derived from the company s consumer dvd products have declined in recent years and may continue to decline 
the company has experienced declines in consumer products revenue  and absent the introduction and market acceptance of new formats such as bd or new business and service models  the company expects such declines to continue 
with the growth in the internet software sales  the company expects to face increasing competition from smaller software providers 
the increasing popularity of the internet is enabling smaller software providers to distribute products with minimal upfront costs or resources 
in the past  a substantial barrier to entry into the packaged software market for small scale providers has been the need to manufacture  package and distribute software through a retail or commercial distribution chain 
to the extent consumers increasingly purchase software over the internet  the company expects to face increased competition from small software development companies and programmers worldwide 
new entrants that have business models focused on internet distribution may have more favorable cost structures than the companies that employ a multi channel distribution network  which could give those competitors cost savings  pricing and profitability advantages 
the company has had limited experience with online premium content services  and cannot assure you when or if its new cinemanow service will have a positive impact on the company s profitability 
during fiscal  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of cinemanow  inc  an online movie download and streaming business 
there is no assurance that consumers will widely adopt its online movie service offerings or that it will become profitable 
the company has invested  and will continue to invest  significant time and money in building the premium content business  and the company s success could be jeopardized by difficulties in implementing and maintaining premium content information technology systems and infrastructure and or by increased operating expenses and capital expenditures required to in connection with online premium content offerings 
because the company has limited experience with online premium content offerings  it cannot assure you that it will be successful or profitable 
the company depends on studios to license its content for its cinemanow service 
the company s ability to provide its cinemanow service depends on studios licensing content for internet delivery 
the studios have great discretion in whether to license their content  and the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary by studio 
if the studios change their terms and conditions  are no longer willing or able to provide the company licenses  or if the company is otherwise unable to obtain premium content on terms that are acceptable  the ability to provide the cinemanow service to the company s customers will be adversely affected  which could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
the company relies on a number of third parties to deliver its cinemanow service 
the company offers its cinemanow service through various pc and ce platforms and devices 
if the company isn t successful in creating appropriate distribution relationships with third parties  or if the company encounters technological  content licensing or other impediments  the company s ability to grow its cinemanow service could be adversely impacted  which could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
if the company s customers select titles or formats that are more expensive for the company to acquire and deliver more frequently  the company s expenses may increase 
certain titles cost the company more to acquire or result in greater revenue sharing expenses 
if customers select these titles more often on a proportional basis compared to all titles selected  the company s costs and margins could be adversely affected 
in addition  films released in high definition formats such as bd may be more expensive for the company to acquire and deliver  and if customers select these formats on a proportional basis more often than the existing standard definition formats  the company s costs and margins could be adversely affected 
the company could be liable for substantial damages if there is unauthorized duplication of the content it sells 
the company believes that it is able to license premium content through its cinemanow service in part because the service has been designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized duplication and playback of this content 
if these security measures fail  studios and other content providers may terminate their agreements with the company and  in addition  the company could be liable for substantial damages 
security breaches might also discourage other content providers from entering into agreements with the company 
the company may be required to expend substantial money and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
the company s executive officers and other key personnel are critical to its business  and because there is significant competition for personnel in the company s industry  it may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the company s success depends on the continued contributions of its executive management team  its technical  marketing  sales  customer support and product development personnel 
the loss of key individuals or significant numbers of such personnel could significantly harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not have any life insurance or other insurance covering the loss of any of its key employees 
some of the company s competitors possess greater technological and financial resources  may produce better or more cost effective products or services and may be more effective than the company  in marketing and promoting their products and services 
there is a substantial risk that competing companies will produce better or more cost effective products or services  or will be better equipped than the company  to promote products or services in the marketplace 
a number of companies offer products and services that compete with the company s products  either directly or indirectly 
many of these companies have greater financial and technological resources than the company 
undetected errors found in company products and services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could seriously harm the company s reputation and business 
the company s products and services may contain undetected errors  especially when first introduced or as new versions are released  and the company may need to modify significantly its products or services to correct these errors 
failure to achieve acceptance could result in a delay in  or inability to  receive payment 
the company s products and services may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun or services rendered  which could result in the rejection of its products and damage to its reputation  as well as lost revenues  diverted development resources  increased service and warranty costs and related litigation expenses and potential liability to third parties  any of which could harm its business 
the company is vulnerable to earthquakes  labor issues and other unexpected events 
the company s corporate headquarters  as well as the majority of its research and development activities  are located in california and china  both of which are areas known for seismic activity 
an earthquake or other disaster could result in an interruption in company business 
the company s business also may be impacted by labor issues related to its operations and or those of its suppliers  distributors or customers 
such an interruption could harm the company s operating results 
the company is not likely to have sufficient insurance to compensate adequately for losses that it may sustain as a result of any natural disasters or other unexpected events 
if the company fails to protect its intellectual property rights it may not be able to market its products and services successfully 
unlicensed copying and use of the company s intellectual property or illegal infringements of its intellectual property rights represent losses of revenue to the company 
the company s products and services are based in large part on proprietary technology  which it has sought to protect with patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which the company s products and services may be manufactured  marketed  distributed  sold or used 
moreover  despite the company s efforts  these measures only provide limited protection 
third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of the company s products or services or otherwise obtain and use its intellectual property without authorization 
the company cannot assure you that the protection of its proprietary rights will be adequate or that its competitors will not develop independently similar technology  duplicate the company s products or services or design around any of its patents or other intellectual property rights 
the company may become involved in costly and time consuming patent litigation 
third parties could claim that the company s products or services infringe their patents 
as new standards and technologies evolve  the company  it believes that it may face an increasing number of third party claims relating to patent infringements and potential patent infringements over time 
patent infringement litigation can be time consuming and costly  may divert management resources and could result in the invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights 
if such litigation resulted in an unfavorable outcome for the company  it could be subject to substantial damage claims and or be required to cease production of infringing products  terminate its use of the infringing technology  develop non infringing technology and or obtain a license agreement to continue using the technology at issue 
such license agreements might not be available to the company on acceptable terms  resulting in serious harm to its business 
the company s use of technology asserted to be infringing could result in liability that could adversely affect its ability to continue its operations as currently structured 
the company may be liable to some of its customers for damages that they incur in connection with intellectual property claims 
although the company attempts to limit its exposure to liability arising from infringement of third party intellectual property rights in company license agreements with customers  the company does not always succeed in obtaining the limitations it seeks 
if the company is required to pay damages to or incur liability on behalf of its customers  its business could be harmed 
moreover  even if a particular claim falls outside of the company s indemnity or warranty obligations to its customers  its customers may be entitled to additional contractual remedies against the company  which could harm its business 
furthermore  even if the company was not liable to its customers  its customers may stop buying company products or attempt to pass on to the company the cost of any license fees or damages owed to third parties by reducing the amounts they pay for its products 
any of these results could harm its business 
the company may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not effectively reduce its exposure 
the company s operating results are subject to volatility resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  including currency movements in which the us dollar becomes stronger with respect to foreign currencies  thereby reducing relative demand for its products and services outside the united states  and currency movements in which a foreign currency in which the company has incurred expenses becomes stronger in relation to the us dollar  thereby raising the company s expenses for the same level of operating activity 
the company s stock price has been volatile  is likely to continue to be volatile  and could decline substantially 
the price of the company s common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the price of its common stock could fluctuate significantly for any of the following reasons  among others fluctuations in the us or world economy or general market conditions  as well as those specific to specific to the pc  ce and related industries  future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  earnings announcements  quarterly variations in operating results  including variations due to one time payments and other non recurring revenues that may result from certain customer relationships  as well as variations due to the timing of revenue recognition  including deferrals of revenue  charges  amortization and other financial effects relating to any future acquisitions or divestitures  introduction of new products or services or changes in product or service pricing policies by the company or its competitors  or the entry of new competitors into the digital media software markets  acquisition or loss of significant customers  distributors or suppliers  changes in earnings estimates by the company or by independent analysts who cover it  delay in delivery to market or acceptance of new products and services  disclosure of material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting or its disclosure controls and procedures or of other corporate governance issues  and or costs of litigation and intellectual property claims 
in addition  stock markets in general  and those for technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years  which frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
these broad market fluctuations may impact adversely the market price of the company s common stock 
the current volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets may continue to exert downward pressure on the company s stock price and the company may cease to be in compliance with the continued listing standards set forth by nasdaq 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than twelve months 
stock markets in general and the company s stock prices in particular  have experienced significant price and volume volatility over the past year 
although nasdaq has suspended the enforcement of rules requiring a minimum closing bid price and the rules requiring a minimum market value of publicly held shares  this suspension is temporary 
there is no guarantee that the company will be in compliance with nasdaq s continued listing requirements when this suspension is lifted 
if the company s stock trades below per share after the temporary suspension is lifted  nasdaq may commence delisting procedures against the company 
if the company were delisted  the market liquidity of its common stock could be adversely affected and the market price of its common stock could decrease 
a delisting could also adversely affect the company s ability to obtain financing for the continuation of its operations and could result in a loss of confidence by investors  suppliers and employees

the company makes provisions for legal proceedings as appropriate 
these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and other information and events pertaining to particular cases 
litigation is inherently unpredictable 
however  the company believes that its has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it 
nevertheless  it is possible  that the company s consolidated financial position  cash flows or results of operations could be affected by the resolution of one or more of such matters

the company accrues for known indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
historically  costs related to these indemnifications have not been significant  but because potential future costs are highly variable  the company is unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnifications on its future results of operations

in those cases where the company is not the primary obligor or merchant of record and or does not bear credit risk  or where it earns a fixed transactional fee  the company records revenue under the net method 
when the company records revenues at net  revenue is reported at the net amount received and retained by the company 
multiple element arrangements in arrangements that include multiple elements eg  software  specified upgrades  support services  installation services  and or training  the company allocates the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement to the elements based on their relative fair value  as determined by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 
vsoe is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately or  in the case of support services  annual renewal rates

in accordance with sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 long lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite useful lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

the provision for income taxes is calculated using the liability method of accounting 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in assessing net deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
when the company does not believe realization of a deferred tax asset is likely  it records a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is evaluated at the end of each year  considering positive and negative evidence about whether the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company is subject to income taxes in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes

 an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

fin no 
contains a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions as well as related interest and penalties
