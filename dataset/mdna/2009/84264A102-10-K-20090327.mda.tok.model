critical accounting policy in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to reporting the results of operations and financial condition in preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following discussion addresses the company s only critical accounting policy  which is the policy that is most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company has reviewed this critical accounting policy and estimates with its audit committee 
refer to the discussion below under allowance for loan losses and note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to allowances established for individual impaired loans 
the general component relates to pools of loans segregated by loan type  and is based on historical loss experience adjusted by certain qualitative factors as determined by management and the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses does not contain an unallocated component 
based upon this evaluation  management believes the allowance for loan losses of  or of gross loans at december  is adequate  under prevailing economic conditions  to absorb losses on existing loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was  or of gross loans outstanding 
the decrease in the allowance is attributable to a  increase in the general component of the allowance due to loan growth as well as an increase in the reserve factors for the general portion of the allowance  offset by a  decline in the specific component of the allowance 
the decrease in the specific component is due to lower specific reserves needed for new impaired loans at december  as compared to the reserves that were needed for loans that were impaired at december  based on prevailing nationwide economic conditions and forecasts  management and the board of directors determined to increase the reserve factors for the company s general reserve components of the allowance 
the accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued whenever reasonable doubt exists as to its collectibility and generally is discontinued when loans are past due days as to either principal or interest  or are otherwise considered impaired 
when the accrual of interest income is discontinued  all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income 
the accrual of interest on loans past due days or more may be continued if the loan is well secured  and it is believed all principal and accrued interest income due on the loan will be realized  and the loan is in the process of collection 
a non accrual loan is restored to an accrual status when it is no longer delinquent and collectibility of interest and principal is no longer in doubt 
management considers all non accrual loans and restructured loans to be impaired 
in most cases  loan payments that are past due less than days and the related loans are not considered to be impaired 
allowance for loan losses and non accrual  past due and restructured loans balance  beginning of year provision for loan losses recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial consumer total recoveries loans charged off commercial loans secured by real estate commercial total charge offs balance  end of year net charge offs recoveries to average loans allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december and percent of percent of loans in each loans in each category to category to balance total loans balance total loans commercial loans secured by real estate commercial loans construction loans residential mortgages consumer home equity loans consumer installment loans non accrual  past due and restructured loans non accrual loans at december  and totaled  and  respectively

accruing loans contractually past due days or more were  and  at december  and  respectively 
december  december  non accrual loans accruing loans contractually past due days or more loans past due days or more and still accruing matured loans pending renewal and still accruing total in november  the company significantly revamped it s underwriting procedures  including  among other items  a revised process for renewing matured loans 
the bank is in the process of completing negotiations of terms for the matured loans 
each of these loans is making timely payments as to interest since the date of maturity 
potential problem loans at december   the bank had loans totaling million  which were not disclosed in the table above  and were not on non accrual status  but were deemed to be impaired pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
the loans were current with respect to principal and interest 
management of the company has reviewed the collateral for the loans and considers the current specific reserves  if any  on the loans to be adequate to cover potential losses related to the relationships 
deposits total deposits were million at december   a decrease of million in comparison to total deposits as of december  of million 
million of the decrease in deposits from december  is attributable to the sale of the new london branch completed on february  following is a discussion of the million decrease in total deposits in excluding the aforementioned million in deposits held for sale at december  non interest bearing deposits were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  the balance of interest bearing checking accounts can fluctuate as much as to on a daily basis 
total interest bearing checking  money market and savings decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  time deposits increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase 
included in time deposits is the company s placement of million in customer deposits and purchase of million in brokered certificates of deposit through the cdars program 
the bank continues to emphasize growth in core non interest checking accounts and related interest bearing checking  money market deposit  and savings accounts and is less aggressive in attracting higher cost time deposits 
as of december   these core deposits represented of total deposits 
the bank maintains relationships with several deposit brokers and could continue to utilize the services of one or more of such brokers if management determines that issuing brokered certificates of deposits would be in the best interest of the bank and the company 
the greater new haven market is highly competitive 
the bank faces competition from a large number of banks ranging from small community banks to large international banks  credit unions  and other providers of financial services 
the level of rates offered by the bank reflects the high level of competition in our market 
as of december  the bank s maturities of time deposits were less than or greater totals thousands of dollars three months or less over three months to six months over six months to one year over one year to two years over two years to three years over three years other the decrease in premises and equipment of  is due mainly to the sale of assets related to the new london branch of  the decrease in other assets held for sale is due to the write down of the clinton property 
the property is recorded at fair market value  net of estimated costs to sell  of  as of december  the following table presents average balance sheets daily averages  interest income  interest expense  and the corresponding annualized rates on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and distribution of assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  interest rates and interest differential interest interest decreases average income average average income average in interest dollars in thousands balance expense rate balance expense rate income expense interest earning assets loans short term and other investments investments federal funds sold total interest earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment  net allowance for loan losses other total assets interest bearing liabilities time certificates savings deposits money market checking deposits capital lease obligations repurchase agreements total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing deposits accrued expenses and other liabilities shareholder s equity total liabilities and equity net interest income interest spread interest margin includes nonaccruing loans 
rate volume variance analysis the following table summarizes the variance in interest income and expense for and resulting from changes in assets and liabilities and fluctuations in interest rates earned and paid 
the changes in interest income and expense attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated to both rate and volume on a pro rata basis 
vs variance due to dollars in thousands volume rate total interest earning assets loans short term and other investments investments federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities time certificates savings deposits money market checking deposits capital lease obligations repurchase agreements total interest bearing liabilities net interest income the decrease in net interest income during reflects the decrease in the yields on earning assets from in to in and the decrease in total average interest earning asset balances from  as the average earning assets in of million were lower than average earning assets of million in the decline in interest income attributable to average interest earning assets was partially offset by the decrease in rates on interest bearing liabilities from in to in and a million decrease in average interest bearing liabilities from million in to million in overall  interest income attributed to volume decreases was  versus a decrease of  due to the decrease in interest rates 
interest income from interest earning assets in compared to declined million due to rates and decreased  due to volume 
variances in the cost of interest bearing liabilities in comparison to were due to decreased rate considerations of  combined with decreased volume considerations of  the company intends for the bank to continue to emphasize lending to small to medium sized businesses in its market area as its strategy to increase assets under management and to improve earnings 
the bank will seek opportunities through marketing to increase its deposit base  with a primary objective of attracting core non interest checking and related money market deposit accounts  in order to support its earning assets and also by considering additional branch locations and new product and service offerings 
the following are measurements of the company s results of operations in relation to assets and equity  and average equity to average assets for the years ended december  and income loss on average assets income loss on average equity average equity to average assets results of operations the company s net income for fiscal year was  an improvement of  from the net loss of  in fiscal year in comparison to  the improvement in operating results is due to a combination of factors  including increased earnings of  from the sale of the new london branch  a decrease in the provision for loan losses of  and a decrease in noninterest expenses of  due to the sale of the new london branch and reductions in professional services  offset by severance payments to the former chief executive officer and president of the bank 
additional factors were a decline in net interest income of million  attributable to decreases in average earning assets liabilities previously discussed  and decreases in noninterest income of  related to lower levels of service charges  sba loan servicing income and rental income  as well as revenues from sales of the guaranteed portion of sba originated loans 
net interest income the principal source of revenue for the bank is net interest income 
the bank s net interest income is dependent primarily upon the difference or spread between the average yield earned on loans receivable and securities and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings  as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
the bank  like other banking institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different times  or on a different basis  than its interest earning assets 
the federal open market committee fomc reduced short term interest rates which resulted in a corresponding reduction in the prime lending rate from at december  to at december  decreases in short term rates tend to compress the company s net interest spread and net interest margin 
during periods of declining interest rates  the interest expense related to sources of funds is not reduced commensurate with reduction in interest earned on interest earning assets which are most typically tied to the prime lending rate or other market indices 
this situation inherently compresses the spread during periods of declining interest rates 
for the year ended december   net interest income was  versus  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily the result of decreases in rates and volume on interest earning assets which exceeded the rate and volume decreases on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s average total interest earning assets decreased for the year ended december  to million a decrease of million from the company s average total interest earning assets of million for the year ended december  the decrease in average interest earning assets of million was comprised of increases in average balance of loans of million  decreases in average balance of investments of million  increases in average balance of short term and other investments of million  and decreases in average balance of federal funds sold of million 
the yield on average interest earning assets for the year ended december  was versus for  a decrease of basis points 
the decrease in the yield on assets reflects the decreases in market interest rates that occurred throughout  particularly in the prime lending rate and the bank s base lending rate and the increasing competitive market to attract new loans 
the cost of average interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december  versus for  a decrease of basis points  reflecting a general decrease in market interest rates 
due to decreases in the average yields on earning assets  in excess of the decreases in rates on interest bearing liabilities  the interest spread decreased to for  a decrease of basis points from the interest spread realized in the net interest margin decreased to in from in  a decrease of basis points that largely reflects the decreasing short term yields on interest earning assets during provision for loan losses the company s provision for loan losses was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the change is primarily attributable to the favorable reclassification of an impaired loan and a net increase in loans receivable 
noninterest income total noninterest income was  for the year ended december  versus  for the same period in noninterest income in included  from a gain on sale of the bank s new london branch 
service charges and fees decreased  due to changes in business practices of customers of the bank 
gains on sales of sba loans decreased  during other noninterest income decreased from  in to  in principally due to decreases in rental income  and sba loan servicing income 
noninterest expenses total noninterest expenses were  for the year ended december  versus  for the same period in  a decrease of  or 
salaries and benefits expense for the year ended december  was  versus  for the same period in salaries and benefits expense increased  in primarily due to expenses related to the severance of the former chief executive officer and president of the bank  the addition of evergreen employees and the accrual and payment of employee related benefits and performance bonuses 
the increases were offset by expense savings related to a reduction in staff implemented in july  and the sale of the new london branch 
occupancy and equipment expense for decreased by  or 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the elimination of expenses related to the operation of the new london branch 
fdic insurance expense decreased by  from  to  due to a lower assessment rate as a result of an improved fdic rating 
in addition  professional services decreased  the result of lower legal costs  consulting fees and expenses related to the company s implementation of the sarbanes oxley act 
other operating expenses decreased by  to  largely as a result of the accrual of  in related to post retirement benefits with the retired chairman of the board of directors 
this accrual reflects the changing nature of a consulting agreement from a consulting agreement to a post retirement benefit  as a result of the former chairman retiring from his position as a director of the company as of december  off balance sheet arrangements see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for required disclosure regarding off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity the company s liquidity position as of december  and december  consisted of liquid assets totaling million and million  respectively 
this represents and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
the liquidity ratio is defined as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets 
the following categories of assets as described in the accompanying balance sheet are considered liquid assets cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  short term investments  interest bearing certificates of deposit and securities available for sale 
liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to generate adequate cash to meet financial obligations 
the principal cash requirements of a financial institution are to cover downward fluctuations in deposits and increases in its loan portfolio 
management believes the company s short term assets provide sufficient liquidity to cover potential fluctuations in deposit accounts and loan demand and to meet other anticipated operating cash and investment requirements 
capital the following table illustrates the company s and the bank s regulatory capital ratios at december company bank capital capital adequacy adequacy target ratio target ratio total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage capital ratio to average assets capital adequacy is one of the most important factors used to determine the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system 
based on the above ratios  the bank is considered to be well capitalized under applicable regulations 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must generally have a leverage capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
market risk market risk is defined as the sensitivity of income to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other market driven rates or prices 
based upon the nature of the company s business  market risk is primarily limited to interest rate risk  which is defined as the impact of changing interest rates on current and future earnings 
the company s goal is to maximize long term profitability  while minimizing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the first priority is to structure and price the company s assets and liabilities to maintain an acceptable interest rate spread  while reducing the net effect of changes in interest rates 
in order to reach an acceptable interest rate spread  the company must generate loans and seek acceptable long term investments to replace the lower yielding balances in federal funds sold and short term investments 
the focus also must be on maintaining a proper balance between the timing and volume of assets and liabilities re pricing within the balance sheet 
one method of achieving this balance is to originate variable loans for the portfolio to offset the short term re pricing of the liabilities 
in fact  a number of the interest bearing deposit products have no contractual maturity 
customers may withdraw funds from their accounts at any time and deposits balances may therefore run off unexpectedly due to changing market conditions 
the exposure to interest rate risk is monitored by senior management of the bank and reported quarterly to the asset and liability management committee and the board of directors 
management reviews the interrelationships within the balance sheet to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this fact  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular  real estate 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect the company s earnings in future periods 
factors affecting future results some of the statements under management s discussion and analysis or plan of operations  business and elsewhere in this annual report on form k may include forward looking statements which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
statements which include the words expect  intend  plan  believe  project  anticipate and similar statements of a future or forward looking nature identify forward looking statements for purposes of the federal securities laws or otherwise 
all forward looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties 
accordingly  there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements or that could adversely affect the holders of our common stock 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in prevailing interest rates which would affect the interest earned on the company s interest earning assets and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the timing of re pricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the effect of changes in governmental monetary policy  the effect of changes in regulations applicable to the company and the conduct of its business  changes in competition among financial service companies  including possible further encroachment of non banks on services traditionally provided by banks and the impact of recently enacted federal legislation  the ability of competitors which are larger than the company to provide products and services which it is impractical for the company to provide  the volatility of quarterly earnings  due in part to the variation in the number  dollar volume and profit realized from sba guaranteed loan participation sales in different quarters  the effect of a loss of any executive officer  key personnel  or directors  the effect of the company s opening of branches and the receipt of regulatory approval to complete such actions  concentration of the company s business in southern and southeastern connecticut  the concentration of the company s loan portfolio in commercial loans to small to medium sized businesses  which may be impacted more severely than larger businesses during periods of economic weakness  lack of seasoning in the company s loan portfolio  which may increase the risk of future credit defaults  and the effect of any decision by the company to engage in any business not historically permitted to it 
other such factors may be described in other filings made by the company with the sec 
although the company believes that it has the resources needed for success  future revenues and interest spreads and yields cannot be reliably predicted 
these trends may cause the company to adjust its operations in the future 
because of the foregoing and other factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future financial results or stock prices
