achieving best cost allows the company to improve its competitive position  generate funds for increased investment in strategic brand building initiatives  and preserve cash and liquidity in the midst of volatile commodity and currency markets and the current global economic slowdown 
market overview the company operates in the consumer and commercial products markets  which are generally impacted by overall economic conditions in the regions in which the company operates 
during  the company s results were impacted by the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions  significant inflation  a volatile currency environment  instability in the credit markets  and disruption of global equity markets 
these factors  combined with rising unemployment levels and the contraction of consumer credit markets  adversely impacted consumer confidence leading to reductions in consumer spending 
the company s results were impacted as follows the inflationary commodity environment and volatile currency environment led to significant year over year inflation in raw materials  including resin  and sourced finished goods 
the primary drivers for the increases were record high energy prices  including the price of oil and natural gas  and currency volatility on sourced products 
the record high energy prices contributed to increases in transportation costs and the cost of resin  since oil and natural gas are key inputs in the production and cost of certain types of resin 
for  inflation adversely impacted year over year gross margins by approximately million 

table of contents as consumer confidence waned  the company experienced pressure on its sales  particularly in the fourth quarter of  across all businesses and geographies since consumer spending declined and retailers responded by tightly managing inventory levels 
declines in residential and commercial construction markets contributed to sales declines in the tools hardware segment and the d cor business 
an estimated million housing units were started in compared to million housing units started in  and existing home sales declined from million units in to million units in in response to these market conditions  the company took the following actions expanded project acceleration  the company s restructuring initiative  to include the divestiture  rationalization  or exit of selected low margin  commodity like  and resin intensive product categories  to create a more focused and more profitable platform for growth by reducing the company s exposure to volatile commodity markets and raw material inflation 
implemented pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures experienced across multiple product lines in  particularly those where resin is the primary cost of products  including quarterly price adjustment mechanisms to adjust prices to reflect actual changes in raw material  processing and transportation costs 
these price increases offset a portion of the input cost inflation experienced in managed working capital to maximize cash flow  with a particular focus on lowering receivables days sales outstanding and inventory levels  including accelerating sku rationalization efforts 
continued to optimize the cost structure of the business by reducing and streamlining structural costs  which included initiating salaried work force reductions  freezing wages and salaries  reducing the number of global business units from to  and consolidating the segment structure from four to three segments for this allowed the company to continue to invest in brand building and product development  gaining valuable consumer insight  delivering innovative new products  expanding the company s leading brands into near neighbor product categories and new geographic regions  and acquiring businesses with consumer meaningful brands with differentiated products in global categories  including aprica and technical concepts

as of december   the company had million of debt obligations payable within one year  substantially all of which matures in september and december the company plans to address these obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements  however  access to the capital markets or successful negotiation of other arrangements cannot be assured 
ongoing initiatives through the project acceleration restructuring program and other initiatives  the company has made significant progress in improving capacity utilization rates to deliver productivity savings and increasing the use of strategic sourcing partners 
in order to achieve logistical excellence and optimize its geographic footprint  the company continues to evaluate its supply chain to identify opportunities to realize efficiencies in purchasing  distribution and transportation

cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  and the company had million available for borrowing under its syndicated revolving credit facility the revolver 
working capital at december  was million compared to million at december   and the current ratio at december  was compared to at december  the increase in working capital and the current ratio is primarily due to the repayment of current maturities of long term debt and commercial paper during with proceeds from the term loan 
the company monitors its overall capitalization by evaluating total debt to total capitalization 
total debt to total capital capitalization is defined as the sum of short and long term debt  less cash  divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders equity  less cash 
total debt to total capitalization was 
at december  and 
at december  the company s debt to total capitalization in was adversely impacted by the performance of the company s pension plan assets in  fluctuations in foreign currency  borrowings to fund the acquisitions of aprica and technical concepts  and the net loss recorded in which was primarily attributable to the impairment charges totaling million 
over the long term  the company plans to improve its current ratio and total debt to total capitalization by improving operating results  managing working capital and using cash generated from operations to repay certain debt maturities 
in addition  the company reduced the dividend payable on its common stock by 
borrowing arrangements the company s revolver expires in november as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver  and the company had million available for borrowing 
in lieu of borrowings under the revolver  the company may issue up to million of commercial paper 
the revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper 
accordingly  commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the revolver 
however  the company s current short term debt credit ratings  coupled with turmoil in the credit markets  may preclude it from accessing the commercial paper market 
the revolver also provides for the issuance of up to million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the revolver 
there was no commercial paper outstanding at december   and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the revolver 
the company has several covenants under its revolver and term loan facilities  two of which are interest coverage and debt to total capitalization 
as of december   the company had complied with all covenants under the facilities and had sufficiently exceeded the requirements for both the interest coverage and debt to total capitalization covenants 
a failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the company s ability to borrow under the revolver and term loan 
debt the company s objective is to finance the business through the appropriate mix of short term and long term debt 
the company has varying needs for short term working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business 
the volume and timing of production impacts the company s cash flows and involves increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased 
table of contents customer demand through the remainder of the year 
working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through the commercial paper markets in the us  which is supported by the revolver 
however  access to the commercial paper market cannot be assured with the company s current short term debt credit ratings and  therefore  the company may be required to access the revolver for future working capital needs 
total debt increased million to billion as of december  from billion as of december  the increase in resulted from the issuance of million of senior unsecured notes in march and million borrowed pursuant to the term loan  offset by the repayment of million of medium term notes and million of commercial paper 
the december  debt balance was also affected by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record the fair value of interest rate hedges of fixed rate debt  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  as amended 
the mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of debt by million in compared to as of december   the company had million of short term debt  including a floating rate note of million related to its receivables facility that matures in september  a million principal payment on the term loan due in september  and million of medium term notes that mature in december the company plans to address these obligations through the capital markets or other arrangements  however  access to the capital markets cannot be assured  particularly in light of the recent turmoil and uncertainty in the global credit markets  the february downgrade by moody s and standard poor s of the company s credit ratings to the lowest rating considered investment grade  and alternative financing arrangements may result in higher borrowing costs for the company 
pension obligations the company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the us and in various other countries 
the company s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets 
in  total contributions to all of the company s pension plans totaled approximately million 
during  the company s primary us defined benefit pension plan moved from a near fully funded status to an approximate million underfunded status  driven by a decrease in the value of plan assets 
because of this situation  the company currently expects to make contributions to its primary us defined benefit pension plan of approximately to million in  which is in addition to the million of contributions expected to be made to the company s other pension plans in future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
the company determines its plan asset investment mix  in part  on the duration of each plan s liabilities 
across all plans  at december   approximately of assets are invested in equities  in fixed income investments  in cash and in other investments 
to the extent each plan s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company  the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate 
dividends in january  the company reduced the quarterly dividend payable on its common stock from per share to per share 
the company currently expects to maintain this dividend rate throughout  however  the payment of dividends to holders of the company s common stock remains at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the company s financial condition  earnings  legal requirements and other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
credit ratings the company s credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies 
in february  moody s investors service downgraded the company s long term debt rating from baa to baa and its short term debt rating from p to p  and standard poor s downgraded the company s long term rating from bbb to bbb and its short term debt rating from a to a both moody s and standard poor s reaffirmed their negative outlook 
the company s current senior debt credit ratings from moody s investors service  standard poor s and fitch ratings are baa  bbb and bbb  respectively 
its current short term debt credit ratings from moody s investors service  standard poor s and fitch ratings are p  a and f  respectively

table of contents outlook in  the company expects to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to contribute to million to its foreign and us pension plans  use million of cash for restructuring activities related to project acceleration  and fund capital expenditures of approximately million  which include expenditures associated with the implementation of sap 
overall  the company believes that available cash and cash equivalents  cash flows generated from future operations  access to capital markets  and availability under the revolver  will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses  assuming the company refinances its maturing short term debt in resolution of income tax contingencies in  and  the company recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net income tax benefits as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the irs  the settlement of certain tax contingency reserves  the reversal of a valuation allowance  the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters and the reorganization of certain legal entities in europe

total does not include contractual obligations reported on the december  balance sheet as current liabilities  except for current portion of long term debt 
the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits 
as a large taxpayer  the company is under continual audit by the irs and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions  and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year 
while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the million in unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  at december  is excluded from the preceding table 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
additionally  the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table 
the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets  among other factors 
as of december   the company had liabilities related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans of million 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   the company had million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company s self insurance programs  including workers compensation  product liability and medical 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   the company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in that footnote  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe the company s critical accounting policies 
sales recognition sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change  which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms 
sales are net of provisions for cash discounts  returns  customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts  cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts 
recovery of accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
accounts are reviewed for potential write off on a case by case basis 
accounts deemed uncollectible are written off  net of expected recoveries 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 

table of contents inventory reserves the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in the third quarter of  the company conducted its annual test of impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets primarily trademarks and trade names 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is one level below the operating segment level herein referred to as the reporting unit 
the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process 
the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived intangible asset is below its carrying amount 
the impact of the macroeconomic environment on the company during the fourth quarter of combined with the updated outlook for certain business units during the period led the company to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of december  as a result  during  the company completed its annual impairment test during the third quarter of and completed an impairment test as of december  based on events and circumstances that arose during the fourth quarter of in its goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than the fair value  impairment may be present 
the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units generally based on discounted cash flow models  market multiples of earnings  or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer  if available 
the company assesses the fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trademark or trade name 
the company s use of a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets involves several assumptions  and changes in assumptions could materially impact fair value estimates 
assumptions critical to the company s fair value estimates under the discounted cash flow models include discount rates  royalty rates  and cash flow projections  and inherent in cash flow projections are estimates regarding projected revenue growth rates  projected cost reductions and efficiencies  and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values 
the company measures the amount of any goodwill impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company identifies unrecognized intangible assets  such as trade name and customer relationships  and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting unit s recognized and unrecognized intangible assets 
the estimated values of the reporting unit s intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting unit s total value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is also recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 
for the annual impairment testing in the third quarter of  the company determined that the fair values of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair values of the company s reporting units  which were not deemed to be impaired based on the annual impairment testing in the third quarter  would not cause the carrying value of each respective reporting unit to exceed its fair value 
for the impairment testing as of december   the economic events and circumstances that arose during the fourth quarter of  and the associated impact on the outlooks for certain of the company s reporting units  led the company to record a non cash impairment charge of million principally related to goodwill of certain business units in the tools hardware and office products segments 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the company s customer base and net sales  a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers  or sustained declines in the company s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity 
the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
subsequent to december   the company s total market capitalization periodically 
table of contents declined below the company s december  consolidated stockholders equity balance 
if the company s total market capitalization is below consolidated stockholders equity balance at a future reporting date or for a sustained period  the company considers this an indicator of potential impairment of goodwill 
the company utilizes market capitalization in corroborating its assessment of the fair value of its reporting units 
as a result  the company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors which could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
capitalized software costs the company capitalizes costs associated with internal use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development 
capitalized internal use software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software  ii payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project  and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software 
capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose 
the company expenses as incurred research and development  general and administrative and indirect costs associated with internal use software 
in addition  the company expenses as incurred training  maintenance and other internal use software costs incurred during the post implementation stage 
costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal use software are only capitalized if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software 
capitalized software costs were million at december  capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december  the company amortizes internal use software costs using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software 
capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used 
impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 
other long lived assets the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present 
these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
if impairment indicators are present  the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets 
the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount 
the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses  working capital  and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company s strategic plan 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
generally  the company performs its testing of the asset group at the product line level  as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 
product liability reserves the company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance 
the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods  review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves 
the company s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company s product liability reserve 
the company has product liability reserves of million as of december  while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims  the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company  and such additional losses may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
legal and environmental reserves the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations  as well as contract and other disputes 
the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters 
the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
no insurance recovery is taken into 
table of contents account in determining the company s cost estimates or reserve  nor do the company s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes  except with respect to long term operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability cercla matters which are estimated at present value 
the company s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december  ranged between million and million 
as of december   the company had a reserve of million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate  which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 
the company s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities 
although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken  which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
for uncertain tax positions  the company applies the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
the company s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
pensions and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and rate of compensation increases  discussed below discount rates the company generally estimates the discount rate for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the company believes this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities 
health care cost trend rate the company s health care cost trend rate is based on historical retiree cost data  near term health care outlook  and industry benchmarks and surveys 
expected return on plan assets the company s expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes 
the company s analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  however  the assumptions are primarily based on long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality rates mortality rates are based on actual and projected plan experience 
rate of compensation increase the rate of compensation increases reflects the company s long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated 
table of contents financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used 
the following tables summarize the company s pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in millions us international pension plan assets and obligations  net prepaid benefit cost accrued current benefit cost accrued noncurrent benefit cost net liability recognized in the consolidated balance sheet us other postretirement benefit obligations accrued current benefit cost accrued noncurrent benefit cost liability recognized in the consolidated balance sheet the following table summarizes the net pre tax cost associated with pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in millions net pension cost net postretirement benefit costs total the company used weighted average discount rates of and to determine the expenses for for the pension and post retirement plans  respectively

the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is amortized to expense over the average life of each plan 
the net amount amortized to expense totaled million pre tax in  and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future 
changes in actuarial assumptions  actual returns on plan assets  and changes in the actuarially determined average life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain loss recognized as expense annually

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company prospectively adopted the effective provisions of sfas on january   as required for financial assets and liabilities 
the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued staff position effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  which deferred the effective date of sfas as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis until january  the adoption of sfas for the company s nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas discusses valuation techniques  such as the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flow  and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect the company s market assumptions 
sfas utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the following is a brief description of those three levels level observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions

table of contents forward looking statements forward looking statements in this report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements may relate to  but are not limited to  information or assumptions about the effects of sales including pricing  income loss  earnings per share  operating income or gross margin improvements or declines  project acceleration  capital and other expenditures  working capital  cash flow  dividends  capital structure  debt to capitalization ratios  availability of financing  interest rates  restructuring  impairment and other charges  potential losses on divestitures  impact of changes in accounting standards  pending legal proceedings and claims including environmental matters  future economic performance  costs and cost savings including raw material and sourced product inflation  productivity and streamlining  synergies  management s plans  goals and objectives for future operations  performance and growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forward looking statements 
these statements generally are accompanied by words such as intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  project  target  plan  expect  will  should  would or similar statements 
the company cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the company s dependence on the strength of retail economies in light of the global economic slowdown  currency fluctuations  competition with other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products  major retailers strong bargaining power  changes in the prices of raw materials and sourced products and the company s ability to obtain raw materials and sourced products in a timely manner from suppliers  the company s ability to develop innovative new products and to develop  maintain and strengthen its end user brands  the company s ability to expeditiously close facilities and move operations while managing foreign regulations and other impediments  the company s ability to manage successfully risks associated with divesting or discontinuing businesses and product lines  the company s ability to implement successfully information technology solutions throughout its organization  the company s ability to improve productivity and streamline operations  the company s ability to refinance short term debt on terms acceptable to it particularly given the recent turmoil and uncertainty in the global credit markets  changes to the company s credit ratings  increases in the funding obligations related to the company s pension plans due to declining asset values or otherwise  the imposition of tax liabilities greater than the company s provisions for such matters  the risks inherent in the company s foreign operations and those matters set forth in this report generally and item a to this report 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company has correctly identified and assessed all of the factors affecting the company or that the publicly available and other information the company receives with respect to these factors is complete or correct 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices 
pursuant to the company s policies  natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floating rate debt 
the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and its conservative debt ratio target 
interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates 
accordingly  benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements 
interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions  and for qualifying hedges  the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 
excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate  fixed rate debt represented approximately of the company s billion of total debt as of december  foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company s sales  expenses  and operating transactions are conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in us dollars  the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less 
the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts and purchased options as economic hedges for 
table of contents commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transactions 
gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 
the company also incurs gains and losses recorded within shareholders equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its entities to us dollars 
the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk 
the company hedges portions of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries  including intercompany loans  with forward contracts and cross currency hedges 
gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and cross currency hedges  which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries  are recognized in other comprehensive income 
commodity prices the company purchases certain raw materials  including resin  corrugate  steel  stainless steel  aluminum and other metals  which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors 
while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain  a variety of programs  including periodic raw material purchases  purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk 
where practical  the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 
financial instruments in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses interest rate swaps  foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps 
derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  as follows in millions prepaid expenses and other other assets other accrued liabilities see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 
value at risk the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model 
the value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equity method investments 
the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day 
the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table sets forth the one day value at risk as of and for the year ended december  in millions  except percentages market risk average december  average december  confidence level interest rates foreign exchange the company generally does not enter into material derivative contracts for commodities  therefore  commodity price risk is not shown because the amounts are not material 
the year over year increase in value at risk in foreign exchange is primarily due to a significant increase in the volatility of foreign exchange rates in the confidence interval signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company s favor 
the value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the 
table of contents company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
additionally  since the company operates globally  and therefore  among a broad basket of currencies  its foreign currency exposure is diversified 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets
