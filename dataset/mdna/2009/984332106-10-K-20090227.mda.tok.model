table of contents marketing services revenues from owned and operated sites 
marketing services revenues from owned and operated sites for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or percent  as compared to factors leading to growth in overall marketing services revenues included an increase in user activity levels on yahoo properties  which contributed to a higher volume of search queries  page views  and ad impression displays 
the transition of and changes in certain of our broadband access partnerships from being fee paying user based to an advertising revenue sharing model have also contributed to the increase in marketing services revenues from owned and operated sites 
marketing services revenues from owned and operated sites for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or percent  as compared to the year over year growth in marketing services revenues in can be attributed to a combination of factors that have driven increased marketing services revenues across yahoo properties both domestically and internationally 
these included an increase in our user base and activity levels on yahoo properties  which resulted in a higher volume of search queries  ad impression displays  and click throughs 
the primary components of growth in our marketing services revenues from owned and operated sites are search and display advertising 
for the year ended december   revenues from search advertising on owned and operated sites grew percent  compared to for the year ended december   revenues from display advertising on owned and operated sites grew percent  compared to we periodically review and refine our methodology for monitoring  gathering  and counting page views to more accurately reflect the total number of web pages viewed by users on yahoo properties 
based on this process  from time to time we update our methodology to exclude from the count of page views interactions with our servers that we determine or believe are not the result of user visits to our owned and operated sites 
using our updated methodology  for the year ended december  as compared to  page views increased percent and revenue per page view decreased percent  and for the year ended december  as compared to  page views increased percent and revenue per page view increased percent 
the decrease in revenue per page view in compared to is due to a shift to lower yielding display advertising 
the increase in revenue per page view in compared to was due to the introduction of new inventory with higher yields 
in the table below  we set forth the quarterly and year over year growth in page views and revenue per page view for the year ended december  and the year over year growth in page views and revenue per page view for the year ended december   both as previously reported and as revised to reflect our updated methodology

table of contents previously disclosed in the annual report on form k 
for the three month period ended march   the reported page view growth and revenue per page view growth were based on page views on our owned and operated sites  searches on affiliate sites and associated revenues on both owned and operated and affiliate sites 
beginning in the second quarter of  we revised our presentation of page views and revenue per page view to include only page views on owned and operated sites and revenues from such page views  and to exclude searches on affiliate sites and revenues from such searches 
if the previously reported page view growth and revenue per page view growth for the three month period ended march  were adjusted to reflect the presentation adopted in the second quarter of but not our updated methodology for counting page views  the reported percentages would have been percent and negative percent  respectively  for the three month period ended march  we currently expect marketing services revenues on our owned and operated sites to decrease for the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of due primarily to global economic conditions 
general economic conditions have caused some advertisers to spend less on online advertising which could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues  particularly our display revenues as advertisers spend less on brand advertising 
in addition  strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies could have a further negative impact on our international revenues 
marketing services revenues from affiliate sites 
marketing services revenues from affiliate sites for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  as compared to marketing services revenues from affiliate sites for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  as compared to during the third quarter of  we sold overture japan to yahoo japan 
as part of this transaction  we also entered into a commercial arrangement with yahoo japan in which we provide search marketing services to yahoo japan for a service fee 
this arrangement began on september  and  beginning on that date  we commenced recording marketing services revenues from yahoo japan for the provision of search marketing services based on a percentage of advertising revenues earned by yahoo japan for the delivery of sponsored search results 
the sale of overture japan to yahoo japan negatively impacted affiliate revenues during the year ended december  by approximately million  year over year 
we continue to employ network quality initiatives to improve return on investment for our advertisers 
we expect a continuing decline in marketing services revenues from affiliate sites for the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of due primarily to these network quality initiatives and global economic conditions 
the current general economic conditions have caused some advertisers to spend less on online advertising  which could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues  particularly our display revenues as advertisers spend less on brand advertising 
in addition  strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies could have a further negative impact on our international revenues 
the number of searches on affiliate sites increased by approximately percent for the year ended december   as compared to the increase in the volume of searches is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of searches per affiliate 
the number of searches on affiliate sites increased by approximately percent for the year ended december   as compared to the increase in the volume of searches is primarily attributable to a net increase in the number of affiliates 
the average revenue per search on our affiliate sites decreased by percent for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily as a result of a change in traffic mix and the impact of the sale of overture japan to yahoo japan 
the average revenue per search on our affiliate sites decreased by percent for the year ended december   as compared to primarily as a result of a decline in revenues from certain affiliate sites 

table of contents fees revenues 
our fees revenues include premium fee based services such as internet broadband services  sports  music  photos  games  personals  premium e mail offerings  and services for small businesses 
other fee based revenues include royalties  licenses  and mobile services 
for the year ended december   fees revenues increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to this relatively flat year over year trend is due to the ongoing transition of and changes in certain of our broadband access partnerships  from being fee paying user based to an advertising revenue sharing model 
this has resulted in a reduction in fees revenues associated with these partnerships 
the transition of and changes in certain of our broadband access partnerships from being fee paying user based to an advertising revenue sharing model have also contributed to the increase in marketing services revenues from owned and operated sites 
as we have renewed contracts with broadband partners and our relationships have moved from being fee paying user based to an advertising revenue sharing model  our number of fee paying users has decreased 
in addition to the transition of the broadband partnerships  we have transitioned out of the voip and subscription music businesses 
due to these factors and global economic conditions  we expect fees revenues to continue to decline for the first quarter of  as compared to the first quarter of in addition  strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies could have a further negative impact on our international revenues 
as used in this discussion  fee paying users is based on the total number of fee based subscriptions aggregated from each yahoo property 
to calculate the average revenue per fee paying user  we divide the revenue generated from the subscriptions by the average fee paying users during the year 
the number of paying users for our fee based services decreased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  this decrease of percent was a result of the business model changes described above 
adjusting the number of fee paying users as of december  to remove fee paying users related to our renewed broadband relationships  our fee paying users would have been million as of december   compared to million as of december   a decrease of percent 
for the year ended december   fees revenues increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to the year over year growth in  as compared to  is associated with an increase in the number of paying users for our fee based services across most of our offerings 
the number of paying users was million as of december   compared to million as of december   an increase of percent 
the impact of this increase in our number of paying users was offset by a reduction in the average monthly revenues per paying user discussed below 
average monthly revenues per paying user was approximately for the year ended december   compared to approximately and for the same periods in and  respectively 
the increase in average monthly revenues per paying user for the year ended december  is due to the change in mix of fee based subscribers  primarily the reduction in broadband subscribers due to the renegotiation of broadband partnerships from fee paying user based to an advertising revenue sharing model

international operating income before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  as compared to the decrease in international operating income before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation year over year is primarily due to the million goodwill impairment charge related to our european reporting unit which is part of our international segment 
see note goodwill in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in addition  international operating loss before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  includes restructuring charges of million 
international revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or percent  as compared to more than percent of the international revenues increase in came from marketing 
table of contents services revenues 
the year over year growth in international marketing services revenues can be attributed to our increased penetration into existing markets  coupled with growth of the global online advertising marketplace 
international operating income before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  as compared to international revenues accounted for approximately percent of total revenues during and percent of total revenues during both and  respectively 
international revenues in decreased million  or percent  as compared to our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include australian dollars  british pounds  euros  korean won  and taiwan dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses  and net income for our international segment 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses  and net income will increase for our international segment if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been higher than we reported by approximately million and our international segment operating loss before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense would have been higher than we reported by million which includes million related to the goodwill impairment

currently  we do not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to our us operations 
we invest excess cash predominantly in money market funds and marketable debt securities that are liquid  highly rated  and the majority of which have effective maturities of less than one year 
our marketable debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized gains or losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are reported in other income  net 
the fair value for securities is determined based on quoted market prices of the historical underlying security or from readily available pricing sources for the identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded as of the valuation date 
as of december   certain of our marketable debt securities had a fair value below cost due to the changes in market rates of interest and yields on these securities 
we evaluate these investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment and review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for an anticipated recovery in market value 
we have the intent and ability to hold these securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the initial cost of the investment and expect to realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity or sale 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations for the first quarter of we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity because we believe that internally generated cash 
table of contents flows are sufficient to support our business operations and capital expenditures 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable debt securities  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equity  or debt securities  or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position  and the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
cash flow changes cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income  adjusted for non cash items  and non operating gains and losses from sales of investments 
non cash adjustments include depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense net of stock based restructuring expense reversals  non cash restructuring charges  goodwill impairment  tax benefits from stock based awards  and excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
cash provided by operating activities was greater than net income in mainly due to the net impact of non cash adjustments to income 
in the year ended december   operating cash flows were positively impacted by changes in working capital balances  including a one time payment from at t inc in each of the three years ended december    and  cash flows from operations were reduced by the increase in our accounts receivable balance  mainly reflecting increases in revenues 
additionally  in the years ended december    and  there were significant increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities that positively impacted cash flow from operations 
in  these increases were mainly due to higher accrual balances for restructuring 
in  these increases were mainly due to higher accrual balances for taxes payable 
in  these increases were mainly due to tac payments to affiliates 
cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to capital expenditures  purchases  sales and maturities of marketable debt securities  purchases of intangible assets  as well as acquisitions including our strategic investments 
our capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively

in the ordinary course of business  we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers  vendors  lessors  joint venture and business partners  purchasers of assets or subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us  services to be provided by us  intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties or  with respect to the sale of assets or a subsidiary  matters related to our conduct of the business and tax matters prior to the sale 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
we have also agreed to indemnify certain former officers  directors  and employees of acquired companies in connection with the acquisition of such companies 
we maintain director and officer insurance  which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers and former directors and officers of acquired companies  in certain circumstances 
it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are generated from marketing services and fees 
marketing services revenues are generated from several offerings including the display of textual  graphical advertisements  display of text based links to advertisers websites  listing based services  and commerce based transactions 
fees revenues include revenues from a variety of consumer and business fee based services 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we may enter into certain sales transactions that involve multiple elements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  whether the arrangement should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent  whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the purchase arrangements with our customer for which we can reasonably estimate fair value  and whether the arrangement should be characterized as revenue or a reimbursement of costs incurred 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will 
table of contents be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  new tax legislation  or the change of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
we record a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize these deferred income tax assets in the future  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
we increased our valuation allowance by million during the year ended december  this increase is mainly attributable to international net operating loss carryforwards 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the performance of the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value 
an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value 
our reporting units are based on geography  either at the operating segment level or one level below operating segments 
the fair values of our reporting units are estimated using an average of a market approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants and is consistent with the methodology used for the goodwill impairment test in the prior year 
in addition  we ensure that the fair values estimated under these two approaches are consistent with each other 
under the market approach  we utilize publicly traded comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples that are used to value our reporting units adjusted for an estimated control premium 
under the income approach  we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including selection of market comparables  estimated future cash flows  and discount rates 
these components are discussed below market comparables we select comparable companies in the specific regions in which our reporting units operate based on similarity of type of business  primarily those involved in online advertising  and relative size of those companies compared to our reporting units 
trailing and forward revenue and earnings multiples derived from these comparable companies are applied to financial metrics of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair values 
estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections for each reporting unit using a five year forecast of free cash flows and a terminal value based on the perpetuity growth model 
the five year forecast and related assumptions were derived from the most recent annual financial forecast for which the planning process commenced in our fourth quarter 
key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include  among other items  revenue and operating expense growth rates  terminal value growth rate  and capital expenditure and working capital levels 
significant management judgment is involved in determining these assumptions 

table of contents discount rates we employ a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine the discount rates used in our cash flow projections 
the determination of the discount rates for each reporting unit includes factors such as the risk free rate of return and the return an outside investor would expect to earn based on the overall level of inherent risk 
the determination of expected returns includes consideration of the beta a measure of risk of traded securities of comparable companies 
the discount rates used in this year s goodwill impairment test were higher than the prior year to take into account the increased risk of achieving forecasts given the prevailing macroeconomic and capital market conditions 
a two percent increase or decrease in the discount rates in each of the reporting units would not affect the outcomes of the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the sum of the fair values of our reporting units is reconciled to our market capitalization adjusted for an estimated control premium 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test as of october  and determined that the fair values of our reporting units  with the exception of our european reporting unit  exceeded their carrying values by a significant margin and therefore goodwill in those reporting units was not impaired 
we concluded that the carrying value of our european reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
see note goodwill in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could trigger future impairment 
intangible assets 
we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
identifiable amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value is determined based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future cash flows using discount rates determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect estimated future cash flows relating to our intangible assets which could trigger impairment 
no impairments of intangible assets were identified during any of the periods presented 
investments in equity interests 
we account for investments in the common stock of entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method 
in accounting for these investments we record our proportionate share of the entities net income or loss  one quarter in arrears 
we review our investments in equity interests for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the investment 
the determination of fair value of the investment involves considering factors such as the stock prices of public companies in which we have an equity investment  current economic and market conditions  the operating performance of the companies  including current earnings trends and forecasted cash flows  and other company and industry specific information 
the fair value determination  particularly for investments in privately held companies  requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other than temporary 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under the fair value recognition provisions of 
table of contents sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock based options  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting award forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  with a term of one year or greater 
we believe that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on our common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility 
therefore  expected volatility for the year ended december  was based on a market based implied volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting award forfeiture rate  as well as the probability that performance conditions that affect the vesting of certain awards will be achieved  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate this forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted and cancelled 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our original estimates  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all current and previously recognized expense for unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
in addition  because many of our stock based awards have vesting schedules of two or three years cliff vests  a significant change in our actual or expected forfeiture experience will result in the reversal of stock based compensation which was recorded in prior years for all unvested awards 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in money market funds and liquid marketable debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  state municipalities  and in high quality corporate issuers 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had investments in short term marketable debt securities of approximately billion and million  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
as of december  and  we had investments in long term marketable debt securities of approximately million and million  respectively 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately percent and percent  respectively 

table of contents a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million and million decrease approximately percent  respectively  in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities as of december  and foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for approximately percent of total revenues during and percent of total revenues during both and  respectively 
international revenues in decreased million  or percent  as compared to revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include australian dollars  british pounds  euros  korean won  and taiwan dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses  and net income for our international segment 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses  and net income will increase for our international segment if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been higher than we reported by approximately million and our international segment operating loss before depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense would have been higher than we reported by million which includes million related to the goodwill impairment 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and our investments in equity interests into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars results in a gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is part of stockholders equity 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the respective entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a gain or loss 
we recorded foreign currency transaction gains and losses  realized and unrealized  in other income  net on the consolidated statements of income  of approximately million of net losses in and net gains of million and million in and  respectively 
investment risk 
we are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest excess cash in marketable debt securities and strategic public equity investments 
our cash and debt investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements 
a portion of our cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of our investment policy 
our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one corporate issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of liquid fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december  and  net unrealized gains and losses on these investments were not material 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for business and strategic purposes and have classified these securities as available for sale or investment in equity interests 
these investments may be subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
we have realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale investments  which were not material as of december  and our investments in available for sale equity securities amounted to million and million  respectively  as of december  and our objective in managing exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to earnings and cash flows 
using a hypothetical reduction of percent in the stock price of these available for sale investments  the fair value of our equity investments would decrease by approximately million as of december  and million as of december  during the year ended december   we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million  net of tax  within earnings in equity interests to reduce the carrying value of our direct investment in alibaba
