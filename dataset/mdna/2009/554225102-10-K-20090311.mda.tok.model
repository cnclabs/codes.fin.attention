macatawa bank mortgage company  a subsidiary of macatawa bank  originates and sells residential mortgage loans into the secondary market on a servicing released basis 
we have generally experienced rapid growth since opening macatawa bank in november of with assets reaching billion as of december  at the end of and into  the company has managed its growth at a slower rate to focus on maintaining asset quality within the generally weak economic conditions in west michigan 
since our inception in  we have raised approximately million in capital through private and public common and preferred stock offerings and trust preferred offerings to ensure the company s safety and soundness and to facilitate our growth and progress over these years 
we believe that growth in core deposits is key to our long term success and is our primary funding source for asset growth 
establishing a branching network in our markets has been of high importance in order to facilitate this core deposit growth 
we have gained community awareness and acceptance in our markets through this expanding branch network and our high quality service standards 
the west michigan markets within which we operate continue to provide significant expansion opportunities for us 
we opened our twenty sixth branch during the second quarter of on the southeast side of the greater grand rapids area 
because of the significance of the greater grand rapids market and as it represents the greatest opportunity for market share growth  we anticipate additional branch openings in this market within the next few years 
we also continue to enjoy success in building new and existing relationships in the holland zeeland and grand haven markets 
we anticipate that when economic conditions strengthen again we will continue to experience growth in our balance sheet and in our earnings due to these expansion opportunities 
results of operations summary net loss available to common shares was million or loss per common share for compared to net income of million or per common diluted share for  and net income of million or per common diluted share for the results for include a non cash  after tax impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets of million  discussed more fully below 
the primary reason for the remaining decline in earnings for and compared to was an increase in the provision for loan losses to address continued deterioration in the loan portfolio  primarily commercial real estate loans to residential land developers 
the provision for loan losses was million in  million in and million in circumstances associated with these losses are described under loan portfolio and asset quality and allowance for loan losses 
net interest income net interest income totaled million during compared to million during and million during the decrease in net interest income during compared to was primarily due to a decline in the net interest margin partially offset by an increase in average earning assets 
average interest earning assets increased by million  to billion for the net interest margin decreased basis points to for from for approximately half of the decline in net interest margin was from rising balances of non performing assets throughout the remaining decline was largely driven by the federal funds and prime rate cuts that began in late  resulting in a more rapid decline in the yield on assets compared to the cost of funds 
the yield on earning assets decreased basis points to for from for the basis point decline in the prime rate that began in the third quarter of caused a decrease in the yield on our variable rate loan portfolio and was the primary reason for the decrease in yield on earning assets 
also contributing to the decrease was the impact of rising balances of nonperforming loans throughout and into which resulted in a decline of approximately basis points in the yield on assets 
the cost of funds decreased basis points to in from in a decrease in the rates paid on our deposit accounts in response to declining market rates  the rollover of time deposits at lower rates  and the repositioning of other borrowings within the lower rate environment  were the primary reasons for the decrease in the cost of funds 
the decrease in net interest income during compared to was primarily due to a decline in the net interest margin partially offset by an increase in average earning assets 
average interest earning assets increased by million  or  to billion for the net interest margin decreased basis points to for from for from both a decrease in the yield on earning assets and an increase in the cost of funds 
the impact of rising balances of nonperforming loans during was the primary reason for the basis point decline in the yield on assets during the period 
the general increase in rates paid on deposit accounts  the rollover of time deposits at higher rates and a shift to higher costing funds within the generally high interest rate environment that occurred throughout and through the third quarter of are the primary reasons for the basis point increase in cost of funds during the period 
the decrease in market rates that began in late september of  however  led to a decline in the cost of funds during the fourth quarter of  partially offsetting the increase in cost of funds for the year 
anticipated growth in earning assets is expected to continue at lower levels than we have experienced in the past due to the generally weak economic conditions in michigan that remain and are expected to continue into the declines in the federal funds and prime rates that occurred into late may have a negative impact on net interest income in early  although the impact is expected to be more than offset by a continued decline in the cost of funds  as term funding is expected to rollover at lower costs throughout the following table shows an analysis of net interest margin for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  dollars in thousands average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost assets taxable securities    tax exempt securities    loans    federal home loan bank stock   federal funds sold and other short term investments   total interest earning assets   noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks   other    total assets   liabilities and shareholders equity deposits interest bearing demand   savings and money market accounts   time deposits    borrowings other borrowed funds    long term debt    federal funds purchased   total interest bearing liabilities   noninterest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing demand accounts  other noninterest bearing liabilities  shareholders equity   total liabilities and shareholders equity   net interest income   net interest spread net interest margin ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities yields are adjusted for tax exempt interest

the ultimate amount of the loan loss provision in all periods is a byproduct of establishing our allowance for loan losses at levels deemed necessary in our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance 
for more information about our allowance for loan losses and our methodology for establishing its level  see the discussion under the section allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income totaled million during compared to million during and million in the million overall increase in included approximately  and  of gains on the sale of securities and gains realized on the settlement of interest rate swaps which were free standing derivatives carried at fair value 
the company chose to execute these transactions to support its shift to a more balanced sensitivity to future interest rate changes 
for more information about the interest rate swaps  refer to the notes of the financial statements 
deposit service charge income increased  or to million for compared to million for and million for the increase in each period primarily reflects the continued expansion of our deposit customer account base 
gain on sales of loans primarily includes gains on the sale of real estate mortgage loans  and to a lesser extent  gains on the sale of the sba guaranteed portion of certain commercial loans 
we sell the majority of the fixed rate mortgage loans we originate 
we do not retain the servicing rights for the loans we sell 
a summary of gain on sales of loans and related volume was as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december gain on the sale of sba guaranteed loans net gain on the sale of real estate mortgage loans  gain on sales of loans    real estate mortgage loans originated for sale   real estate mortgage loans sold    net gain on the sale of real estate mortgage loans as a percent of real estate mortgage loans sold loan sales margin gain on sales of loans decreased  and  respectively  in and the decline in was the result of a slight decline in sales volumes 
the decline in was impacted by lower sales volumes and a declining sales margin 
as sales volumes have declined since  competition has generally increased and resulted in the slight decline in loan sales margin since mortgage interest rate levels generally increased from into from corrections in the housing market  which contributed to the decline in residential refinancing and new loan originations since the declines in and also reflect the company s interest in holding more of its mortgage loan volume in its portfolio as discussed more fully below under loan portfolio and asset quality 
mortgage interest rate levels have most recently declined in response to weakening economic conditions and resulting government action intended to encourage bank lending 
we expect increased refinancing activity from these lower rates to positively impact gains on sales of loans as we enter revenues from trust services decreased  or to million for and increased million or to million for general declines in customer stock portfolio values associated with the significant decline in the stock market during were the primary reason for the decrease in trust income in the majority of the increase in trust fees in was related to the impact of customer relationships added from the smith associates acquisition on january  and from the addition of new trust customers throughout other income increased million in and  in the increase for includes a  gain on the termination of certain borrowings and the increase for includes a  unrealized gain on the company s interest rate swaps  both associated with the company s overall management of interest rate risk 
for more information about the company s other borrowing activities and interest rate swaps  refer to the notes to the financial statements 
the remaining increases in each period are primarily a result of growth in customers and customer activity related to various banking services 
debit and atm card processing income increased  in and  in  representing the majority of the increase in other income 
the increase in debit and atm card processing income reflects a continued increase in usage from current customers and overall growth in the number of debit and atm card customers 
promotional efforts to increase volume in these low cost transaction alternatives continue to be met with success 
also contributing to the increase in other income was increased revenues from investment services which grew  or to  for and  or to  for noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million for as compared to million for and million for the increase of million in is primarily due to a non recurring impairment charge for goodwill of million and an impairment charge for intangible assets of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets 
the company s common stock price dropped during the fourth quarter resulting in a decline in its market capitalization below its book value 
accordingly  the results of its impairment testing showed that the estimated fair value of the company was less than its carrying value of equity and the value of certain intangible assets were less than their carrying value 
these impairment charges do not impact the company s tangible equity or regulatory capital ratios  and do not affect the company s liquidity position 
the remaining million increase in and the million increase in is discussed more fully below 
the primary reason for the remaining increase in total noninterest expense for related to the cost of higher levels of nonperforming assets 
costs associated with nonperforming assets include legal costs  repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense and losses on foreclosed properties 
repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense includes survey and appraisal  property maintenance and management and other disposition and carrying costs 
losses on foreclosed properties include both net losses on the sale of foreclosed properties and subsequent reductions from value declines for outstanding foreclosed properties 
these costs amounted to approximately million for  million for and  for as itemized in the following table in thousands legal and professional repossessed and foreclosed property administration  losses on foreclosed properties  total   salaries increased million in primarily due to staff additions and merit increases 
staff additions occurred primarily in the first half of the year in varied positions throughout the company  including risk management  credit administration and problem asset departments  and selective sales personnel to support growth in deposits and commercial and industrial lending 
during the second half of  salary and benefit levels began to experience a decline primarily from staff reduction initiatives in certain operational and sales functions and the elimination or outsourcing of certain backroom functions associated with expense reduction initiatives 
salaries and benefits increased  in largely from an increase in staff associated with the opening of two new branch locations and the addition of the new asset management group from the acquisition of smith associates on january the costs associated with these staffing increases were partially offset by a reduction in performance incentives associated with the decline in earnings levels 
occupancy expense increased  in and  in and furniture and equipment expense increased  in and  in the increase in occupancy expense is consistent with our branch and facility expansion 
the company opened four new facilities in  including two new branches and two branch relocations 
the increase in furniture and equipment expense relates to costs associated with improving our internal and customer technologies  as well as costs associated with our facility expansion 
the million increase in legal and professional fees in relates to invoices received over time in connection with the trade partners litigation which were expected to be paid by the company s insurance carrier  but have since been deemed non reimbursable 
the trade partners litigation is further discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
when excluding the impact of these legal costs  legal and professional fees have remained relatively flat since fdic assessments increased by  and  in and the increase in was primarily due to an increase in insurance rates related to higher nonperforming asset levels 
the increase in was primarily related to a change by the fdic in their charges for all banks effective january  remaining expense categories  including marketing  data processing and other expense  declined in as a result of expense reduction initiatives 
in addition to eliminating or outsourcing certain backroom functions discussed above  these initiatives further included restructuring third party contracts  acceleration of electronic delivery for certain customers and significantly trimming controllable costs 
the increase in other expense of million in was primarily due to increases in various categories consistent with our customer account growth 
these costs included debit card and atm processing  customer and internal courier  brokerage account processing and outside service support 
expense reduction initiatives that began in early have allowed the company to manage costs in other areas to offset the increases driven by higher nonperforming asset levels 
we expect efficiency  excluding the additional costs necessary to manage non performing assets  to continue to improve in response to these initiatives and by better utilizing our capacity as we grow 
federal income tax expense benefit our federal income tax expense has fluctuated generally commensurate with changes in pre tax earnings 
in  the company recorded a tax benefit of million as a result of the net loss during the year 
in and  our federal income tax expense was lower than the amount computed by applying our statutory federal income tax rate of to our pre tax earnings primarily due to tax exempt interest income and income from bank owned life insurance 
our effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
financial condition summary total assets were billion at december   an increase of million from billion at december  an increase in federal funds and short term investments and portfolio loans were largely offset by declines in securities available for sale and goodwill and other intangible assets 
the growth in assets during was lower than historical levels primarily because of the weak economic conditions in west michigan that began in and has continued throughout because of these declining conditions  management focused much of its efforts in on improving its financial condition  including diversifying its asset base and improving its capital position  liquidity and asset quality 
the slight growth in assets during was funded by growth in deposits 
the growth in deposits in excess of assets allowed the company to reduce its other borrowing levels 
cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents  which include federal funds sold and short term investments  were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in included an increase in seasonal balances associated with institutional depositors  including municipalities and public fund authorities 
in addition  the company increased its short term investments to improve its liquidity position during these turbulent times 
securities securities decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to calls and maturities and the sale of approximately million of us government agency bonds  partially offset by purchases of us government agency bonds 
the sales of securities resulted in gross gains of  and helped position its assets and liabilities to a more balanced sensitivity to interest rates 
we maintain our security portfolio at a level to provide diversity in the level of credit risk within our asset base  to support our liquidity needs and to balance our interest rate risk 
our portfolio consists primarily of high quality u 
s government agency and state and local municipal bonds classified as available for sale 
these securities are generally purchased at fixed rates to help offset the interest sensitivity of our variable rate loan portfolio 
we expect growth of our securities portfolio to be consistent with the growth of our company to maintain the diversity of our assets and support our liquidity and interest rate risk management 
loan portfolio and asset quality our total loan portfolio increased million to billion at december  from billion at december  during  residential mortgage loans increased by million  consumer loans increased  commercial and industrial loans increased million and commercial real estate loans declined million 
our residential real estate loan portfolio  which also includes residential construction loans made to individual homeowners  comprised approximately and of portfolio loans at the end of and  respectively 
our residential real estate portfolio represents only a portion of our residential origination loan volume  as we also sell a large portion of our fixed rate obligations on the secondary market with servicing released 
we originated for sale million in residential mortgages in  million in and million in loans held for sale were million at december  compared to million at december  because of the relatively short duration of our assets  the increase in rates on residential mortgage loans through most of provided us an opportunity to hold more of these higher quality loans in our portfolio 
in response to continued corrections in the housing market and deterioration in the economy  mortgage portfolio volume began to decline near the end of as we head into  mortgage interest rate levels have declined in response to the weakening economic conditions and resulting government action intended to encourage bank lending 
this has generated an increase in residential real estate refinancing activity 
as a result  we anticipate a higher volume of residential mortgage loan sales into the secondary market during the slower loan growth in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios during was a reflection of the weak economic conditions in west michigan 
in particular  deterioration in residential land development has impacted both asset growth and asset quality 
accordingly  the company focused much of its efforts in on reducing its reliance on residential land development  diversifying its commercial loan portfolios and improving asset quality 
total commercial and commercial real estate loans were billion at both december  and this portfolio remains our largest loan segment and accounted for approximately and of the total loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are made up of loans to small and mid sized business 
the commercial loan portfolio we have built reflects the acceptance of our lending approach by our customers and the ability of our lending team to respond to their needs effectively 
our commercial loan department is built around a well seasoned officer team and our lending approach involves an efficient loan approval process 
our commercial and industrial portfolio was million at december  and represented of our commercial portfolio  up from at december  a further breakdown of the composition of the commercial loan portfolio is shown in the table below in thousands december  december  construction land development   farmland and agriculture   nonfarm  nonresidential   multi family   total commercial real estate loans   commercial and industrial   total commercial loans   approximately of the balance of commercial real estate loans at december  was owner occupied while was non owner occupied 
loans for the development or sale of family residential properties were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  representing approximately and of the construction and land development portfolio 
of the balance at december   approximately million was secured by vacant land  million was secured by developed residential land and million was secured by family properties held for speculative purposes 
vacant land is land zoned for residential purposes but with no further development 
developed residential land is land that has been further developed for future residential construction  including but not limited to completed lot surveys  road work  water  sewer and other utility preparation and general land grade 
family properties held for speculative purposes are on developed residential lots and include completed residential homes or residential homes in the process of construction 
our consumer loan portfolio includes loans secured by personal property and home equity fixed term and line of credit loans 
our consumer loan portfolio increased to million at december  from million at december  consumer loans comprised approximately of our portfolio loans at the end of both and our loan portfolio is reviewed regularly by an independent  internal loan review team  our own loan officers  and our senior management 
an administrative loan committee consisting of senior management and seasoned lending and collections personnel meets monthly to manage the company s internal watch list and proactively manage high risk loans 
when reasonable doubt exists concerning collectibility of interest or principal of one of our loans  that loan is placed in non accrual status 
any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current earnings 
nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans  foreclosed assets and repossessed assets 
nonperforming loans include loans on non accrual status  restructured loans and loans delinquent more than days but still accruing 
foreclosed and repossessed assets include assets acquired in settlement of loans 
nonperforming loans as of december  totaled million or of total portfolio loans compared to million or of total portfolio loans at december  nonperforming loans for the development or sale of family residential properties were approximately million or of total non performing loans at december  of this total  approximately million was secured by vacant land  million was secured by developed residential land and million was secured by family properties held for speculative purposes 
the remaining balance of nonperforming loans at the end of consist of a number of commercial loans most of which are on nonaccrual for which we consider to be well collateralized or adequately reserved 
loans for the development or sale of family residential properties were approximately million or of total non performing loans at december  of this total  approximately million was secured by vacant land  million was secured by developed residential land and million was secured by family properties held for speculative purposes 
foreclosed assets totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the increase is the result of the migration of non performing loans secured by real estate into foreclosed assets as the foreclosure process is completed and any redemption period expires 
of the million  there were commercial real estate properties totaling million 
the remaining balance was comprised of residential real estate properties totaling million 
all properties are carried at their fair value less costs to sell 
total nonperforming assets amounted to million or of total assets at december  compared to million or as of december  the following table shows the composition and amount of our nonperforming assets 
dollars in thousands as of december nonaccrual loans    loans days or more delinquent and still accruing  restructured loans total nonperforming loans    foreclosed assets    repossessed assets total nonperforming assets    nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses at december  was million  or of total portfolio loans  compared to million or of total portfolio loans at december  our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate based upon our regular  quarterly assessment of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of allowance relies on several key elements  which include specific allowances for loans considered impaired  formula allowance for graded loans  general allocations based on historical trends for pools of similar loan types and under certain circumstances  reserves related to current market conditions that are pertinent to certain aspects of the loan portfolio 
based upon our internal analysis  in our judgment  we have provided adequate allowances for loan losses  although there can be no assurance that the allowance for losses on loans will be adequate to cover all losses 
the increase in the level of the allowance was primarily related to an increase in impaired loans and a related increase in the level of reserves for these loans 
specific allowances are established in cases where senior credit management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individually impaired credit that we believe indicates the probability that a loss may be incurred 
this amount is determined by methods prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
impaired loans increased million to million at december  the specific allowance for impaired loans was million at december  and at december  approximately million or of impaired loans were for the development or sale of family residential properties 
of this total  approximately million was secured by vacant land  million was secured by developed residential land and million was secured by family properties held for speculative purposes 
in  approximately million or of impaired loans were for the development or sale of family residential properties 
of this total  approximately million was secured by vacant land  million was secured by developed residential land and million was secured by family properties held for speculative purposes 
the allowance allocated to commercial loans that are not considered to be impaired is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk grade of such loans 
we use a loan rating method based upon an eight point system 
loans are assigned a loss allocation factor for each loan classification category 
the lower the grade assigned to a loan category  the greater the allocation percentage that is applied 
changes in risk grade of loans affect the amount of the allowance allocation 
the determination of our loss factors is based upon our actual loss history by loan grade  and adjusted for consideration of significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the analysis date 
the commercial loan allowance was million at december  compared to million at december  groups of homogeneous loans  such as residential real estate  open and closed end consumer loans  etc  receive general allowance allocations based on a review of loss trends by specific loan segments 
these loss allocations are then adjusted based upon past due status  and consideration for general economic and business conditions  collateral values  seasoning of the portfolios and most recent loss experience for similar pools of loans 
the general allowance was million at december  and million at december  the increase was largely related to an increase in the balance of residential real estate loans and a slight increase in the past due status of these loans 
the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan loss at the dates indicated to the extent specific allocations have been determined relative to particular loans 
as of december as of december allowance amount of each category to total loans allowance amount of each category to total loans allowance amount of each category to total loans commercial and commercial real estate    residential real estate consumer    unallocated total    the above allocations are not intended to imply limitations on usage of the allowance 
the entire allowance is available for any loan losses without regard to loan type 
of the million allowance at december   related to specific allocations on impaired loans  related to commercial loan portfolio allocations and related to general allocations for homogeneous loans 
net charge offs totaled million or of average loans for compared to million  or of average loans for and million or of average loans for the majority of the net charge offs in and were largely associated with an increase in the level of impaired loans from continued deterioration in the economy and significant declines in the value of collateral securing impaired real estate loans  primarily residential land development loans 
for residential land development loans  cash flow to service the debt is primarily expected from sales of lots and properties securing these loans  which has declined markedly throughout and this significant deterioration in cash flows and resulting expected future cash flows is the primary reason for the declines in the value of the real estate securing these loans 
net charge offs in include a million charge off related to one commercial borrower whose loans were allegedly falsely secured by nonexistent collateral 
the company filed a lawsuit against this borrower in that is still pending 
these charge offs were considered necessary to bring loan balances to levels considered collectible based upon current information 
the following is a summary of our portfolio loan balances and changes in the allowance for loan losses and related ratios 
dollars in thousands december portfolio loans average daily balance of loans for the year  amount of loans outstanding at end of period  allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of year    addition to allowance charged to operations   loans charged off commercial    residential real estate consumer recoveries commercial residential real estate consumer balance at end of year    ratios net charge offs to average loans outstanding 
allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at year end premises and equipment premises and equipment totaled million at december   representing a decrease of million from december  the decline was largely from deprecation of current facilities in excess of capital additions during there were no new facilities constructed during deposits total deposits increased million to billion at december   as compared to billion at december  of the million in deposit growth  approximately million was from deposits generated through brokers 
the company chose to utilize brokered deposits in to replace borrowed funds and support asset growth because of their generally low cost compared to other alternatives and to support improved liquidity 
the utilization of brokered deposits allowed the company to reduce its reliance on borrowed funds  increase its borrowing capacity and grow federal funds and short term investments for future liquidity needs 
the growth in deposits within the company s markets was slower than historical levels 
because of the weakening economic conditions that occurred in west michigan and nationally throughout  the deposit base slowed or contracted in many of the company s markets and access to liquidity from the national sources impacted many financial institutions 
accordingly  competition within the company s markets continued to intensify for fewer deposit dollars 
despite these market dynamics  the company continued to experience overall new account growth 
noninterest bearing demand accounts comprised approximately of total deposits at both december  and december  interest bearing demand  including money market and savings accounts  comprised approximately of total deposits at december   as compared to at the end of time accounts as a percentage of total deposits were approximately at december   as compared to at the end of although the current environment presents challenges for core deposit growth in the near term  we believe that our continued focus on quality customer service  the desire of customers to deal with a local bank  and the convenience of our expanding and maturing branch network  will provide growth in our core deposits over time 
borrowed funds borrowed funds consist of advances from the federal home loan bank  securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo borrowings  long term debt associated with the issuance of trust preferred securities and federal funds purchased provided by our correspondent banks 
borrowed funds totaled million at december   including million of federal home loan bank advances  million in repo borrowings and million in long term debt associated with trust preferred securities 
borrowed funds totaled million at december  including million of federal home loan bank advances  million in repo borrowings  million in long term debt associated with trust preferred securities and million in federal funds purchased 
the decrease in borrowed funds in was primarily due to the increase in deposits discussed above 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources total shareholders equity was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease of million was primarily from the million net loss the company incurred in  offset by an increase of million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock 
cash dividends of million  or 
per share  were declared and paid on common shares and  or per share  were declared on preferred shares during in order to augment its capital position  the company temporarily suspended its cash dividend to common shareholders during in addition  the company completed a private offering of  shares of series a non cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock series a preferred stock with a liquidation preference of  per share  resulting in capital proceeds of million 
the shares are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at a price per share of 
on or after october   the preferred stock will be subject to mandatory conversion into common stock under certain circumstances 
for more information regarding the private offering  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income was due to an increase in the market value of securities available for sale  as market interest rates for similar securities declined markedly during capital levels for the company continue to be maintained at levels well in excess of regulatory minimums for bank holding companies 
the following table shows the company s various capital ratios for and as of and for the year ended december  average equity to average assets total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier capital to average assets the regulatory ratios increased in primarily due to the issuance of the convertible preferred stock 
the after tax impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets did not impact the company s regulatory capital ratios 
the entire million of trust preferred securities outstanding at december  qualified as tier capital 
for more information regarding the trust preferred securities  please refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
capital sources include  but are not limited to  additional common stock offerings  preferred stock and trust preferred securities offerings and subordinated debt 
the company is also carefully evaluating the us treasury department s capital purchase program for making equity investments in banks  and has applied to participate in that program 
liquidity the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to manage a variety of sources and uses of funds 
our consolidated statements of cash flows categorize these sources and uses into operating  investing and financing activities 
we primarily focus on developing access to a variety of borrowing sources to supplement our deposit gathering activities and provide funds for growing our investment and loan portfolios 
our sources of liquidity include our borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of chicago s discount window  the federal home loan bank  federal funds purchased lines and other secured borrowing sources with our correspondent banks  loan payments by our borrowers  maturity and sales of our securities available for sale  growth of our deposits and deposit equivalents  federal funds sold  and the various capital resources discussed above 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of our customers 
our customers may be either borrowers with credit needs or depositors wanting to withdraw funds 
our liquidity management involves periodic monitoring of our assets considered to be liquid and illiquid  and our funding sources considered to be core and non core and short term less than months and long term 
we have established parameters that monitor  among other items  our level of liquid assets to short term liabilities  our level of non core funding reliance and our level of available borrowing capacity 
we have also developed a contingency funding plan to stress test our liquidity requirements arising from certain events that may trigger liquidity shortages  such as rapid loan growth in excess of normal growth levels or the loss of deposits and other funding sources under extreme circumstances 
we have historically grown our portfolio loans more rapidly than our core deposits 
accordingly  we have relied upon other wholesale funding sources including brokered deposits  borrowings from the federal home loan bank and other borrowing sources 
we maintain a diversified wholesale funding structure and actively manage our maturing wholesale sources to reduce the risk to liquidity shortages 
in response to the volatile conditions in the national markets throughout and  we actively pursued initiatives to further strengthen our liquidity position 
during  we reduced our reliance on other borrowed funds by over million  increased our liquid investments by nearly million and secured a borrowing facility under the federal reserve bank of chicago s discount window 
we feel our liquidity position is sufficient to meet our normal and contingent liquidity needs 
in the normal course of business  we enter into certain contractual obligations including obligations which are considered in our overall liquidity management 
the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  dollars in thousands year or less years years after years time deposit maturities    other borrowed funds    long term debt  total     in addition to normal loan funding  we also maintain liquidity to meet customer financing needs through unused lines of credit  unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
the level and fluctuation of these commitments is also considered in our overall liquidity management 
at december   we had a total of million in unused lines of credit  million in unfunded loan commitments and million in standby letters of credit 
critical accounting and policies estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and future results could differ 
the allowance for loan loss  the status of contingencies  income taxes and goodwill and other intangible assets are deemed critical due to the required level of management judgment and the use of estimates  making them particularly subject to change 
our methodology for determining the allowance for loan loss and the related provision for loan losses is described above in the allowance for loan loss discussion 
this area of accounting requires significant judgment due to the number of factors which can influence the collectibility of a loan 
unanticipated changes in these factors could significantly change the level of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses 
although  based upon our internal analysis  and in our judgment  we have provided an adequate allowance for loan losses  there can be no assurance that our analysis has properly identified all of the probable losses in our loan portfolio 
loss contingencies  including the legal actions involving trade partners as described in the notes to the financial statements  are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
this  too  is an accounting area that involves significant judgment 
although  based upon our judgment and internal analysis we have properly accounted for loss contingencies  future changes in the status of such contingencies could result in a significant change in the level of contingent liabilities and a related impact to operating earnings 
our accounting for income taxes involves the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily associated with differences in the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting and tax purposes 
we have recorded no valuation allowance on the balance of our deferred tax assets because we believe that the tax benefits associated with this asset will more likely than not be realized based upon the levels of taxable income in prior years and the expectation of a return to profitability in future years 
however  changes in tax laws  changes in tax rates and our future level of earnings can adversely impact the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax asset 
our goodwill and intangible assets arose from our past acquisition of a bank and our past acquisition of an investment management firm  as discussed in previous filings 
we test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment utilizing the methodology and guidelines established in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this methodology involves assumptions regarding the valuation of the business entities and intangible assets that contain the acquired entities 
we believe that the assumptions we utilize are reasonable 
based upon our annual impairment analysis in  we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of million as described above under noninterest expense 
there was no remaining goodwill as of december  other intangible assets were  at december forward looking statements this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
we intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities reform act of  and are including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions 
forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans  strategies  and expectations are generally identifiable by use of the words believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  may or similar expressions 
the presentation and discussion of the provision and allowance for loan losses  statements concerning future profitability or future growth or increases  and statements about the adequacy of our capital resources are examples of inherently forward looking statements in that they involve judgments and statements of belief as to the outcome of future events 
our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain 
factors which could have a material adverse affect on our operations and future prospects include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in our market area and accounting principles  policies  and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
further information concerning us and our business  including additional factors that could materially affect our financial results  is included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of our transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
macatawa bank has only limited agricultural related loan assets  and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
our market risk exposure is mainly comprised of our sensitivity to interest rate risk 
our balance sheet has sensitivity  in various categories of assets and liabilities  to changes in prevailing rates in the us  including the federal funds rate  the prime rate  mortgage rates  us treasury rates and various money market indexes 
as part of our asset liability management process  we identify and evaluate opportunities to structure our balance sheet to maximize our earnings while balancing our liquidity and interest rate risk within established parameters 
we utilize a simulation model as our primary measurement technique in our interest rate risk management 
our simulation analyses monitors the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income and the economic value of equity eve resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include the repricing of cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities at current market rates  prepayment speeds on certain assets  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit pricing 
we also assume certain levels of rate sensitivity to changes in market rates of our non maturing transaction deposits based upon our historical sensitivity under previous interest rate cycles  and we include pricing floors on discretionary priced liability products which limit how low various checking and savings products could go under declining interest rates 
these assumptions reflect our pricing philosophy in response to changing interest rates 
we forecast the next twelve months of net interest income under an assumed environment of gradual changes in market interest rates under various scenarios 
the resulting change in net interest income is an indication of the sensitivity of our earnings to directional changes in market interest rates 
the simulation also measures the change in eve  or the net present value of our assets and liabilities  under the same shifts in interest rates  as calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a market based discount rate 
the following table shows the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income over the next twelve months and eve based on our balance sheet as of december  dollars in thousands 
interest rate scenario economic value of equity percent change net interest income percent change change in interest rates basis point rise   basis point rise   base rate scenario   basis point decline   basis point decline   this analysis suggests that we are well balanced  with limited fluctuations in net interest income under each scenario over the next twelve months 
further  our balanced sensitivity in time horizons beyond one year results in little fluctuation in eve under the various rate shock scenarios 
we also forecast the impact of immediate and parallel interest rate shocks on net interest income under various scenarios to measure the sensitivity of our earnings under extreme conditions 
the quarterly simulation analysis is monitored against acceptable interest rate risk parameters by the asset liability committee and reported to the board of directors 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing and deposit gathering strategies  and client preferences
