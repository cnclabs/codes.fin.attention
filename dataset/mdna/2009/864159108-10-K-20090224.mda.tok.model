item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview sturm  ruger company  inc the company is principally engaged in the design  manufacture  and sale of firearms to domestic customers 
approximately of the company s total sales for the year ended december  were from the firearms segment  and approximately were from investment castings 
export sales represent approximately of firearms sales 
the company s design and manufacturing operations are located in the united states and most product content is domestic 
the company s firearms are sold through a select number of independent wholesale distributors principally to the commercial sporting market 
the company manufactures and sells investment castings made from steel alloys for both outside customers and internal use in the firearms segment 
investment castings sold to outside customers  either directly to or through manufacturers representatives  represented approximately of the company s total sales for the year ended december  in july  the company announced the cessation of the titanium castings portion of its investment casting operations 
this cessation of operations was completed in  at which time the company consolidated its arizona casting operations into its new hampshire casting operations 
because most of the company s competitors are not subject to public filing requirements and industry wide data is generally not available in a timely manner  the company is unable to compare its performance to other companies or specific current industry trends 
instead  the company measures itself against its own historical results 
the company does not consider its overall firearms business to be predictably seasonal  however  sales of many models of firearms are usually lower in the third quarter of the year 
results of operations annual summary unit data firearms unit data for orders  production  shipments and ending inventory  and castings setups a measure of foundry production are as follows units ordered   units produced     units shipped     average sales price units on backorder   units company inventory     units distributor inventory     castings setups     orders received and ending backlog in millions except average sales price  including federal excise tax orders received average sales price of orders received note ending backlog note average sales price of ending backlog note prior to  the company received one cancelable annual firearms order in december from each of its distributors 
effective december   the company changed the manner in which distributors order firearms  and began receiving firm  non cancelable purchase orders on a frequent basis  with most orders for immediate delivery 
because of this change  comparable data for orders received and units on backorder for prior periods is not meaningful 
distributor ending inventory as provided by the company s distributors 
average sales price for orders received and ending backlog is net of federal excise tax of for handguns and for long guns 
the increase in orders received in is attributable to the following increased demand for firearms during the fourth quarter  new products introduced in  and increased production and order fulfillment in the product mix of orders received in shows an increase in demand for firearms related to self defense  including the lcp pistol  which was introduced in the first quarter of the decrease in the average sales price of the units in backlog in is due to the large quantity of new products in the backlog with lower unit sales prices and a reduction in backlog for certain rifle products where production has increased to meet demand 
orders for certain discontinued models totaling million at the end of were cancelled and have been eliminated from the backlog information 
these orders were included in the backlog for  and their elimination had a significant impact on the change in average sales price of the ending backlog from to the increase in the order backlog is due to the strong incoming order rate for new products and the increase in overall demand that occurred in the fourth quarter 
shipments in will be essentially limited to units produced as finished goods inventory was largely depleted during the fourth quarter of production production rates  which started to increase late in  have continued to improve throughout this allowed for a increase in unit production from to the company continues to work on the transition from large scale batch production to lean manufacturing  with an emphasis on setting up manufacturing cells that facilitate flow production and pull systems 
the focus now is on establishing single piece flow cells for small parts manufacturing  refining existing cells  developing pull systems  managing vendors  and increasing capacity for the products with the greatest unmet demand 
there is also considerable  on going engineering work in process to re engineer existing product designs for improved manufacturability 
inventories the company s finished goods unit inventory levels decreased in  ending at a recent historic low 
finished goods inventories are anticipated to increase during the later half of as safety stock levels are rebuilt when the current  unusually high level of demand subsides

firearms unit shipments increased in due to increased shipments of pistols  rifles and revolvers 
this increase is attributable to the introduction of new products in  increased production of mature products  and increased overall industry demand 
a shift in product mix toward firearms with lower unit sales prices  including some new products  resulted in the greater percentage increase in unit shipments than sales 
casting segment net sales were million in this represents a decrease of million or from casting sales of million 
the casting sales decrease in primarily reflects the cessation of titanium casting operations  as previously announced by the company in july in  titanium casting sales were million of total casting sales

orders received the company saw unusually high bookings during the st quarter of and then unusually low bookings during the rd quarter of bookings picked up again during the th quarter  gaining strength during the quarter 
the company s distributors indicated anecdotally that this order pattern was in line with what the overall industry experienced during this order pattern in was more volatile than the modest seasonality typically encountered in other years 
certain product lines were on backorder throughout the year  including new product introductions and low volume products that were not in regular production throughout the year 
the company initiated sales promotions during the rd and th quarters of the year to encourage demand for those product lines where manufacturing capacity exceeded current demand 
production throughout  the company continued to work on the transition from large scale batch production to lean manufacturing  with an emphasis on setting up manufacturing cells that facilitate flow production and pull systems 
at the end of  the company had converted over of its batch manufacturing processes to single piece or small batch flow cells 
in the first half of  unit shipments exceeded production and there was a significant reduction in finished goods inventory 
there was also a significant reduction in work in process inventory in the first half of as available work in process inventory allowed the company to produce more units than its staffing and manufacturing processes would have otherwise allowed 
as a result of reducing gross inventory by million in the second half of and by million in the first half of  including significant reductions in work in process inventory  many issues with design for manufacturability  poor machinery and tool reliability  weak manufacturing processes  long machine changeover times  and vendor supply were identified 
the company has made partial progress in addressing these issues with careful re engineering of both our product and component designs and manufacturing processes as problems were identified  with the net result for certain product lines of significantly reduced factory throughput time  improved quality  and modestly improved productivity 
the rate of product returns from firearms in service less than year dropped by approximately from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of the company was also able to increase unit production by approximately from to during the nd half of  the company slowed its rapid  wide spread draw down of inventory and increased the foundry output to replenish component part shortages 
gross inventory was relatively unchanged during the nd half of production rates started to increase late in as a result of the months of effort spent addressing manufacturing process and design for manufacturability issues and as a result of the increased availability of investment cast component parts

excess and obsolete inventory prior to  the company adjusted production schedules to consume on hand raw material and wip inventories  regardless of customer demand for the finished goods so produced 
this practice led to increased investment in inventory  and an unbalanced finished goods inventory 
consistent with the change in the manner in which distributors order from the company  the company significantly changed its production scheduling philosophy from an annual production cycle to a customer demand pull system in the fourth quarter of under the company s new system  production is driven solely by customer demand 
as a result of this new production philosophy  it became apparent that the company had inventory in excess of its needs over the foreseeable future 
therefore  in  the company evaluated the adequacy of the excess and obsolescence inventory reserve and concluded that additional reserves were required to reflect the estimated recoverable value of excess inventories below lifo carrying cost 
the required reserve was estimated at million as of december  the company employed the same methodology and parameters in  which resulted in a reserve balance as of december  of million 
this reduction was principally caused by the increased impact of lifo in as evidenced by the lifo reserve representing of gross inventories at december   compared to at december  lifo in  gross inventories were reduced by million compared to decreases in gross inventories of million in the inventory reduction resulted in lifo income and decreased cost of products sold of million compared to lifo income and decreased cost of products sold of million in overhead rate change for the first three quarters of  the change in inventory value resulting from the change in the labor rates used to absorb labor expenses into inventory was a decrease in inventory of million  reflecting continued improvement of labor efficiency

the decrease in cash provided in compared to is principally attributable to a lesser reduction in gross inventory in compared to and an increase in accounts receivable in due to strong fourth quarter sales in the decrease in cash provided in compared to is principally a result of a lesser reduction in gross inventories in compared to third parties supply the company with various raw materials for its firearms and castings  such as fabricated steel components  walnut  birch  beech  maple and laminated lumber for rifle and shotgun stocks  wax  ceramic material  metal alloys  various synthetic products and other component parts 
there is a limited supply of these materials in the marketplace at any given time  which can cause the purchase prices to vary based upon numerous market factors 
the company believes that it has adequate quantities of raw materials in inventory to provide ample time to locate and obtain additional items at then current market cost without interruption of its manufacturing operations 
however  if market conditions result in a significant prolonged inflation of certain prices or if adequate quantities of raw materials can not be obtained  the company s manufacturing processes could be interrupted and the company s financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
investing and financing capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in  the company expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures to purchase tooling for new product introductions and to upgrade and modernize manufacturing equipment  and to increase capacity of certain products in strong demand

in  the company amended its hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans so that employees will no longer accrue benefits under them effective december  this action froze the benefits for all employees and prevented future hires from joining the plans  effective december  in  the company provided supplemental discretionary contributions to substantially all employees individual k accounts 
in late  after authorizing the freeze amendment to its hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans  the company contributed an additional million to the plans 
the intent of this discretionary contribution is to reduce the amount of time that the company will be required to continue to operate the frozen plans 
the ongoing cost of running the plans even if frozen is approximately  per year  which includes pbgc premiums  actuary and audit fees  and other expenses 
in and future years  the company may be required to make cash contributions to the two defined benefit pension plans according to the new rules of the pension protection act of the annual contributions will be based on the amount of the unfunded plan liabilities derived from the frozen benefits and will not include liabilities for any future accrued benefits for any new or existing participants 
the total amount of these future cash contributions will be dependent on the investment returns generated by the plans assets and the then applicable discount rates used to calculate the plans liabilities 
there is no minimum required cash contribution for the defined benefit plans for  but there may be such a requirement in future years because of recent market volatility which has adversely affected investment returns for the plans assets 
the cash contribution for the defined benefit plans is expected to be approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company settled million of pension liabilities through the purchases of group annuities 
this transaction resulted in an insignificant actuarial gain 
in february  the company made lump sum benefit payments to two participants in its only non qualified defined benefit plan  the supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
these payments  which totaled million  represented the actuarial present value of the participants accrued benefit as of the date of payment 
only one  retired participant remains in this plan

the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  upon the adoption of fin  the company commenced a review of all open tax years in all jurisdictions 
the company does not believe it has included any uncertain tax positions in its federal income tax return or any of the state income tax returns it is currently filing 
the company has made an evaluation of the potential impact of additional state taxes being assessed by jurisdictions in which the company does not currently consider itself liable 
the company does not anticipate that such additional taxes  if any  would result in a material change to its financial position 
however  the company anticipates that it is more likely than not that additional state tax liabilities in the range of to million exist 
the company had previously recorded million relating to these additional state income taxes  including approximately million for the payment of interest and penalties

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses recognized and incurred during the reporting period then ended 
the company bases estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances  and other assumptions  including those reviewed with actuarial consultants and independent counsel  when applicable  that are believed to be reasonable 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the determination of its product liability accrual is a critical accounting policy 
the company s management reviews every lawsuit and claim at the outset and is in contact with independent and corporate counsel on an ongoing basis 
the provision for product liability claims is based upon many factors  which vary for each case 
these factors include the type of claim  nature and extent of injuries  historical settlement ranges  jurisdiction where filed  and advice of counsel 
an accrual is established for each lawsuit and claim  when appropriate  based on the nature of each such lawsuit or claim 
amounts are charged to product liability expense in the period in which the company becomes aware that a claim or  in some instances a threat of claim  has been made when potential losses or costs of defense can be reasonably estimated 
such amounts are determined based on the company s experience in defending similar claims 
occasionally  charges are made for claims made in prior periods because the cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  exceed amounts already provided 
likewise credits may be taken if cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  are less than amounts previously provided 
while it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs  in the opinion of management  after consultation with independent and corporate counsel  it is not probable and is unlikely that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but may have a material impact on the company s financial results for a particular period 
the company believes the valuation of its inventory and the related excess and obsolescence reserve is also a critical accounting policy 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost  principally determined by the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and prevailing inventory costs existing at that time 
the company determines its excess and obsolescence reserve by projecting the year in which inventory will be consumed into a finished product 
given ever changing market conditions  customer preferences and the anticipated introduction of new products  it does not seem prudent nor supportable to carry inventory at full cost beyond that needed during the next months 
therefore  the company estimates its excess and obsolescence inventory reserve based on the following parameters projected year required of consumption reserve and thereafter recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued fas no

forward looking statements and projections the company may  from time to time  make forward looking statements and projections concerning future expectations 
such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain qualifying risks and uncertainties  such as market demand  sales levels of firearms  anticipated castings sales and earnings  the need for external financing for operations or capital expenditures  the results of pending litigation against the company including lawsuits filed by mayors  state attorneys general and other governmental entities and membership organizations  and the impact of future firearms control and environmental legislation  any one or more of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changing interest rates on its investments  which consists primarily of united states treasury instruments with short term less than one year maturities and cash 
the interest rate market risk implicit in the company s investments at any given time is low  as the investments mature within short periods and the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash 
the company has not undertaken any actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not materially impact the company s earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s investments
