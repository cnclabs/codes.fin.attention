item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary since the second quarter of  financial results for vital images  inc also referred to as we  us and our have been significantly affected by weakness in the computed tomography  or ct  and picture archiving and communication systems  or pacs  markets and by the broad impact of the deficit reduction act 
vital images  inc summary results were as follows total revenue of million  compared to million for gross margin of  compared to for operating expenses of million  compared to million for net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share 
total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million as of december   compared to million as of december  working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the decrease in cash and working capital during was primarily the result of repurchases of our common stock totaling million under a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in during  we continued to experience the effects of the industry wide slowdown in the high end ct market and the deficit reduction act that significantly impacted our results 
additionally  in we were impacted by the general decline in the us economy  which resulted in contracted capital spending by us hospitals and lower interest rates on our cash and investments 
we generated million of interest income in  compared to million in a decline in interest rates resulted in a return on investments in compared to a return on investments in we partially mitigated these negative factors by making progress on our transition to an enterprise company  as demonstrated by our introduction of vital enterprise in the second quarter  and by implementing significant cost control measures  including an workforce reduction in the fourth quarter 
we also responded by implementing a million share repurchase program  resulting in the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million during we further strengthened our strategic relationship with toshiba in  renewing our global distribution agreement through december  and  in january  entering into an agreement under which we will jointly develop applications 
our revenue from international sales grew in  and toshiba has been the primary source of our international growth

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below reflect significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors  including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific client reserves and the aging of our outstanding receivables 
a portion of this provision is included in operating expenses as a general and administrative expense and a portion of this provision is included as a reduction of license revenue 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors 
if the factors utilized in determining the allowance do not reflect future performance  then a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be necessary in the period such determination has been made  which would impact future results of operations 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  for gross accounts receivable of million 
deferred taxes significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
as of december   the consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of million 
considerations for determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets primarily involve cumulative pre tax income for financial reporting purposes  cumulative taxable income for the past three years  estimated future pre tax income for financial reporting purposes and estimated future taxable income from our core business 
we also consider the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits  and estimate the impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
as of december   the significant components of our deferred tax assets were as follows deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits of million  which is net of a valuation allowance of  relating to tax credits and certain state net operating loss carryforwards that expire prior to we will require approximately million in cumulative future taxable income to be generated at various times over the next years to realize the related deferred tax assets prior to expiration 
deferred tax asset related to equity based compensation of million 
many of the stock options related to this deferred tax asset are currently significantly out of the money and may expire unutilized during the next six years 
our projections of future taxable income have taken into consideration our expectations that a portion of these out of the money options will not result in future tax deductions and will not reduce future taxable income 
after giving consideration to the above factors  we concluded that the net deferred tax assets of million as of december  do not require any additional valuation allowance 
however  if we do not achieve a substantial improvement in pretax results in over  it is reasonably possible that we may need to establish additional valuation allowances for some or all of our deferred tax assets  which could materially impact our income tax provision  financial position and results of operations 

table of contents long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the undiscounted cash flows method is used to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset or asset groups  the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  determined using the discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on our best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment of million and other intangible assets subject to amortization of  as of december  a patent acquired in the hinnovation  inc acquisition having a  net book value as of december  is currently under review by the united states patent and trademark office uspto 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we operate as one reporting unit and therefore compare the book value to the market value consisting of market capitalization plus a control premium of 
as of december   we had million shares outstanding  a closing stock price of per share  a market value of million  and a book value of million  which would indicate that our goodwill was not impaired 
furthermore  based on december  data including million shares outstanding  our book value of million  and a control premium of  our stock price would need to trade below per share for a sustained period of time to indicate that our goodwill may be impaired 
if the market value exceeds the book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and thus the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if our book value exceeds the market value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
we completed the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of december   in which no impairment was identified 
goodwill was million as of december  if market conditions continue to fluctuate  we may incur goodwill impairment charges that adversely affect our financial position and operating results 
revenue recognition we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
we recognize revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab 
table of contents no 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
the significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
significant judgment is also required when evaluating and assessing revenue recognition relating to our distribution agreements with original equipment manufacturers  value added resellers and independent distributors collectively  resellers 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements  which must be analyzed to determine the fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
as a result  if facts and circumstances change that affect our current judgments  our revenue could be materially different in the future 
equity based compensation we recognize equity based compensation expense under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we recognize equity based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are input into the model 
these assumptions are the expected stock volatility  the risk free interest rate  the option s expected life and the dividend yield on the underlying stock 
expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected option life and other appropriate factors 
risk free interest rates are calculated based on continuously compounded us treasury risk free rates for the appropriate term 
prior to march   the expected life of stock options was calculated by performing a detailed analysis of all historical stock option information available 
on march   we began to grant options with a five year legal life instead of the eight year legal life that had historically been used 
as a result  we elected to use the simplified method  as described in sab no 
 to estimate the expected life of options granted on and after march  we will utilize the simplified method until sufficient historical information becomes available on the five year legal life options 
the dividend yield is assumed to be zero  as we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the expected forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards require the input of the subjective assumptions described above 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards represent management s best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of equity based compensation

we expect that revenue from vitrea licenses  vitrea options and third party software will continue to decrease in significance as compared to overall license fee revenue as sales of vital enterprise increase 
the decrease in license fee revenue during  as compared to  was driven primarily by a decrease in the number of vitrea licenses sold by our direct sales force  offset in part by new sales of vital enterprise  and by a greater percentage of license fee revenue from toshiba  which has lower revenue per license 
sales of vital enterprise also impact overall revenue mix  as a larger percentage of each vital enterprise sale is allocated to maintenance and services revenue than has historically been allocated for sales of vitrea

as in  we expect that in future periods  although sales of vital enterprise will result in proportionately lower license revenue upon sale  we will benefit from a recurring revenue stream from maintenance and services contracts 

table of contents the increase in maintenance and support revenue in was primarily driven by an increase in the number of customers on maintenance contracts  resulting from both new license sales and improvement in the percentage of our existing customers who went on maintenance contracts 
the increase in maintenance and support revenue in was primarily driven by an increase in the number of customers on maintenance contracts  as well as by increased pricing on maintenance and support 
decreased license sales in  compared to  and a general deferral of education sessions contributed to lower customer education revenue in professional services revenue  which includes installation and other implementation related services  increased due to an increase in services related to sales of vital enterprise 
the increase in customer education revenue and professional services revenue in was due in part to customer education revenue recognized in related to strong vitrea license sales near the end of hardware revenue hardware revenue increased to million  compared to million in  which was a decrease from million in we sell hardware as a convenience to our customers  and fluctuations are driven by individual customer purchasing preferences

maintenance and services gross margin increased during  compared to  as a larger percentage of each vital enterprise sale being allocated to maintenance and services revenue than has historically been allocated for sales of vitrea  without a corresponding increase in costs 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a  benefit to maintenance and support revenue arising from toshiba billing adjustments relating to historic periods 
we will continue to invest in our customer education  installation  professional services and customer support areas in the future to adequately support our growing installed base of customers 
gross margin for was relatively consistent with gross margin for hardware increased in  compared to and increased in  compared to variances in gross margin for hardware are expected  as hardware sales are not a substantial part of the sales strategy 
low volume can affect margins substantially 
during the third quarter  we recognized a  patent impairment charge related to a patent application acquired in the hinnovation  inc acquisition in february this patent application was rejected by the uspto

the impairment was recorded as a separate item in cost of revenue  and it is included in the total gross margin percentage above

the increase in expenses during was due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of additional personnel  higher travel and entertainment costs  and higher costs for attending us and european industry tradeshows 
commission expense for both and decreased due to lower direct revenue compared to the respective prior year expense

during  we required a significant amount of temporary consulting services to complete certain research and development activities  specifically in the area of software testing and validation 
we reduced these external expenses during by hiring additional research and development personnel 
in january  we entered into a co development and collaboration agreement with toshiba  in which we will enter into a mutual license of intellectual property and will jointly invest to develop and deliver innovative technology advancements for toshiba s modalities and vital images advanced visualization software solutions 
we do not expect the agreement will have a material impact on our research and development expense

table of contents we expect general and administrative expenses to be approximately to of total revenue for the year ending december  restructuring charge during  we continued to experience the effects of the industry wide slowdown in the high end ct market and the deficit reduction act that significantly impacted our results 
additionally  in  we were impacted by the general decline in the us economy  which resulted in contracted capital spending by us hospitals and lower interest rates on our cash and investments 
we reduced our workforce by approximately under a plan announced in november in order to align our operations with the current market conditions and improve profitability in and beyond 
we expect that the effect of the restructuring activities will reduce employee costs by approximately million to million in  compared to in connection with the reduction in workforce  we incurred certain charges in totaling  which were primarily comprised of employee severance and other termination costs 
the following table summarizes restructuring transactions and related liability balances in thousands severance and other termination costs balance at january  restructuring charges payments balance at december  actions with respect to the above activities were completed in the fourth quarter of  and we do not anticipate any additional charges related to the restructuring plan announced in november interest income we generated million of interest income in  compared to million in and million in a decline in interest rates resulted in a return on investments in compared to a and return on investments in and  respectively

income taxes our effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in our effective tax rates for  and were due primarily to the relative impact of research and development credits on lower pretax income in our effective income tax rate may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the relative proximity to breakeven of our results before taxes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources in thousands as of december  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital debt the decrease in our net cash position as of december   compared to december   is primarily due to million of share repurchases in under our million share repurchase program implemented in and completed in february on march   we announced an additional share repurchase program  authorizing up to an additional million shares to be repurchased on the open market 
we believe our existing cash and investments will satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements for at least the next months 
additionally  we believe our liquidity and strong balance sheet enable us to execute our repurchases of common stock while still investing in our enterprise solution and marketing strategy and remaining well positioned to pursue strategic acquisitions if and when they emerge 
we have investments in marketable securities that are classified and accounted for as available for sale 
market conditions during and indicate significant uncertainty on the part of investors on the economic outlook for the us and for financial institutions that have potential exposure to the sub prime housing market

summary of cash flows a summary of cash flows is as follows in thousands for the year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in  compared to  due to a million decrease in net income and a million decrease in non cash operating items  offset by a  increase due to the timing of other receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased  in  compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in net income  offset by a million increase in non cash operating items and a million increase due to the timing of other receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business 
investing activities we used million for cash and investing activities in net cash used by investing activities was million in net cash provided by investing activities was million in 
table of contents we used million  million and million for purchases of property and equipment in  and  respectively 
the purchases for all periods were principally to expand our facilities and upgrade computer equipment and to purchase computer equipment for new personnel 
additionally  in  we began the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system 
we continued implementation of the erp during and expect to continue to incur costs in future periods as we complete subsequent phases of the implementation 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment in the normal course of business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods are difficult to predict and depend on a number of factors  including the hiring of employees and the rate of change of computer hardware 
we used million  million and million to purchase investments in marketable securities during  and  respectively

total year or less to years to years more than years operating leases off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or purchase commitments we had no significant outstanding purchase orders as of december  we have entered into a number of technology licensing agreements that provide for the payment of royalties when we sell vitrea  vitalconnect and vital enterprise  we are not obligated for any minimum payments under such agreements 
foreign currency transactions our export sales are primarily negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars  with a portion of sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as we expand our direct business internationally  we expect to enter into a higher percentage of sales transactions in foreign currencies and could be subject to greater gains or losses based on exchange rate fluctuations 
inflation we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncement information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we do not enter into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates because  as disclosed above  our export sales are primarily negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars  with a small percentage of sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
based on the controls in place and the relative size of the financial instruments entered into  we believe the risks associated with not using these instruments would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we do not engage in speculative transactions and do not use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and price changes  which could affect our operating results 
interest rate risk we place our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which generally have a term of less than one year  with a high quality financial institution and have investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
if  during  average short term interest rates decreased by from average rates  based on our quarterly average balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our projected interest income from short term investments would have decreased by approximately million 
foreign currency risk our export sales are primarily negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars  with a portion of sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
therefore  fluctuations in the value of the dollar as compared to other foreign currencies have not had a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
as we expand our direct business internationally  we expect to enter into a higher percentage of sales transactions in foreign currencies and could be subject to greater gains or losses based on exchange rate fluctuations
