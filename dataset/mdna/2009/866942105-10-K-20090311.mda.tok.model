demand from the company s end markets was strong for the first three quarters of the year

current order levels in are as low as what we experienced at the end of and beginning of management is cognizant of the impact this recession has already had on the company s business and what a protracted global downturn will mean for its business levels going forward 
the company has already experienced the reduction of sales in december and  as evidenced by the forecast  this will extend throughout the first quarter of the reduced sales  coupled with the company s high fixed cost base  will ultimately result in a decrease in net income  which will exceed the decrease in sales
