this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business  its financial condition and its prospects 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview of business  business segments  results of operations and related information  adoption of new accounting pronouncements  liquidity and capital resources  and critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

table of contents overview of business we are a leading international producer of premium fine papers and technical products 
we have two primary operations our fine paper business and our technical products business 
we also own approximately  acres of timberlands in nova scotia  canada 
in managing our businesses  management believes that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets  responding effectively to competitive challenges  employing capital optimally  controlling costs and managing risks are important to long term success 
input costs for energy and raw materials and general economic conditions also impact our results 
in this discussion and analysis  we will refer to these factors 
market leadership 
achieving and maintaining leadership for our fine paper and technical products businesses has been an important part of our past performance 
our fine paper business has long been recognized as a leading manufacturer of world class premium writing  text and cover papers used in corporate identity packages  corporate annual reports  invitations  personal stationery and high end packaging 
our technical products business is recognized as a leading supplier in the tape  filtration  component materials  graphics and identification and wall covering markets 
maintaining our leadership is important to our results  particularly in light of the competitive environment in which we operate 
competitive environment 
our past results have been and future prospects will be significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets 
in most of our markets  our paper businesses compete directly with well known competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified 
cost control 
to improve and maintain our competitive position  we must control our raw material  manufacturing  distribution and other costs 
a portion of our investments in capital improvements are intended to achieve cost savings and improvements in productivity 
general economic conditions 
the markets for all of our products are affected to a significant degree by general economic conditions 
downturns and improvements in the us and european economies or in our export markets affect the demand for our products 
business segments our fine paper business is a leading producer of premium writing  text  cover and specialty papers used in corporate identity packages  corporate annual reports  invitations  personal stationery and high end packaging 
our products include some of the most recognized and preferred papers in north america  where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories 
we sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors  converters and specialty businesses  with sales to distributors and distributor owned paper stores accounting for approximately percent of sales 
we believe that our fine paper manufacturing facilities located in appleton  neenah and whiting  wisconsin  and ripon  california are among the most efficient in their markets and make us one of the lowest cost producers 
our technical products business is a leading producer of transportation and other filter media  durable  saturated and coated base papers for a variety of end uses and nonwoven wall coverings 
we sell our technical products globally via five sbus in product categories  and we focus on major categories where we believe we are a market leader  which include  among others  the tape  label  abrasive  transportation and other filter media  nonwoven wall coverings  medical packaging and image transfer technical products markets 
we are also a global supplier of materials used for customer specific applications in furniture  book covers and original equipment manufacturers products 
our customers are located in more than countries 
our technical products manufacturing facilities are located in munising  michigan and near munich and frankfurt  germany 
results of operations and related information in this section  we discuss and analyze our net sales  income before interest and income taxes which we refer to as operating income in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations for the years ended december   and 
table of contents executive summary strategic initiatives during the previous three years  we completed several complementary initiatives in line with our strategy to transition to a premium technical products and fine paper company 
in and  we sold  acres of woodlands in nova scotia  divested our terrace bay pulp operations  acquired the german technical and specialty paper business of fibermark  inc and purchased fox river 
in february  we committed to a plan to sell the pictou mill and the woodlands 
in june  neenah canada sold the pictou mill to northern pulp  a new operating company jointly owned by atlas holdings llc and blue wolf capital management llc 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction  northern pulp assumed all of the assets and liabilities associated with the pictou mill  as well as existing customer contracts  supply agreements including the pulp supply agreement with kimberly clark  labor agreements and pension obligations 
the sale did not include the woodlands 
in conjunction with the sale of the pictou mill  we entered into a stumpage agreement the stumpage agreement which allows northern pulp to harvest an average of approximately  metric tons of softwood timber annually from the woodlands 
the stumpage agreement is for a term of ten years and northern pulp has the option to extend the agreement for an additional three years 
for calendar year  northern pulp paid a nominal amount for approximately  metric tons of softwood timber harvested under the stumpage agreement 
for timber purchases during calendar year  northern pulp has agreed to pay the then current stumpage rate charged by the nova scotia provincial government for harvesting on government licensed lands 
the price paid for all subsequent purchases will be based on an agreed upon formula for estimating market prices 
we believe the stumpage agreement prices for calendar and beyond represent market rates 
northern pulp has agreed to pay substantially all costs associated with maintaining the woodlands and harvesting the timber 
an agreement to sell the woodlands will be subject to the terms of the stumpage agreement 
we believe it is probable that a sale of the woodlands will occur within months 
we expect to recognize a substantial gain on the sale of the woodlands 
upon consummation of the sale of the woodlands  we will have completely divested our pulp manufacturing operations and the revenues of our remaining businesses will be almost evenly divided between fine paper and technical products 
in addition  we will have significantly changed the profile of our company by eliminating our pulp operations in favor of higher growth  more profitable and less capital intensive specialty paper businesses 
results of continuing operations for the year ended december   our consolidated net sales decreased approximately million from the prior year period to million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower volumes in both our businesses  especially in the fourth quarter  partially offset by the realization of price increases and favorable currency translation effects due to the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar 
for the year ended december   we incurred a consolidated operating loss of million compared to operating income in the prior year of million 
the operating loss in the current year was primarily due to the recognition of a non cash pre tax charge of million for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets assigned to neenah germany 
see executive summary impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
excluding the impairment charge  consolidated operating income for the year ended december  of million was million unfavorable to the prior year primarily due to increased manufacturing input costs of approximately million  decreased volumes and less favorable fixed cost absorption due to reduced operating schedules 
these factors were partially offset by gains from the sale of certain assets acquired in the fox river acquisition and the benefits of higher net prices 
the reduced volumes were primarily a result of weaker market demand in  particularly in the fourth quarter  due in part to weakening economic conditions  as well as reduced exports from germany as a result of the stronger euro 
for the three months ended december   our consolidated net sales decreased approximately million from the prior year period to million 
the decrease was due to lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation effects due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro partially offset by higher average prices 
the reduced volumes were a result of substantially weaker market demand in the fourth quarter of due to weakening economic conditions 
for the three months ended december   we incurred a consolidated operating loss of million compared to consolidated operating income of million in the prior year 
the unfavorable comparison to the prior year was primarily due to lower volumes  increased manufacturing input costs and manufacturing inefficiencies as a result reduced paper machine operating schedules to control inventory 
these unfavorable factors were only partially offset by higher average selling prices and reductions in administrative costs 

table of contents we expect that the recent uncertainty in the credit markets and global economic weakness will continue to negatively affect customer demand for many of our products 
however  we anticipate that the slowdown in global economic activity will also result in a decrease in costs for manufacturing inputs  particularly pulp  energy and latex that adversely affected operating results 
we have not yet observed any significant reduction in the ability of our customers to make payments in a timely manner or in the ability of our vendors to provide products and services due to the availability of credit 
however  there can be no assurance that our customers or vendors will not experience such problems 
results of discontinued operations for the year ended december   net sales of discontinued operations decreased approximately million from the prior year period to million 
the decrease was due to the sale of the pictou mill in june resulting in only six months of pulp sales in the current year versus months of pulp sales in the prior year period 
for the year ended december   we recognized a pre tax loss from discontinued operations of million compared to a pre tax loss of million in the prior year period 
the pre tax loss in the current year was primarily due to recognition of non cash charges of million to write off the long lived assets of the pictou mill 
in addition  we recognized a pre tax loss of million for the loss on disposal of the pictou mill 
the loss on disposal included a non cash charge of million for the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income of deferred adjustments related to pensions and other postretirement benefits in connection with the transfer of postretirement benefit plans for the pictou mill to northern pulp 
the pre tax loss in the prior year includes a non cash charge of million related to settlement of the terrace bay ontario  canada defined benefit pension plan the ontario plan 
excluding the impairment charge  the estimated loss on disposal and the loss on settlement of the ontario plan  the pre tax loss from operations for the year ended december  was million compared to pre tax income of million in the prior year 
the unfavorable comparison to the prior year was primarily due to higher fiber and other input costs and unfavorable currency translations effects  partially offset by higher softwood pulp prices 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment at least annually on november in conjunction with preparation of our annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate goodwill might be impaired 
our annual test of goodwill for impairment at november   indicated that the carrying value of the neenah germany reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
for the year ended december   we recognized a pre tax loss of million the company did not recognize a tax benefit related to the impairment loss which was not deductible for us or german income taxes for the impairment of goodwill assigned to the neenah germany reporting unit 
the impairment loss was primarily due to a substantial increase in the estimated cost of capital we used to calculate the present value of neenah germany s estimated future cash flows which resulted in a substantially lower estimated fair value 
the higher estimated cost of capital reflected current market financial conditions at the time the annual impairment test was performed which indicated higher risk premiums for debt and equity 
during our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment  we determined that certain trade names and customer based intangible assets were also impaired at december  for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash pre tax charge of approximately million for the impairment of such assets 
see critical accounting policies and use of estimates impairment of long lived assets 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision related to continuing operations of million compared to an income benefit of million in the prior year period 
as a result  our effective income tax benefit rate for the years ended december  and was approximately percent and percent  respectively 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  primarily reflected the non tax deductible nature of the goodwill impairment charge 
excluding the impairment charge  our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was percent primarily due to the benefits of our corporate tax structure and the proportion of pre tax income in jurisdictions with different marginal tax rates 
these benefits were partially offset by an increase in the limitation on available tax benefits acquired in the fox river acquisition 
during the year ended december   german tax laws were amended to reduce statutory income tax rates effective as of january  application of the new rates to our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities reduced our net deferred tax liabilities at december  the reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities due to the benefit of the tax rate change resulted in an income tax benefit of million and was treated as a discrete item for the year ended december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes and had no further impact on our effective tax rate in excluding the impact of the german tax law amendment on our deferred tax liabilities and other tax adjustments  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately percent 

table of contents adoption of new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp 
fsp defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we do not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value that require disclosure under sfas pursuant to fsp  we will provide the disclosures required by sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis beginning january  on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
most of the provisions of sfas apply only to entities that elect the fair value option 
however  the amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
our adoption of sfas did not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows because we did not elect any new fair value measurements of financial assets or financial liabilities

table of contents consolidated net sales of million in the year ended december  were million lower than the prior year primarily due to lower volumes and a less favorable product mix in our fine paper business  partially offset by the realization of price increases and favorable currency translation effects due to the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar 
consolidated net sales for the three months ended december  were million unfavorable to the prior year period primarily due to steep declines in general economic conditions and market demand 
net sales in our fine paper business of million decreased million or percent primarily due to a percent decrease in shipments 
the lower volume was primarily due to an unusually large market decline in for premium uncoated free sheet papers as a result of weaker economic conditions  partially offset by incremental sales related to the acquisition of fox river in march the increase in average net price reflected increased selling prices for most products that were partially offset by a less favorable mix 
the less favorable mix was primarily due to the dilutive nature of the relatively lower priced grades acquired with fox river 
net sales in our technical products business of million decreased million or percent  primarily due to lower volumes for certain products that were partially offset by favorable currency effects and higher net prices 
net prices increased approximately percent on average due to a more favorable mix and higher selling prices 
the mix reflected an increased proportion of sales of higher priced products such as filtration and abrasives 
volumes declined primarily due to weaker economic conditions and lower export tape sales from germany as a result of the strengthening of the euro 
year versus change in net sales compared to the prior year change due to total change volume average net price fine paper technical products intersegment sales consolidated consolidated net sales of million in the year ended december  were million higher than the prior year primarily as a result of increased volume due to the acquisitions of neenah germany and fox river 
in addition  the current year benefited from the realization of price increases in our technical products business  partially offset by a less favorable product mix in our fine paper business 
net sales in our fine paper business of million increased million or percent as shipment volume improved more than percent primarily due to the acquisition of fox river 
the benefit from higher volume was partially offset by lower average net price resulting from a less favorable product mix due to selling a higher proportion of lower priced grades  primarily fox river grades  partially offset by improved pricing for branded products 
net sales in our technical products business of million increased million or more than double the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of neenah germany  and to a lesser extent  improved product mix  favorable currency effects due to a stronger euro relative to the us dollar and prices 
the improvement in average net price reflected a more favorable product mix due to higher priced grades representing a larger proportion of sales and increased selling prices for most products

table of contents for the year ended december   we incurred a consolidated operating loss of million primarily due to a non cash pre tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge of million 
excluding the asset impairment charge  consolidated operating income for the year ended december  decreased million compared to primarily due to increased manufacturing input costs that exceeded selling price increases in both businesses  lower volumes and a less favorable mix of products in our fine paper business 
these unfavorable factors also more than offset benefits related to improved manufacturing operations  lower administrative costs  gains related to the sale of certain assets acquired in the acquisition of fox river and gains on the settlement of certain employee benefit liabilities that we retained following the sale of terrace bay 
consolidated operating income for the three months ended december  was million unfavorable to the prior year period due to steep declines in general economic conditions and market demand that resulted in lower sales and downtime at our facilities to manage inventory levels 
operating income for our fine paper business of million decreased million primarily due to higher manufacturing input costs  principally for hardwood pulp and energy  a less favorable product mix due to the dilutive effect of selling relatively lower priced grades acquired in the fox river acquisition and lower volumes 
these unfavorable factors were only partially offset by gains on asset sales of approximately million  higher selling prices  improved manufacturing efficiencies and incremental volume related to the acquisition of fox river 
our technical products business incurred an operating loss of million for the current year due to a non cash pre tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge of million 
excluding the asset impairment charge  operating income for our technical products business of million decreased million from the prior year primarily due to higher manufacturing input costs and lower volume 
the increase in manufacturing costs primarily reflected higher input prices for energy  pulp and latex and increased costs in germany following the start up of new and rebuilt assets 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by improved pricing and mix  improved manufacturing operations and the favorable translation impact from a stronger euro relative to the us dollar 
unallocated corporate expenses decreased million primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain employee benefit liabilities that we retained following the sale of our terrace bay pulp mill and due to decreased spending for other corporate expenses

these factors were partially offset by increased manufacturing input costs 
the benefit of increased volume in our fine paper business associated with the acquisition of fox river was largely offset by a less favorable product mix  direct selling and administrative expenses of fox river and costs related to the integration of fox river 

table of contents operating income for our fine paper business of million decreased million from the prior year primarily due to higher fiber and other costs 
the increase in other costs was primarily due to higher distribution costs  additional direct selling and administrative expenses for the fox river business and approximately million in costs related to the integration of fox river and our existing fine paper operations 
in addition  approximately million of profits associated with the fox river acquisition were capitalized as part of beginning inventory values under purchase accounting 
these unfavorable factors were only partially offset by the combined factors of increased volume and a less favorable product mix related to the acquisition of fox river and higher average selling prices 
operating income for our technical products business of million increased million from the prior year primarily as a result of the incremental earnings of neenah germany  including favorable currency effects due to a stronger euro relative to the us dollar  and favorable average net price  partially offset by higher fiber costs 
favorable average prices were primarily due to an improved product mix and higher selling prices for most products

liquidity and capital resources year ended december  net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities capital expenditures other investing activities total financing activities operating cash flow commentary cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  was million lower than cash provided by operating activities in the prior year 
the unfavorable comparison to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in cash used by operating activities of our discontinued pulp operations of approximately million  lower earnings excluding the effects of non cash items and increased investments in working capital in the current year 

table of contents our investment in operating working capital at december  of million was million higher than the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to classifying the deferred tax consequences related to the woodlands as current deferred income taxes to conform to the classification of the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations as current assets and liabilities 
in general  such amounts were classified as noncurrent deferred income taxes as of december  our investment in operating working capital at december  of million was million higher than the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to working capital acquired in the fox river acquisition and currency effects related to the strengthening of the canadian dollar and the euro relative to the us dollar 
cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  increased million from the prior year primarily due to higher earnings excluding the effects of non cash items  partially offset by the liquidation of terrace bay working capital in the improvement in earnings was primarily due to the added earnings of neenah germany  higher selling prices  particularly for softwood pulp and an improved sales mix in our technical products business 
cash provided by working capital for the year ended december  of million compares to no change in working capital in cash used for working capital in was primarily the result of higher accounts receivable for neenah germany and our pulp business  partially offset by an increase in amounts payable for income taxes and interest and foreign currency effects 
investing commentary for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million  a decrease of million versus the prior year period 
the decrease in cash used was primarily due to spending of million for the acquisition of fox river in capital spending for the year ended december  was million compared to spending of million in the comparable prior year period 
the reduction in capital spending is primarily due to expenditures in for major projects to increase capacity and improve efficiency at neenah germany and for capital projects in our pulp business 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities includes payments by neenah canada of approximately million to northern pulp in connection with the transfer of the pictou mill 
in addition  we paid approximately million in transaction costs 
such payments were more than offset by proceeds of million  primarily from the sale of surplus fox river assets 
we have aggregate planned capital expenditures for of less than million 
these capital expenditures are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million versus cash used in investing activities of million in the prior year 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to spending of million for the acquisition of fox river and capital expenditures of million 
cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was primarily due to the acquisition of neenah germany for million net of cash acquired and a payment of million to buchanan to transfer the terrace bay mill  partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of woodlands of million 
capital expenditures of million for the year ended december  more than doubled from the prior year 
capital expenditures in the year ended december  were primarily for major projects to increase capacity and improve efficiency at neenah germany 
in general  our capital expenditures in neenah germany were financed from locally generated cash flow and government subsidized financing 
financing commentary our liquidity requirements are provided by cash generated from operations  short and long term borrowings and proceeds from asset sales 
availability under our bank revolving credit facility varies over time depending on the value of our inventory  receivables and various capital assets 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  outstanding letters of credit of million and million of available credit 
we expect that jp morgan chase  na and the other lenders listed in our credit agreement will continue to honor their commitment to provide funds in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement 
in june  we entered into the sixth amendment to the bank credit agreement in which the lenders consented to the sale of the pictou mill 
in june  we entered into the first amendment to a term loan agreement which reduced required amortization payments to million per quarter 
all remaining amounts outstanding under the term loan are due and payable upon termination of the agreement in november 
table of contents during the year ended december   we amended our bank credit agreement to increase available borrowing capacity under our bank revolving credit facility from to million 
despite the increase in the total commitment  our ability to borrow under the bank revolving credit facility is limited to the lowest of a million  b our borrowing base as defined in the credit agreement  and c the applicable cap on the amount of credit facilities under the indenture for our senior notes 
for the year ended december   additional net borrowings on our bank revolving credit facility were million primarily to finance our increased investment in operating working capital  our purchase of common stock million in connection with a reverse forward split of common stock and our regular quarterly dividends million 
for the year ended december   additional net borrowings on our german revolving line of credit were million million 
for the year ended december   we prepaid approximately million in term loan borrowings with the proceeds from the sale of certain fox river assets 
for each of the years ended december   and  we paid cash dividends of per share or million  million and million  respectively 
we have required debt payments for the year ended december  are million 
such payments include required amortization payments on our term loan and german construction financing of approximately million and million  respectively  and million on our german unsecured revolving line of credit which we expect to refinance in november we expect to make required pension contributions of approximately million in calendar compared to contributions to pension trusts of million in calendar which included contributions of approximately million to the nova scotia plan 
we have approximately million in refundable us income taxes that are expected to be received in the next months 
in addition  we do not expect to pay us income taxes for the next three calendar years as a result of the utilization of net operating losses 
management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund working capital  capital spending and other cash needs for the next months 
our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond will depend on  among other things  our ability to successfully implement our business strategies  control costs in line with market conditions and manage the impact of changes in input prices and currencies 
we can give no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these items 
contractual obligations the following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of december  in millions beyond total minimum purchase commitments long term debt payments interest payments on long term debt other postretirement benefit obligations operating leases open purchase orders contributions to pension trusts liability for uncertain tax positions total contractual obligations 
table of contents the minimum purchase commitments in are primarily for natural gas contracts 
although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and minimum purchase commitments  based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows  we believe our exposure to losses  if any  under these arrangements is not material 
interest payments on long term debt includes interest on variable rate debt at december  weighted average interest rates 
the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next months for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery 
the above table includes future payments that we will make for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions  including expected future service  to project the future obligations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used 
these critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of neenah s financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
in general  our shipments are designated free on board shipping point and we recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
sales are reported net of allowable discounts and estimated returns 
reserves for cash discounts  trade allowances and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
inventories we value us inventories at the lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method for financial reporting purposes  or market 
german inventories are valued at the lower of cost  using either the first in  first out fifo or a weighted average cost method  or market 
the fifo value of us inventories valued on the lifo method was million and million at december  and  respectively and exceeded such lifo value by million and million  respectively 
cost includes labor  materials and production overhead 
as of december   we had no canadian pulp inventories 
as of december   canadian pulp inventories were million and consisted of both roundwood logs and wood chips 
these inventories were located both at the pulp mills and at various timberlands locations 
income taxes as of december   we have recorded aggregate deferred income tax assets of million related to temporary differences  and have established no valuation allowances against these deferred income tax assets 
as of december   our aggregate deferred income tax assets were million 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider many factors  including specific taxing jurisdictions  sources of taxable income  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance would be recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   our liability for uncertain income taxes positions was million 
in evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  we consider many factors which may result in periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
pension benefits substantially all active employees of our us paper operations participate in defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans 
in november  we assumed responsibility for pension and postretirement benefit obligations for active employees of the pulp and paper business and former employees of the pulp business in canada 
in august  neenah canada purchased annuity contracts to settle its obligations under the ontario plan for former employees of terrace bay 
in july  the financial services commission of ontario approved our request to settle our pension obligations for active employees and terminate the ontario plan 
in december  the ontario plan was terminated and all outstanding pension obligations were settled through the purchase of annuity contracts or lump sum payments pursuant to participant elections 
in conjunction with the sale of the pictou mill  northern pulp assumed responsibility for all pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for active and retired employees of the mill 
the company accounted for the transfer of these liabilities as a settlement of postretirement benefit obligations pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
substantially all of neenah germany s employees participate in defined benefit plans designed to provide a monthly pension benefit upon retirement 
our funding policy for qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation  as required by the pension protection act 
subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall is to be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the taxing authorities are not funded 
there is no legal or governmental obligation to fund neenah germany s benefit plans and as such the plans are currently unfunded 
consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pension expense for the year ended december   excludes a non cash  pre tax settlement loss of million due to the reclassification of deferred pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments related to the transfer of the nova scotia plan to northern pulp from accumulated other comprehensive income to loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
pension expense for the year ended december   includes million for losses related to the settlement of pension obligations for active employees in the ontario plan 
in addition  we recognized a reduction in pension expense of million related to an amendment to the fox river defined benefit pension plan to freeze the vested pension benefit for salaried employees born after december  pension expense for the year ended december   includes million for settlement and curtailment losses related to the settlement of pension obligations for current retirees in the ontario plan 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors  including input from pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered the plans historical year and year compounded annual returns 
we anticipate that on average the investment managers for both our us and canadian plans will generate annual long term rates of return of at least percent 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about percent with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately percent  and percent with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of about percent 
the actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we evaluate our investment strategy and long term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually 
pension expense is estimated based on the fair value of assets rather than a market related value that averages gains and losses over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of the assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
the variance between the actual and the expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a market related value for plan assets was used 
as of december   our pension plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately million 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under sfas  employers accounting for pensions 

table of contents the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the us is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of aa rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place  whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in canada is generally based on the government of canada long bond rate plus the spread for a long term aa rated bond index over the yield on year us treasury bonds converted to an equivalent one year compound basis 
the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the present value of future pension obligations at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
our consolidated pension expense in is based on the expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets and the weighted average discount rate described above and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  our contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
as of december   our actuarially determined pension expense for the year ended december   will be approximately million 
the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans at december  of approximately million decreased approximately million from the fair value of about million at december   due to the transfer of assets of million to northern pulp in connection with the sale of the pictou mill 
pension plan assets also decreased due to investment losses  benefit payments and currency effects 
at december   the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million which was approximately million larger than the million deficit at december  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
contributions to pension trusts for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  in addition  we made direct benefit payments for unfunded supplemental retirement benefits of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre tax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre tax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
all of our goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of neenah germany in october under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
a fair value based test is applied at the reporting unit level  which is generally one level below the segment level 
the test compares the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
this test requires various judgments and estimates 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a market approach in combination with a probability weighted discounted operating cash flow approach for a number of scenarios representing differing operating and economic assumptions 
we will record an adjustment to goodwill for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 

table of contents impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually on november in conjunction with preparation of our annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
certain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas other intangible assets with finite lives acquired intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships  trade names and acquired intellectual property 
such intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of between and years 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets our annual test of goodwill for impairment at november   indicated that the carrying value of the neenah germany reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
we estimated fair value using a market approach in combination with a probability weighted discounted operating cash flow approach for a number of scenarios representing differing operating and economic assumptions 
significant assumptions used in developing the discounted operating cash flow approach were revenue growth rates and pricing  costs for manufacturing inputs  levels of capital investment and estimated cost of capital for high  medium and low growth environments 
we measured the estimated fair value of goodwill as the excess of the carrying amount of the neenah germany reporting unit over the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
we recorded an impairment adjustment to goodwill for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of goodwill 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash pre tax loss of million for the impairment of goodwill assigned to the neenah germany reporting unit 
we did not recognize a tax benefit related to the non tax deductible loss 
as of december   the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the neenah germany reporting unit was considered recoverable 
the impairment loss was primarily due to a substantial increase in the estimated cost of capital we used to calculate the present value of neenah germany s estimated future cash flows which resulted in a substantially lower estimated fair value 
the higher estimated cost of capital reflected current market financial conditions at the time the annual impairment test was performed which indicated higher risk premiums for debt and equity 
as of december   a one percentage point increase in the estimate for our cost of capital used in the impairment test would result in an approximately million change in the estimated fair value of the neenah germany reporting unit and a corresponding reduction in the implied value of goodwill 
during our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment  we determined that certain trade names and customer based intangible assets were also impaired at december  for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash pre tax charge of approximately million for the impairment of such assets 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
stock based compensation cost recognized under sfas r consists of a compensation cost for all unvested stock based grants outstanding as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and b compensation cost for all stock based awards granted subsequent to adoption based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the amount of stock based compensation cost recognized is based on the fair value of grants that are ultimately expected to vest and is recognized pro rata over the requisite service period for the entire award 
sfas r amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows  to require the reporting of excess tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock based awards as cash provided by financing activities rather than as a reduction in income taxes paid and reported as cash provided by operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to risks such as changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and environmental regulation 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
presented below is a description of our most significant risks 
foreign currency risk our reported operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rates of the euro relative to the us dollar 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical percent decrease in the exchange rates of the euro relative to the u 
s dollar would have decreased our income before income taxes by approximately million 
our exposure to such exchange risk on reported operating results is not hedged 
currency transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro 
we performed a sensitivity test to quantify the effects that possible changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar would have on our pre tax income based on the transactional exposure at december  the effect is calculated by multiplying our net monetary asset or liability position by a percent change in the exchange rate of the euro versus the us dollar 
the results of this sensitivity test are as follows 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in net pre tax losses of approximately million 
finally  the translation of the balance sheets of our german operations from euros into us dollars also is sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro 
consequently  we performed a sensitivity test to determine if changes in the exchange rate would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our german operations into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta  a component of comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of our german operations by a percent change in the us euro exchange rates 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro would have decreased our stockholders equity by approximately million 
the hypothetical increase in uta is based on the difference between the december  exchange rate and the assumed exchange rate 
prior to the sale of the pictou mill  our results of operations and cash flows were affected by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
from time to time  we used hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
following the sale of the pictou mill  the risk that our results of operations and cash flows will be affected by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the us dollar has been substantially reduced 
at december  we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in a notional amount of million canadian dollars 
the fair value of the contracts was a current asset of million us dollars 
commodity risk pulp we purchase the wood pulp used to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over the price paid for our wood pulp purchases 
therefore  an increase in wood pulp prices could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
based on pulp purchases  a percent increase in the average market price for pulp approximately per ton would have increased our annual costs for pulp purchases by approximately million 
prior to the sale of the pictou mill  our results of operations  cash flows and financial position were sensitive to the selling prices of wood pulp 
from time to time  we used hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to pulp price fluctuations 
at december  and  we had no outstanding pulp future contracts 

table of contents other manufacturing inputs we purchase a substantial portion of the other manufacturing inputs necessary to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over our costs for such manufacturing inputs 
therefore  an increase in other manufacturing inputs could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
while we believe that alternative sources of critical supplies would be available  an interruption in supply of single source specialty grade latex or specialty softwood pulp to our technical products business could disrupt and eventually cause a shutdown of production of certain technical products 
we generate substantially all of the electrical energy used by our munising mill and approximately percent of the electrical energy at our bruckm hl and appleton mills 
availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future  but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on fluctuations in demand and other factors 
there is no assurance that that we will be able to obtain electricity or natural gas purchases on favorable terms in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate long term debt and our variable rate bank debt 
at december   we had million of long term fixed rate debt outstanding and million of long term variable rate borrowings outstanding 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt resulting from changes in market interest rates  but not to fluctuations in our earnings or cash flows 
at december   the fair market value of our fixed rate long term debt was million based upon the quoted market price of the senior notes or rates currently available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate borrowings by approximately million 
we could in the future  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt by entering into interest rate hedging arrangements  although those arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
environmental regulation our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation primarily by us  canada  germany and other international authorities 
we have made significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
due to changes in environmental laws and regulations  the application of such regulations and changes in environmental control technology  we are not able to predict with certainty the amount of future capital spending to be incurred for environmental purposes 
taking these uncertainties into account  we have planned capital expenditures for environmental projects during the period through of approximately million to million annually 
we believe these risks can be managed and will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
