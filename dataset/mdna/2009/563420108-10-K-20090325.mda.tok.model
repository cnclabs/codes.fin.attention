overview historically  the company designed  developed  and built specialty testing assembly equipment for the automotive and heavy equipment industries that identifies defects through the use of signature analysis and in process verification 
in fiscal  the company completed two acquisitions that introduced lifting equipment into the company operations as a second segment of activity 
effective july   the company completed the purchase of manitex  inc manitex subsidiary via an acquisition of all of the membership interests in quantum value management  llc an entity owned by certain stockholders 
a leading provider of 
table of contents engineered lift solutions in north america  the manitex subsidiary is based in georgetown  texas 
the manitex subsidiary designs  manufactures  and markets a comprehensive line of boom trucks  sign cranes and trolley boom unloaders 
manitex s boom trucks and crane products are primarily used for industrial projects  energy exploration  and infrastructure development including roads  bridges and commercial construction 
on november   the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  manitex liftking  ulc  an alberta unlimited liability corporation manitex liftking completed the acquisition the liftking acquisition of all of the operating assets of liftking industries  inc an ontario  canada corporation liftking 
manitex liftking is headquartered in woodbridge toronto  ontario and manufactures a complete line of rough terrain forklifts and special mission oriented vehicles  as well as other specialized carriers  heavy material handling transporters  and steel mill equipment 
on july   the company further expanded its lifting equipment segment by purchasing the noble forklift product line 
the noble product line is comprised of four rough terrain forklifts in several configurations  which are being produced in the company s existing facilities located in georgetown  texas and woodbridge  ontario 
although the revenues for the noble product were not significant in the company believes that the acquisition will allow the company to increase its market penetration in the future 
on october   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of schaeff lift truck inc schaeff and crane machinery  inc crane from gt distribution  llc 
schaeff  which produces a line of stand up electric forklifts  further expands the lifting equipment segment 
crane is a chicago area based distributor of terex and manitex cranes and is a separate new segment  entitled equipment distribution 
against the background of the operating losses generated in recent history by the testing assembly equipment segment operations based at wixom  michigan  the company conducted a strategic review of these operations 
in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements  the board determined that certain assets used in connection with our testing assembly equipment segment were impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
on march   our board of directors approved a plan to sell our testing assembly equipment segment s operating assets including its inventory  machinery  equipments and patents 
as a result  our testing assembly equipment segment has been accounted for as a discontinued operation starting with the first quarter of until its disposition 
on july  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with euromaint industry  inc  a delaware corporation euromaint 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the company agreed to sell and euromaint agreed to purchase certain assets of the company used in connection with the company s diesel engine testing equipment business 
euromaint also assumed and agreed to pay  perform and discharge when due certain obligations of the company arising in connection with the operation of the company s diesel engine testing equipment business 
in addition to the assumption of those certain assumed liabilities  euromaint agreed to pay to the company the aggregate purchase price of million 
this transaction was completed on august  as of august   all operations of the company s testing assembly equipment segment had ceased 
the testing assembly equipment segment operated from a leased facility 
the lease termination date for this facility was august  as a result of the company s decision to sell the testing assembly equipment segment  the results of this operation have been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
as result of discontinuing our testing assembly equipment segment  the company operated in only a single business segment  lifting equipment  until october  when the company acquired crane 
as noted above  crane is a chicago area based distributor of terex and manitex cranes and is a separate new segment  entitled equipment distribution 
the company  except for our equipment distribution segment  derives most of its revenue from purchase orders from dealers and distributors 
our equipment distribution segment is a distributor  who sells its products principally to the end user 
historically  the demand for the company s products has depended upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which the company competes 
the company s sales depend in part upon its customers replacement 
table of contents or repair cycles 
adverse economic conditions  including a decrease in commodity prices  has caused customers in the past to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery 
the distress in the financial markets that occurred in the later part of is unprecedented 
the immediate impact was a dramatic decrease in liquidity and credit availability throughout the world 
an incredibly rapid and significant deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe followed 
the deterioration in economic conditions is ongoing and the ultimate extent of the current recession and the timing of the recovery is unknown 
the actions of the united states and other world governments to stimulate the world economy are also unprecedented 
the united states stimulus package includes very significant appropriations for improving the country s infrastructure  which could be a significant benefit to the company 
the ultimate success of governmental actions and the resulting benefits that the company may see  however  remain unknown 
the above described events had an immediate significant adverse impact on the company  including a very dramatic curtailment of new orders  as well as requests to delay delivery and  in some cases  the cancellation of existing orders 
some of our dealers were not able to access their existing credits lines which delayed their payments 
it appears that our dealers currently have access to their existing credit lines or have been able to replace them with new lines 
the company does not currently expect the distress in the credit markets to result in the company incurring any significant uncollectible accounts 
the depth and length of the recession is unknown  however  and could result in dealers being unable to stay in business 
the company retains a security interest in the cranes it sells in the united states until payment is received  which the company expects will mitigate the financial impact to it of dealers going out of business 
our backlog as of december   was million  a reduction of million from the december  backlog of million 
based on a significant reduction in our backlog and anticipating the impact of economic conditions and longer sales cycles  we determined that swift management action was necessary to ensure that we balance operating activity with current demand levels 
since the end of the third quarter  we have implemented across the board cost reduction activities that we estimate will yield approximately million in annual expense reductions 
our expense reductions associated with these actions are expected to range between million and million with million recognized in the fourth quarter of and the remainder to be recognized in the first quarter of the specific actions we took to achieve these cost reductions comprise headcount reductions of salaried and hourly employees  virtual elimination of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in executive and salaried pay  bonus and benefits and the introduction of shortened work weeks 
management determined that these actions  although difficult  were required to enable the company to adjust to current conditions and position us to respond quickly when the market recovers 
we have increased our focus on several new north american and international sales initiatives and supply chain cost reductions  as we rigorously pursue continued market share gains  margin improvement and profitability 
gross profit varies from period to period 
factors that affect gross profit include product mix  production levels and cost of raw materials 
margins tend to increase when production is skewed towards larger capacity cranes  special mission oriented vehicles  specialized carriers and heavy material transports

gross profit as a percent of revenues was for the year ended december  net revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable year period in revenue for was increased by approximately million by having a full year of noble product line revenues in and having three months of crane and schaeff revenues 
noble product line revenues increased approximately million while crane and schaeff contributed an additional million 
revenues would have decreased approximately million without the additional revenues generated by the noble product line  crane and schaeff 
the decrease is the result of a decrease in sales of forklifts and specialized carriers  which was partially offset by million increase in crane sales 
the increase in crane sales is attributed to an increase in chassis sales 
the company builds cranes on chassis supplied by the customer or by the company 
the increase in chassis sales is the result of a substantial sales increase to a particular distributor  who has elected to have the manitex subsidiary supply the chassis 
the majority of the decrease in forklift specialized carrier sales is due to decrease in the sales of military forklifts 
a decrease in the sale of commercial rough terrain forklifts  the result of the slowing north american economy  and a decrease in special carriers also contributed to the sales decline 
the decrease in military forklifts sales is attributed to the timing of governmental orders 
gross profit as a percent of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period  an erosion of 
the decrease in margin percent is due to a decrease in the gross margin percent for crane products which was offset by a modest increase in the gross margin for forklifts and specialized carriers 
the decrease in crane product margins was caused by a significant increase in the cost of raw materials and components 
although we experienced material price increases over the first half of the year  these were not nearly of the magnitude that we experienced starting late in the second quarter and into the third quarter 
through the second quarter of  increases in material prices were largely offset by increases in the sale of cranes with higher lifting capacity which have higher gross margins  the benefit of sourcing materials from lower cost countries  a price increase that was instituted in mid year and an improvement in 
table of contents production efficiencies 
it became clear during the third quarter of that these rapidly accelerating material price increases were going to continue and would adversely impact the company s margins 
in june   the company announced its annual price increases for all new orders received on or after july st 
the company continued to honor old prices on its existing backlog 
as such  the benefit from the price increase did not occur until late this year or will not occur until early next 
to further offset the effect of price increases  the company instituted a to surcharge on cranes shipped in the later part of the fourth quarter the forklift specialized carrier product line margin as percentage of net revenue increased modestly 
although the cost of materials for forklifts specialized carriers also increased  the effect was more than offset by a restructuring initiative that occurred early in the third quarter of  the elimination of start up of inefficiencies for the noble product line and the weakening of the canadian dollar  which positively impact margins on us dollar sales 
restructuring expenses during the third quarter of  the company began to restructure the manufacturing processes at its manitex liftking facility with the objective of improving production efficiencies and lowering our costs 
the company began to experience the benefits of the staffing reductions in the fourth quarter of an evaluation of the current staffing has been completed and as a result  the workforce was reduced by employees to align the size of our workforce to our current production requirements 
in connection with the reduction in force  the company was required to pay terminated employees million in severance  which has been included in operating expense and is shown in the income statement on a line entitled restructuring expenses 
beginning in september of  the united states and world financial markets came under unprecedented stress 
the immediate impact was a dramatic decrease in liquidity and credit availability throughout the world 
an incredibly rapid and significant deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe followed

since the end of the third quarter  we have implemented across the board cost reduction activities that we estimate will yield approximately million in annual expense reductions 
the specific actions taken to achieve these cost reductions comprise headcount reductions of salaried and hourly employees  virtual elimination of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in executive and salaried pay  bonus and benefits and the introduction of shortened workweeks 
these actions  although difficult  are required to enable the company to adjust to current conditions and position it to respond quickly when the market recovers 
certain of the aforementioned actions were implemented before december  significant additional steps were implemented shortly after year end 
restructuring expense severance payments related to actions taken before year end was approximately million 
additional  restructuring expense related to steps taken after december  will result in additional restructuring expense of approximately million being recorded during the first quarter of additionally  the company is focused on several new north american and international sales initiatives and supply chain cost reduction initiatives which are designed to continue market share gains  and to improve margins and profitability

table of contents in response to the impact of economic conditions and longer sales cycles  it was determined that swift management action was necessary to ensure that operating activity was balanced with current demand levels 
since the end of the third quarter  we have implemented across the board cost reduction activities that we estimate will yield approximately million in annual expense reductions 
the specific actions taken to achieve these cost reductions comprise headcount reductions of salaried and hourly employees  virtual elimination of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in executive and salaried pay  bonus and benefits and the introduction of shortened workweeks 
these actions  although difficult  are required to ensure the company adjusts to current conditions and is positioned to respond quickly when the market recovers 
certain of the aforementioned actions were implemented before december  significant additional steps were implemented shortly after year end 
restructuring expense severance payments related to actions taken before year end was approximately million 
additional  restructuring expense related to steps taken after december  will result in additional restructure expense being recorded during the first quarter of of approximately million 
additionally  the company is focused on several new north american and international sales initiatives and supply chain cost reduction initiatives which are designed to continued market share gains  to improve margins and profitability 
the company s ability to meet its commitments and contractual obligations is dependent on the company s ability to either negotiate extensions of its current credit agreements  replace the existing credit agreements with a new credit agreement with acceptable terms or to raise additional equity or debt financing 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in renegotiating its current credit facilities or consummating additional financing transactions 
the company needs cash to meet its working capital needs as the business grows  to acquire capital equipment  and to fund acquisitions and debt repayment 
we intend to use cash flows from operations and existing availability under the current revolving credit facilities to fund anticipated levels of operations for approximately the next months 
as outlined above  management has to ensure that operating activity is balanced with current demand levels and has reduced operating costs dramatically  and as a result management believes that its two credit facilities will provide sufficient working capital 
however  the length and severity of the current business contraction is not known  we cannot say with certainty that cash generated from operations will be adequate or that the credit facilities will have sufficient availability to bridge any short fall 
the longer the business contraction lasts or deeper it becomes the greater the risk 
we will likely need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings to support our growth strategy  which may include additional acquisitions 
there is no assurance that such financing will be available or  if available  on acceptable terms 
operating activities consumed million of cash for the year ended december   comprised of net earnings of million  non cash items totaling million offset by an increase in working capital of million 
the non cash items are principally composed of amortization and depreciation of million  non cash expense for stock based compensation of million offset by an increase in deferred tax assets of million 
the increase in working capital results primarily from an increase in accounts receivables of million  an increase in inventory of million  and a decrease in accrued expenses of million  and other changes that consumed million offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses of million  
table of contents the increase in receivables is attributed to a slowing of payments from our customer attributed to the distress in the financial markets 
in particular  several of our dealers were financed by ge capital  who had a moratorium on funding their existing customer credit lines from the beginning of december until early january 
approximately of increase in inventory is accounted for by an increase in finished goods 
the increase in finished goods inventory is primarily the result of the company having a greater number of finished boom trucks  sky cranes  rough terrain cranes and fuchs material handlers in inventory at december  the increase in cranes at end of is due to the contraction of business referred to above and an associated longer selling cycle 
the balance of the increase in inventory is due to an increase in raw materials 
the company had open purchase commitment  when the sudden business contraction occurred at the end of the third quarter 
purchases were cancelled or receipts were delayed when possible  but this was not always possible 
the decrease in accrued expenses is due to changes in a number of items  the most significant were a decrease in accrued bonuses of million and a decrease of million in accrued warranty 
the decrease in accrued bonuses is the result of bonuses being lower in the decrease in accrued warranty is related to our increased efforts to improve initial quality and an increased emphasis on charging back warranty claims to our vendors 
the increase in accounts payable is due to increased purchases and a slowing of payment to vendors 
the decrease in prepaid expense is related to a decrease in deposit made on future inventory purchases 
investing activities consumed million of cash 
the company used million to purchase crane and schaeff and invested an additional million for capital equipment offset by proceeds on sale of fixed assets of million 
capital expenditures include a consolidation financial system and a crane  which was purchased to rent

new borrowings were comprised of an increase of million on our lines of credit  million in notes to finance insurance premiums  and million borrowed under a floorplan financing agreement  used to finance cranes purchased by crane 
payments of approximately million  million  million  and million were made to reduce the liftking industries note  a bank note payable  notes to finance insurance and capital leases  respectively 
operating activities generated cash of million for the year ended december   comprised of net earnings of million  non cash items totaling million offset by an increase in working capital of million 
the non cash items are principally composed of amortization and depreciation of million  an increase in inventory reserves of million  an increase of million in a reserve for uncertain tax positions  and a million non cash expense for stock based compensation 
the increase in working capital results primarily from an increase in accounts receivables of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million offset by a decrease in inventory of million and an increase in accrued expense of million 
the increase in receivables is attributed to an increase in sales 
sales of for the quarter ended december  were million higher than the million reported for the quarter ended december  the decrease in accounts payable correlates with the decrease in inventory 
a faster payment cycle for accounts payable was a secondary factor which contributed to the decrease in accounts payable 
most of the decrease in inventory occurred in manitex liftking facility  located in woodbridge  ontario 
manitex liftking at december  had purchased inventory and incurred labor and overhead costs for several large long term specialized lifting equipment projects that had a longer manufacturing cycle 
inventory decreased in  when the projects were completed and the items were shipped 
the increase in accrued expense is primarily related to increases of million  million and million in accrued bonuses  vacation and warranty  respectively 
investing activities generated cash of million 
the sale of discontinued operations generated million of cash 
the company spent million to purchase equipment 
the purchase of a semi automatic multi head welder is the only significant piece of equipment purchased in

the exercise of warrants that were outstanding at december  provided another million 
the proceeds generated by the sale of stock  the exercise of warrants  the sales of discontinued operations and cash provided by operations was used to make principal payments of million against notes payable 
as a result of these principal payments  the note payable balance  including the current portion  decrease from million at december  to million at december  an additional million was used to reduce capital lease obligations 
contingencies the company is involved in various legal proceedings  including product liability and workers compensation matters which have arisen in the normal course of operations 
certain cases are at a preliminary stage  and it is not possible to estimate the amount or timing of any cost to the company 
however  the company does not believe that these contingencies  in aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following is a schedule as of december  of our long term contractual commitments  future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements and other long term obligations 
payments due by period total thereafter revolving credit facilities term loan operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include commitments of approximately relating to inventory items 
the balance is attributable to non inventory items  including fixed assets  research and development materials  supplies and services at december   the company had unrecognized tax benefits of for which the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective tax authority 
thus  these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical 
table of contents experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
for products shipped fob destination  sales are recognized when the product reaches its fob destination  or when the services are rendered  which represents the point when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer 
for products shipped fob shipping point  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped  as this is the point when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers 
customers may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
revenue is recognized in such cases only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the units  the units have been completed  tested and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has authorized in writing that we hold the units for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the units are invoiced under our customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership pass to the customer upon invoicing  the units are segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and we have no further obligations under the order 
the company establishes reserve for future warranty expense at the point when revenue is recognized by the company and is based on percentage of revenues 
the provision for estimated warranty claims  which is included in cost of sales  is based on sales 
foreign currency translation and transactions 
the financial statements of the company s non us subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted average exchange rate for the year for income and expense items 
resulting translation adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income oci as a component of stockholders equity 
the company converts receivables and payables denominated in other than the company s functional currency at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date 
the resulting transaction exchange gains or losses  except for certain transactions gains or loss related to intercompany receivable and payables  are included in other income and expense 
transaction gains and losses related to intercompany receivables and payables not anticipated to be settled in the foreseeable future are excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded as a translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income oci as a component of stockholders equity 
forward currency exchange contracts 
beginning in september  the company entered in forward currency exchange contracts in relationship such that the exchange gains and losses on the assets and liabilities denominated in other than the reporting units functional currency would be offset by the changes in the market value of the forward currency exchange contracts it holds 
in accordance with fas no 
 the company records at the balance sheet date the forward currency exchange contracts at its market value with any associated gain or loss being recorded in current earnings as a currency gain or loss 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the company s estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
inventories and related reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated reserve is based upon specific identification of excess or obsolete inventories 

table of contents warrants 
the company has issued warrants  which allow the warrant holder to purchase one share of stock at specified price for a specific period of time 
the company records equity instruments including warrants issued to non employees based on the fair value at date of issue 
the fair value of the warrants at date of issuance is estimated using the black scholes model 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company accounts for other intangible assets under the guidance of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
indefinite and definite lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing 
the company capitalizes certain costs related to patent technology 
additionally  a substantial portion of the purchase price related to the company s acquisitions has been assigned to patents or unpatented technology  trade name  customer backlog  and customer relationships 
the intangibles acquired in acquisitions have been valued using a discounted flow approach 
intangibles  except goodwill  are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company reviews its long lived assets  including property and equipment  and other identifiable intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows  without interest charges  will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
impairment is measured at fair value 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment using a business valuation method  which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free  after tax projected future cash flows  discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
the determination of fair value requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  revenue growth and operating earnings projections  discount rates  terminal growth rates  and required capital expenditure projections 
during the fourth quarter of  our stock price declined significantly and we began to see signs of a slowdown in our lifting equipment segment  highlighted by a decrease in our backlog 
additionally  access to the credit markets  which are critical to the ability of some of our customers to finance crane purchases  has been restricted 
since our impairment testing as of september  had not yet been finalized  we reevaluated our assumptions for the facts known as of december  and adjusted our projections accordingly 
we believe the changes in the circumstance that occurred during the fourth quarter of  could be indicators of potential impairment under the guidance of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
because our projections were revised to take into account the facts known at december   we concluded that it was not necessary re perform impairment testing at december  since the projections employed to re perform the impairment testing would be the same as those used in the earlier testing  the result would be materially the same 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the market approach was also considered in evaluating the potential for impairment by calculating fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable  publicly traded companies 
this analysis also did not indicate impairment 
moreover  we also observed implied ebitda multiples from relatively recent merger and acquisition activity in the industry  which was used to test the reasonableness of the results 

table of contents during much of the fourth quarter and as of december   our market capitalization was below book value 
while the market capitalization decline was considered in our evaluation of fair value  the market metric is only one indicator of fair value 
it is has been our opinion that the market capitalization approach is simply not a reliable indicator of the value for the company  either now or in the past 
our conclusion is based on the fact that trading volume on our stock is very limited  the company does not provide guidance nor is there is any significant analyst coverage 
furthermore  very modest sized trades can impact the stock price significantly because our trading volume is so low 
we will continue to monitor market conditions and determine if any additional interim review of goodwill is warranted 
further deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with our projections may ultimately result in a future impairment 
in the event we determine that goodwill is impaired in the future  we would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations 
the company has recorded  loss on impairment of long lived assets during no impairment charges were recorded in and see note for detail regarding the impairment charge research and development expenses 
the company expenses research and development costs as incurred 
for the periods ended december    and expenses were million  million  and million  respectively 
warranty expense 
the company establishes reserve for future warranty expense at point when revenue is recognized by the company and is based on percentage of revenues 
the provision for estimated warranty claims  which is included in cost of sales  is based on sales 
litigation claims 
in determining whether liabilities should be recorded for pending litigation claims  the company must assess the allegations and the likelihood that it will successfully defend itself 
when the company believes it is probable that it will not prevail in a particular matter  it will then make an estimate of the amount of liability based  in part  on the advice of outside legal counsel 
deferred income taxes 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in our most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years as cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
at december   and  we provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets based on our cumulative losses in recent years  except for certain state tax credits computation of earnings per share 
basic earnings per share eps was computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
the number of shares related to options  warrants  restricted stock and similar instruments included in diluted eps eps is based on the treasury stock method prescribed in sfas no 
this method assumes theoretical repurchase of shares using proceeds of the respective stock option or warrant exercised  and for restricted stock the amount of compensation cost attributed to future services which has not yet been recognized and the amount of current and deferred tax benefit  if any  that would be credited to additional paid in capital upon the vesting of the restricted stock at a price equal to the issuer s average stock price during the related earnings period 
accordingly  the number of shares includable in the calculation of eps in respect of the stock options  warrants  restricted stock and similar instruments is dependent on this average stock price and will increase as the average stock price increases 

table of contents securities of a subsidiary that were convertible into its parent company s common stock were considered among potential common shares of the parent company for the purposes of computing consolidated diluted eps until conversion occurred 
including the contingently convertible debt and warrants in the diluted eps calculation is anti dilutive when there is a loss and is  therefore  excluded from the diluted per share calculation under paragraph of sfas the effect of applying paragraph of sfas was to exclude  shares from the diluted eps calculation of the years ended december  stock based compensation 
in accordance with sfas no 
r share based payments share based payments to employees  including grants of restricted stock units  are measured at fair value as of the date of grant and are expensed in the consolidated statement of operations over the service period generally the vesting period new accounting pronouncements see note regarding the company s adoption as of january   of fasb interpretation no
