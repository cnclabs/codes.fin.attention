in response to these challenges  we increased marketing and promotional expenditures to attract and retain guests

table of contents below 
we anticipate that downward pressure on profits will persist as long as we continue to experience the adverse effects of the negative macroeconomic environment  the aggressive marketing programs of our competitors and the legal defense costs associated with the kerzner lawsuit

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our policies  including the estimated lives assigned to 
table of contents our assets  the determination of bad debt reserves  self insurance reserves  concentration of credit risk  and the calculation of income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observations of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
to provide an understanding of the methodologies applied  our significant accounting policies are discussed where appropriate in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of monarch and golden road 
intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated 
self insurance reserves the company reviews self insurance reserves at least quarterly 
the reserve is determined by reviewing the actual expenditures for the previous twelve month period and reports prepared by the third party plan administrator for any significant unpaid claims 
the reserve is an amount estimated to pay both reported and unreported claims as of the balance sheet date  which management believes are adequate 
casino revenues casino revenues represent the net win from gaming activity  which is the difference between wins and losses 
additionally  net win is reduced by a provision for anticipated payouts on slot participation fees  progressive jackpots and any pre arranged marker discounts 
promotional allowances the retail value of hotel  food and beverage services provided to customers without charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances 
income taxes income taxes are recorded in accordance with the liability method specified by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes  the following basic principles are applied in accounting for income taxes at the date of the financial statements a a current liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on taxes for the current year  b a deferred income tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  c the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on the provisions of the enacted tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated  and d the measurement of deferred income taxes is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based upon available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
the company also applies the requirements of fin which prescribes minimum recognition thresholds a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
implementation has resulted in no material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations
