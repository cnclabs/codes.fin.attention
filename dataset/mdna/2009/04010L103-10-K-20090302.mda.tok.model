overview we are a specialty finance company that is a closed end  non diversified management investment company incorporated in maryland 
we have elected to be regulated as a bdc under the investment company act 
we were founded on april  and were initially funded on june  and on october  completed our initial public offering the ipo 
our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments 
we invest primarily in first and second lien senior loans and mezzanine debt  which in some cases includes an equity component like warrants 
to a lesser extent we make equity investments 
we are externally managed by ares capital management  an affiliate of ares management  an independent international investment management firm  pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement 
ares administration  an affiliate of ares management  provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate 
as a bdc  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities and indebtedness of private us companies  cash  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
the company has elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to rics 
to qualify as a ric  we must  among other things  meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to our stockholders at least of our investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  for each year 
pursuant to this election  we generally will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders 
critical accounting policies basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications which  in the opinion of management  are necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the operations and financial condition as of and for the periods presented 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include short term  liquid investments in a money market fund 
cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair value 
concentration of credit risk the company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions and  at times  cash held in money market accounts may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insured limit 
investments investment transactions are recorded on the trade date 
realized gains or losses are computed using the specific identification method 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations 
in order to validate market quotations  we look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value  including the source and nature of the quotations 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available ie  substantially all of our investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors  based on the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing month period and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
the valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter  with approximately based on value of our valuations of portfolio companies without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm 
as part of the valuation process  we may take into account the following types of factors  if relevant  in determining the fair value of our investments the enterprise value of a portfolio company an estimate of the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to publicly traded securities  changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future and other relevant factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation 
because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors  based on the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period 
additionally  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize 
further  such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities 
if we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale  we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
see risk factors risks relating to our investments price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the fair value of our portfolio investments  reducing our net asset value through increased net unrealized depreciation 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with our portfolio management team 
preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed by our management 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations  as well as the input of independent valuation firms with respect to the valuations of approximately based on value of our portfolio companies without readily available market quotations 
the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which expands the application of fair value accounting for investments see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income recognition interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  is recorded on an accrual basis 
discounts and premiums on securities purchased are accreted amortized over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method 
the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected 
accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and  in management s judgment  are likely to remain current 
the company may make exceptions to this if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection 
payment in kind interest the company has loans in its portfolio that contain a payment in kind pik provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain the company s status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends even though the company has not yet collected the cash 
capital structuring service fees and other income the company s investment adviser seeks to provide assistance to our portfolio companies in connection with the company s investments and in return the company may receive fees for capital structuring services 
these fees are normally paid at the closing of the investments  are generally non recurring and are recognized as revenue when earned upon closing of the investment 
the services that the company s investment adviser provides vary by investment  but generally consist of reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from multiple equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  and providing general financial advice  which concludes upon closing of the investment 
any services of the above nature subsequent to the closing would generally generate a separate fee payable to the company 
in certain instances where the company is invited to participate as a co lender in a transaction and does not provide significant services in connection with the investment  a portion of loan fees paid to the company in such situations will be deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
the company s investment adviser may also take a seat on the board of directors of a portfolio company  or observe the meetings of the board of directors without taking a formal seat 
other income includes fees for asset management  consulting  loan guarantees  commitments  and other services rendered by the company to portfolio companies 
such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered 
foreign currency translation the company s books and records are maintained in us dollars 
any foreign currency amounts are translated into us dollars on the following basis market value of investment securities  other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the period 
purchases and sales of investment securities  income and expenses at the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions  income or expenses 
results of operations based on changes in foreign exchange rates are separately disclosed in the statement of operations 
foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in us companies and us government securities 
these risks include  but are not limited to  currency fluctuation and revaluations and future adverse political  social and economic developments  which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable us companies or us government securities 
accounting for derivative instruments the company does not utilize hedge accounting and marks its derivatives to market through operations 
offering expenses the company s offering costs are charged against the proceeds from equity offerings when received 
debt issuance costs debt issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the related credit facility using the straight line method  which closely approximates the effective yield method 
us federal income taxes the company has elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to rics 
in order to qualify as a ric  among other things  the company is required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  for each year 
the company has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders  which will generally relieve the company from us federal income taxes 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income  as required 
to the extent that the company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions  the company accrues excise tax  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned 
certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries are subject to us federal and state income taxes 
dividends dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date 
the amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the current and expected future earnings estimated by management 
net realized capital gains  if any  are generally distributed at least annually  although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions we declare in cash on behalf of our stockholders  unless a stockholder elects to receive cash 
as a result  if our board of directors authorizes  and we declare  a cash dividend  then our stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  rather than receiving the cash dividend 
while we generally use primarily newly issued shares to implement the plan especially if our shares are trading at a premium to net asset value  we may purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the plan 
in particular  if our shares are trading at a significant enough discount to net asset value and we are otherwise permitted under applicable law to purchase such shares  we intend to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under our dividend reinvestment plan 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of actual and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income or loss and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include the valuation of investments 
new accounting pronouncements on october   fasb staff position no 
determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  or fsp  was issued 
fsp provides an illustrative example of how to determine the fair value of a financial asset in an inactive market 
fsp does not change the fair value measurement principles set forth in sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of sfas 
since adopting sfas in january  our process for determining the fair value of our investments has been  and continues to be  consistent with the guidance provided in the example in fsp as a result  the adoption of fsp did not affect our process for determining the fair value of our investments and did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

when we refer to the weighted average yield at fair value in this report  we compute it with respect to particular securities by taking the a annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount earned on accruing debt included in such securities  and dividing it by b total debt and income producing securities at fair value included in such securities

the investment adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments 
in addition to various risk management and monitoring tools  the investment adviser grades the credit status of all investments on a scale of to no less frequently than quarterly 
this system is intended to reflect the performance of the portfolio company s business  the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors 
under this system  investments with a grade of involve the least amount of risk in our portfolio 
this portfolio company is performing above expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable  including a potential exit 
investments graded involve a level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination 
this portfolio company is performing as expected and the risk factors are neutral to favorable 
all new investments are initially assessed a grade of investments graded involve a portfolio company performing below expectations and indicates that the investment s risk has increased materially since origination 
this portfolio company may be out of compliance with debt covenants  however  payments are generally not more than days past due 
for investments graded  our investment adviser increases procedures to monitor the portfolio company and will write down the fair value of the investment if it is deemed to be impaired 
an investment grade of indicates that the portfolio company is performing materially below expectations and that the investment risk has substantially increased since origination 
most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent 
investments graded are not anticipated to be repaid in full and our investment adviser will reduce the fair market value of the investment to the amount our investment adviser anticipates will be recovered 
our investment adviser employs half point increments to reflect underlying trends in portfolio company operating or financial performance  as well as the general outlook

as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in total indebtedness outstanding 
subject to leverage restrictions  the company had approximately million available for additional borrowings under the facilities as of december  due to increasing volatility in global markets  the availability of capital and access to capital markets has been limited 
until constraints on raising new capital ease  we intend to pursue other avenues of liquidity such as adjusting the pace of our investments  becoming more selective in evaluating investment opportunities to ensure appropriate risk adjusted returns  pursuing asset sales  and or recycling lower yielding investments 
as the global liquidity situation evolves  we will continue to monitor and adjust our funding approach accordingly 
however  given the unprecedented nature of the volatility in the global markets  there can be no assurances that these activities will be successful 
moreover  if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  we could face materially higher financing costs 
consequently  our operating strategy could be materially and adversely affected 
the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if required 
as a result  we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments 
a failure to renew or replace the cp funding facility with other indebtedness  and any required sale of all or portion of the collateral securing the cp funding facility  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations

portfolio valuation investment transactions are recorded on the trade date 
realized gains or losses are computed using the specific identification method 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations 
in order to validate market quotations  we look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value  including the source and nature of the quotations 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available ie  substantially all of our investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors  based on the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing month period and under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
the valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter  with approximately based on value of our valuations of portfolio companies without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm 
as part of the valuation process  we may take into account the following types of factors  if relevant  in determining the fair value of our investments the enterprise value of a portfolio company an estimate of the total fair value of the portfolio company s debt and equity  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  a comparison of the portfolio company s securities to publicly traded securities  changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future and other relevant factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation 
because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors  based on the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period 
additionally  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize 
further  such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities 
if we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale  we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it 
in addition  changes in the market environment  such as inflation  and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
see risk factors risks relating to our investments price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the fair value of our portfolio investments  reducing our net asset value through increased net unrealized depreciation 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with our portfolio management team 
preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed by our management 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations  as well as the input of independent valuation firms with respect to the valuations of approximately based on value of our portfolio companies without readily available market quotations 
the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio without a readily available market quotation in good faith based on the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates of our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates 
because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings  our net investment income is affected by the spread between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
as of december   approximately of the investments at fair value in our portfolio were at fixed rates while approximately were at variable rates and were non interest earning 
the debt securitization  the cp funding facility and the revolving credit facility all feature variable rates 
we regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk 
we assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities 
based on that review  we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates 
in october  we entered into a two year interest rate swap agreement for a total notional amount of million 
under the interest rate swap agreement  we will pay a fixed interest rate of and receive a floating rate based on the prevailing three month libor 
we believe that this agreement will enable us to mitigate interest rate risk and remain match funded 
while hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future  such as interest rate swap agreements  may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments
