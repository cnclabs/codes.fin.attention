recent developments the fdic is investigating the bank to determine whether the bank overcharged certain borrowers in   and in violation of the federal equal opportunity act and the federal fair housing act and whether its marketing and disclosure materials used in and with respect to certain loans were misleading in violation of federal trade practices laws 
in connection with this investigation  
table of contents we anticipate that the fdic will require the bank to pay restitution to impacted borrowers and pay a civil money penalty 
we have set aside million for restitution and the penalty although no assurance can be given that this amount will ultimately prove to be the final amount we are required to pay 
we expect this matter will be finalized during further information is provided in item a of part i of this report under the heading the fdic will likely require the bank to pay restitution and a penalty during and to implement and enhance certain controls and in item of part i of this report 
on february   the fdic announced a proposed rule outlining its plan to implement an emergency special assessment of basis points on all insured depository institutions in order to restore the dif to an acceptable level 
the assessment  which would be payable on september   would be in addition to a planned increase in premiums and a change in the way regular premiums are assessed which the fdic also approved on february  in addition  the proposed rule provides that  after june   if the reserve ratio of the dif is estimated to fall to a level that that the fdic believes would adversely affect public confidence or to a level which is close to or less than zero at the end of a calendar quarter  then an additional emergency special assessment of up to basis points may be imposed on all insured depository institutions 
if this rule is adopted as proposed  it will significantly increase the bank s fdic premiums in pursuant to eesa  which was signed into law on october   the us department of treasury us treasury has the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities  and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the u 
s treasury announced the troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program cpp 
the cpp made an initial amount of billion of capital available to us financial institutions from the billion authorized by eesa in the form of preferred stock investments by the us treasury 
on january   an additional billion of funds were released to the treasury for availability to financial institutions under the cpp 
the terms of the cpp differ depending on whether the participating institution is publicly traded 
for institutions like first mariner that are publicly traded  the general terms of the cpp are as follows the participating institution will issue preferred stock to the us treasury treasury preferred stock that pays a quarterly cumulative preferred dividend of per annum on the liquidation amount of the stock for the first five years  and then per annum thereafter  the us treasury will receive a warrant entitling it to buy shares of the participating institution s common stock equivalent in value to of the treasury preferred stock  the treasury preferred stock may not be redeemed for a period of three years  except with proceeds from high quality private capital  the consent of the us treasury is required to increase cash dividends on common stock or any stock repurchases  with limited exceptions  during the first three years  unless the treasury preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred to third parties  and participating institutions must adopt the us treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the us treasury holds the equity issued under the tarp 
on february   president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act of the recovery act into law 
among other things  the recovery act imposes additional executive compensation restrictions on institutions that participate in the cpp for so long as any tarp assistance remains outstanding 
among these restrictions is a prohibition against making most severance payments to senior executive officers  which term includes the principal executive officer  the principal accounting officer  and  generally  the three next most highly compensated executive officers 
table of contents of the institution  and to the next five most highly compensated employees 
the restrictions also limit the type  timing and amount of bonuses  retention awards and incentive compensation that may be paid to the institution s five most highly compensated employees 
although first mariner has applied with the us treasury to participate in the cpp  it has not yet done so 
if first mariner does participate  certain of our executive officers and employees would be subject to the foregoing compensation restrictions and first mariner would be obligated to make quarterly dividend payments on its outstanding treasury preferred securities 
the terms of the treasury preferred stock provide that the holders thereof are entitled to elect two directors to an institution s board of directors if it fails to make six quarterly dividend payments on the treasury preferred stock 
as noted elsewhere in this report  first mariner elected in december to defer payments of interest under its junior subordinated debentures issued to the trusts 
the terms of the debentures prohibit first mariner from paying dividends on any equity securities  which would include the treasury preferred stock 
accordingly  if first mariner participates in the cpp  it might choose  assuming its regulators consented  to resume interest payments under its debentures 
as discussed above  the fdic recently announced the tlgp that provides unlimited deposit insurance on funds in noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts not otherwise covered by the existing deposit insurance limit of  as well as a guarantee of the newly issued senior debt of all fdic insured institutions and their holding companies 
all eligible institutions were covered under the program for the first days without incurring any costs 
after the initial period  participating institutions will be assessed a charge of basis points per annum for the additional insured deposits and a charge of basis points per annum for guaranteed senior unsecured debt 
we have elected to participate in the tlgp  and we anticipate that our regulatory costs will increase as a result 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the consolidated financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
when applying accounting policies in such areas that are subjective in nature  management must use its best judgment to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of underlying collateral  and the timing of loan charge offs 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
estimates 
table of contents for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio 
current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  the views of bank regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  and peer comparisons are also factors 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction and change in the interest rate environment  which may impact a borrower s ability to pay  legislation impacting the banking industry  and environmental and economic conditions specific to the bank s service areas 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  results may differ from our estimates 
securities available for sale securities available for sale are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate a permanent decline in value 
rather  it means that the prospects for near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the security 
the initial indication of otti for both debt and equity securities is a decline in the market value below the amount recorded for an investment  and the severity and duration of the decline 
in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost  recent events specific to the issuer  including investment downgrades by rating agencies and economic conditions of its industry  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery 
for marketable equity securities  we also consider the issuer s financial condition  capital strength  and near term prospects 
for debt securities and for perpetual preferred securities that are treated as debt securities for the purpose of other than temporary analysis  we also consider the cause of the price decline general level of interest rates and industry and issuer specific factors  the issuer s financial condition  near term prospects and current ability to make future payments in a timely manner  the issuer s ability to service debt  and any change in agencies ratings at evaluation date from acquisition date and any likely imminent action 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
deferred income taxes under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
loan income recognition interest income on loans is accrued at the contractual rate based on the principal outstanding 
loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over the contractual loan terms 
accrual of interest is discontinued when its receipt is in doubt  which typically occurs when a loan becomes impaired 
any interest accrued to income in the year when interest accruals are discontinued is generally reversed 
management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when a loan is in the process of collection and the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to satisfy the principal balance and accrued interest 
loans are returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectibility has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to pay and remain current 
payments on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal 

table of contents loan repurchases our sales agreements with investors who buy our loans generally contain covenants which may require us to repurchase loans under certain provisions  including delinquencies  or return premiums paid by those investors should the loan be paid off early 
these covenants are usual and customary within the mortgage banking industry 
we maintain a reserve included in other liabilities for potential losses relating to these sales covenants 
loans repurchased are accounted for under american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
under the sop  loans repurchased must be recorded at market value at the time of repurchase with any deficiency for recording the loan compared to proceeds paid charged to earnings 
repurchased loans are carried on the balance sheet in the loan portfolio 
any further change in the underlying risk profile or further impairment is recorded as a specific reserve in the allowance for loan losses through the provision for loan losses 
repurchased loans which are foreclosed upon are transferred to real estate acquired through foreclosure at the time of ratification of foreclosure and recorded at estimated fair value 
these assets remain in real estate acquired through foreclosure until their disposition 
any declines in value subsequent to foreclosure reduce the carrying amounts through a charge to noninterest expense 
real estate acquired through foreclosure we record foreclosed real estate assets at the lower of cost or estimated fair value on their acquisition dates and at the lower of such initial amount or estimated fair value less estimated selling costs thereafter 
estimated fair value is based upon many subjective factors  including location and condition of the property and current economic conditions  among other things 
because the calculation of fair value relies on estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  results may differ from our estimates 
write downs at time of transfer are made through the allowance for loan losses 
write downs subsequent to transfer are included in our noninterest expenses  along with operating income  net of related expenses of such properties and gains or losses realized upon disposition 
results of operations and financial condition the following discussion compares our financial condition at december  to the financial condition at december  and results of operations for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and related notes as well as statistical information included elsewhere in this report 
performance overview we recorded a net loss of million for compared to net loss of million for  with diluted losses per share totaling for compared to diluted losses per share of in the decrease in net income and earnings per share was a result of decreased gross revenue net interest income and noninterest income of million or  increased noninterest expenses of million or  and an increased provision for loan losses of million or 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to million in our results for were significantly impacted by persistent negative trends in the residential real estate markets  which began in the latter portion of and worsened considerably in and during  we continued to address issues with previously repurchased and transferred high loan to value ratio low documentation alt a loans and experienced increased negative trends in 
table of contents residential construction and development loans 
the alt a loans were primarily originated in and through our wholesale division and were repurchased due to delinquent payments by the borrower within the first days of the loans term 
during the first half of  the company repurchased the majority of the anticipated buybacks and progressed through the collection process 
as declines in real estate values have continued  the company provided for additional reserves throughout and for the anticipated loss exposure 
our results for and included and million  respectively  in pretax losses relating to its exposure to alt a residential loans originated by its wholesale division 
these charges included million and million in and  respectively  for the write down of foreclosed assets awaiting sales or assets sold at a loss  million in for initial write downs on loans placed into the company s loan portfolio during the year  and million and million in and  respectively  in additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses related to these loans 
in addition to these losses  earnings were further impacted by the loss of interest income on loans placed on nonaccrual status  the cost of carrying foreclosed properties  and higher legal and collection expenses relating to these loans 
as of december   the company had a total million in real estate acquired through foreclosure that were originated as alt a loans awaiting sale  with the vast majority being single family residential properties located in northern virginia 
additionally  we have million of alt a nonperforming loans in our loan portfolio with specific reserves totaling million 
management discontinued its offering of alt a loans through its wholesale lending division at the end of  and believes its exposure to and resolution of its repurchase provisions for these products is substantially complete 
originations of loans through our retail delivery channel performed well and we experienced minimal repurchase and credit losses from retail originated loans 
the company closed its wholesale lending operation entirely in july of there were no loan repurchases during for early payment default 
our largest category of revenue  net interest income  increased million or due to higher levels of average earning assets  coupled with lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
noninterest income decreased million or due primarily to otti charges recorded on certain investment securities  partially offset by gains on retail banking branch sales two branches and increases in mortgage banking revenue 
our increase in total expenses resulted primarily due to increased expenses for salaries  occupancy  and expenses related to real estate acquired through foreclosure 
the increase of million in the provision for loan losses reflects needed increases in the allowance for loan losses relating to weaknesses in the residential construction and development loan portfolio and to maintain reserve levels and replenish charge offs of alt a mortgage and residential construction and development loans 
the provision for loan losses recorded resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to of total loans as of december  from as of december  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to million in due to the significant pretax loss and the recording of  in state tax credits during the return on average assets was for compared to for the return on average equity for was compared to for average equity to average assets was for compared to for the decrease in both the return on average assets and the return on average equity was the result of the higher net loss in our total assets increased by million or during  reflecting strong loan origination volume 
earning assets increased million or from billion in to billion in deposits increased by million to million at december  from million at december  stockholders equity decreased million or  reflecting the loss  a decrease in other comprehensive income due to the decrease in the market value of securities classified as available for sale and interest rate swaps  and shares repurchased under 
table of contents our stock repurchase plan 
these items were offset somewhat by shares sold and issued upon the exercise of options and in connection with our employee stock purchase plan 
as a result of weakened residential real estate conditions  our asset quality deteriorated substantially due to weakened markets for residential real estate  which impacted all of our asset quality measures 
we increased our allowance for loan losses to million  which totaled of nonperforming assets as of december   compared to as of december   as our level of nonperforming assets to total assets increased to at december  from at december  our level of loans days delinquent and still accruing interest increased to million from million in our ratio of net chargeoffs to average total loans was in compared to in capital adequacy levels as defined by banking regulation declined from the level of well capitalized at december  to adequately capitalized at december  the ratios as of december  for our capital leverage  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets were   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  at december  our regulatory capital levels decreased due to the decline in stockholders equity and disallowance of a portion of our deferred tax assets for regulatory capital ratios 
the bank s similar capital ratios as of december  were   and  respectively  which also exceeded levels for adequately capitalized 
as a result of falling below well capitalized levels  the bank may not place brokered certificates of deposits without the granting of a waiver from its regulators 
results of operations net interest income margins our primary source of earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest expense we pay on interest bearing sources of funds  such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income we earn is determined mostly by the average balances volume and the rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our funding sources 
net interest income for increased by million to million compared to million for  primarily due to higher levels of earning assets  decreased rates on interest bearing liabilities  and an increase in the net interest margin 
the yield on average earning assets decreased from for to for and the rates on average interest bearing liabilities decreased from for to for rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities decreased due to decreased market interest rates 
rates on average earning assets were also negatively impacted by higher levels of nonperforming assets during compared to average earning assets increased from the level of billion to billion for  while average interest bearing liabilities increased from the level of million to billion for the net interest margin is the key performance measure for our net interest income 
our net interest margin is affected by our loan pricing  our mix of earning assets  levels of nonperforming assets  and our distribution and pricing of deposits and borrowings 
our net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets increased to for  as compared to for the comparable period in  as the rates of interest bearing sources of funds decreased more than the increases in average earning assets 
interest income total interest income decreased by million mostly due to the decreased yield on average earning assets 
yields on earning assets for the period decreased to from due to the 
table of contents depressed rate environment in the yield on total loans decreased from to due to the decrease in market rates and a higher level of nonperforming assets 
the yield on interest bearing deposits decreased from for to for the drop in the interest bearing deposit yield was primarily due to a significant drop in the federal funds and other market rates over the past twelve months 
average loans outstanding increased by million  with increases in commercial loans and lines of credit million  commercial mortgages million  residential mortgages million  and consumer loans million  partially offset by decreases in consumer residential construction loans million and commercial construction loans million 
the decrease in both commercial and consumer residential construction loans is due primarily to the deterioration of the real estate market  which has led to the reduction of new construction 
in addition  we had several large construction loans that converted to permanent residential mortgage loans during the year 
the increases in commercial loans and lines of credit and in commercial mortgages are due to a continued focus on commercial lending 
the increase in residential mortgage loans is due primarily to increased portfolio lending and the conversion of previous construction loans to permanent residential mortgage financing 
consumer loans increased due to increases in both bank and mariner finance consumer lending 
average loans held for sale decreased million  primarily due to faster execution of loans sales to investors in average securities decreased by million  due primarily to normal principal repayments on mortgage backed securities and million in sales of securities  partially offset by purchases of securities of million 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million  due to a decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  from for to for  which was partially offset by a higher level of interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing deposits from in to in was driven primarily by decreases in the rates on money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
average interest bearing deposits increased by million primarily due to an increase in the volume of time deposits  mostly brokered deposits that we placed during an increase in average borrowings of million was due primarily to increased borrowings on mariner finance s consumer finance line of credit to fund its consumer loan growth and additional short term fhlb borrowings by the bank 
we experienced a decrease in the costs of borrowed funds from for to for due to the decline in variable rate trust preferred security costs and lower short term borrowing rates

noninterest income we derive noninterest income principally from mortgage banking activities  service fees on our deposit accounts  atm fees  commissions on sales of nondeposit investment products brokerage fees  commissions we earn on sales of insurance products  and income from boli 
our noninterest income for the year ended december  totaled million  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  due primarily to otti charges recorded on certain investment securities  partially offset by an increase in total mortgage 
table of contents banking revenue  including gains on sales of mortgage loans  the gains on the sales of former branches  and an increase in insurance sales commissions 
mortgage banking revenue increased from million for to million for due to a larger volume of originations of loans  higher margins on loans sold  as well as increased values derived from rate lock commitments on loans in the mortgage loan pipeline 
the volume of loans sold increased from million in to billion in the volume of loans we have originated has shifted from wholesale originations to retail and reverse mortgage production 
deposit service charges declined to million in from million for due to lower overdraft income and to a decline in the number of accounts in general 
insurance sales commissions increased  due to increased insurance product sales from mariner finance 
we recognized an  net trading loss during  compared to a net trading loss of  for the same period in  mainly due to declines in value of borrowings accounted for at fair value 
these losses were partially offset by improved market values of trading assets of  brokerage fees decreased  during  as we realized lower mutual fund and annuity sales 
we recognized  in gains on sales of securities in  compared to  during during  we also recognized million in otti charges on three of our securities available for sale

we recognized  in net gains on the sales of our former towson and ocean city retail banking branches during these branches were sold as part of our ongoing practice of reviewing branch and market performance

expenses for the bank  including mortgage operations  declined million  while mariner finance s expenses increased million 

table of contents secondary marketing valuation expense decreased million for  and write downs and costs of real estate acquired through foreclosure increased million  as nonperforming alt a loans moved through the foreclosure process 
the net decrease in these line items combined is reflective of the decrease in our total alt a loan exposure and the shift in cost to resolving the assets from setting up initial repurchase valuations 
we believe we have substantially reached the end of our exposure to repurchasing alt a loans and our remaining losses will depend to a large degree on future residential real estate values 
our salary and employee benefits expenses increased million  or  due to increased staffing levels related to branch expansion of consumer finance operations 
occupancy expenses and furniture  fixtures  and equipment expenses also increased by million and  respectively  for the year ended december  due to the consumer finance operations expansion and increases in lease rates at bank facilities

we will realize the benefits of the incentives in our reported earnings as the credits can be utilized  in accordance with accounting standards that govern the recognition of investment tax credits

the maturity structure of our investment portfolio is significantly influenced by the level of prepayment activity on mortgage backed investments 
at december   the average duration of our investment portfolio was years  longer than the average duration of years at december   primarily due to the increase in the projected lives of mortgage backed securities and a higher mix of long term trust preferred securities

quarterly  we review each security in our afs portfolio to determine the nature of any decline in value and evaluate if any impairment should be classified as otti 
the trust preferred securities we hold in our securities portfolio were issued by other banks and bank holding companies 
certain of these securities have experienced declines in credit ratings from credit rating firms  which have devalued these specific securities 
these declines have occurred primarily over the past year due to changes in the market which has limited the demand for these securities and reduced their liquidity 
while some of these issuers have reported weaker financial performance since acquisition of these securities  they continue to possess acceptable credit risk in management s opinion 
we monitor the actual default rates and interest deferrals for possible losses and contractual shortfalls of interest or principal  which could warrant further recognition of impairment 
we recorded an otti charge of million during the year ended december  on trust preferred securities 

table of contents all of the remaining securities that are temporarily impaired are impaired due to declines in fair values resulting from changes in interest rates or increased credit liquidity spreads compared to the time they were purchased 
we have the ability to hold these securities to maturity and we expect these securities will be repaid in full  with no losses realized 
as such  management does not consider the impairments to be other than temporary

table of contents loans our loan portfolio is expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets  the absolute volume and mix of loans and the volume and mix of loans as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of our net interest margin

both commercial and consumer residential construction balances decreased million and million  respectively 
although we have been aggressive in our loan origination activity  as evidenced by the growth in our total loan portfolio  the poor market environment has impacted the demand for construction and development lending products 
approximately of our loans have adjustable rates as of december  compared to approximately at december   including adjustable rate first mortgage loans indexed to either us treasury obligations or libor and variable home equity lines of credit tied to the prime interest rate 
our variable rate loans adjust to the current interest rate environment  whereas fixed rates do not allow this flexibility 
if interest rates were to increase in the future  our interest earned on the variable rate loans would improve  and if rates were to fall  the interest we earn would decline  thus impacting our interest income 
see our discussion in interest rate sensitivity later in this section for more information on interest rate fluctuations 
the following table sets forth the maturity distribution for our loan portfolio at december  some of our loans may be renewed or repaid prior to maturity

table of contents commercial construction portfolio our commercial construction portfolio consists of construction and development loans for commercial purposes and includes loans made to builders and developers of residential real estate projects 
of the total included above  million represents loans made to borrowers for the development of residential real estate 
this segment of the portfolio has exhibited greater weakness during due to overall weakness in the residential housing sector 
as of december   million of these loans are on nonaccrual 
the breakdown of the portion of the commercial construction portfolio made to borrowers for residential real estate is as follows as of december  dollars in thousands balance number of loans raw residential land residential subdivisions single residential lots single family construction townhome construction multi family unit construction credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a borrower to meet its obligations 
we manage credit risk by evaluating the risk profile of the borrower  repayment sources  the nature of the underlying collateral  and other support given current events  conditions  and expectations 
we attempt to manage the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio through various control processes  such as credit evaluation of borrowers  establishment of lending limits  and application of lending procedures  including the holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances 
however  we seek to rely primarily on the cash flow of our borrowers as the principal source of repayment 
although credit policies and evaluation processes are designed to minimize our risk  management recognizes that loan losses will occur and the amount of these losses will fluctuate depending on the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio  as well as general and regional economic conditions 
we provide for loan losses through the establishment of an allowance for loan losses by provisions charged against earnings 
our allowance represents an estimated reserve for existing losses in the loan portfolio 
we deploy a systematic methodology for determining our allowance that includes a quarterly review process  risk rating  and adjustment to our allowance 
we classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk separately as discussed below 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance continually based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other loans that we believe require special attention 
the allowance consists of three elements specific reserves and valuation allowances for individual credits  general reserves for types or portfolios of loans based on historical loan loss experience  judgmentally adjusted for current conditions and credit risk concentrations  and unallocated reserves 
combined specific reserves and general reserves by loan type are considered allocated reserves 
all outstanding loans are considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance 
commercial our commercial portfolio includes all secured and unsecured loans to borrowers for commercial purposes  including commercial lines of credit and commercial real estate 
our process for evaluating 
table of contents commercial loans includes performing updates on all loans that we have rated for risk 
our commercial loans are generally reviewed individually  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  to determine impairment  accrual status  and the need for specific reserves 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both qualitative and quantitative 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience by loan type  collateral values  financial condition of borrowers  and other factors 
qualitative factors include judgments concerning general economic conditions that may affect credit quality  credit concentrations  the pace of portfolio growth  and delinquency levels  these qualitative factors are evaluated in connection with our unallocated portion of our allowance for loan losses 
we periodically engage outside firms and experts to independently assess our methodology and perform various loan review functions 
the process of establishing the allowance with respect to our commercial loan portfolio begins when a loan officer initially assigns each loan a risk rating  using established credit criteria 
approximately of our risk grades are subject to review and validation annually by an independent consulting firm  as well as periodically by our internal credit review function 
our methodology employs management s judgment as to the level of future losses on existing loans based on our internal review of the loan portfolio  including an analysis of the borrowers current financial position  and the consideration of current and anticipated economic conditions and their potential effects on specific borrowers and or lines of business 
in determining our ability to collect certain loans  we also consider the fair value of any underlying collateral 
we also evaluate credit risk concentrations  including trends in large dollar exposures to related borrowers  industry and geographic concentrations  and economic and environmental factors 
a commercial loan is determined to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
such a loan is not considered impaired during a minimal period of delay in payment if we expect to collect all amounts due  including past due interest 
we generally consider a minimal period of delay in payment to include delinquency up to days 
commercial loans we consider impaired at december  and december  totaled million and million  respectively 
the reserve for loan losses for commercial impaired loans was approximately million at december  and  at december  the average recorded investment in commercial impaired loans was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively  and no income has been accrued or collected on the majority of these loans while they have been classified as impaired 
the following table shows the breakout of commercial impaired loans at december dollars in thousands impaired loans with allowance for loan losses allocated in accordance with sfas impaired loans with no allowance for loan losses allocated in accordance with sfas in general  we place commercial impaired loans on nonaccrual status 
once a loan is placed on nonaccrual  it remains in nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest and the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current 
all payments made on nonaccrual loans are applied to the principal balance of the loan 

table of contents consumer our consumer portfolio includes residential mortgage loans and other loans to individuals 
consumer and residential mortgage loans  excluding repurchased and transferred alt a loans  are segregated into homogeneous pools with similar risk characteristics 
trends and current conditions in consumer and residential mortgage pools are analyzed and historical loss experience is adjusted accordingly 
quantitative and qualitative adjustment factors for the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios are consistent with those for the commercial portfolios 
certain loans in the consumer portfolio identified as having the potential for further deterioration are analyzed individually to confirm the appropriate risk rating and accrual status  and to determine the need for a specific reserve 
consumer loans originated by the bank that are greater than days past due are generally charged off 
for consumer loans originated by mariner finance  all such loans greater than days past due are considered nonaccrual and are generally charged off when they become days past due 
consumer loans we consider impaired at december  and december  consisted of alt a loans and totaled million and million  respectively  with million and million classified as nonaccrual as of december  and december   respectively 
the specific reserve for loan losses for consumer impaired loans was approximately million at december  and million at december  the average recorded investment in consumer impaired loans was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following table shows the breakout of consumer impaired loans at december dollars in thousands impaired loans with allowance for loan losses allocated in accordance with sfas impaired loans with no allowance for loan losses allocated in accordance with sfas we place consumer impaired loans on nonaccrual status as deemed necessary by relevant circumstances 
once a loan is placed on nonaccrual  it remains in nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest and the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current 
all payments made on nonaccrual loans are applied to the principal balance of the loan 
additional information about our nonaccrual loans  including interest income that we would have received had these loans been performing according to their contractual terms  is found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
repurchased mortgage loans in accordance with aicpa sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  we record repurchased loans at their estimated fair value at the time of repurchase 
at december   we maintained million of loans repurchased in accordance with covenants in our sales agreements with investors 
in establishing the loan s estimated fair value  management makes significant assumptions concerning the ultimate collectibility of delinquent loans and their ultimate realizable value 
while these projections are made with the most current data available to management  actual realized losses could differ due to the changes in the borrowers willingness or ability to resolve the delinquency status  changes in the actual volume of future repurchases  changes in the real estate market  or changes in 
table of contents market values of those loans which are liquidated 
management updates these assumptions continually as greater experience becomes available 
we believe our exposure to and resolution of our repurchase obligations are substantially complete 
we did not repurchase any loans due to early payment default during the following table shows the total portfolio of repurchased loans and their status as of december  dollars in thousands principal balance at repurchase initial write down carrying value additional allocated reserves nonaccrual st mortgages nonaccrual nd mortgages delinquent st mortgages modifications as of december  dollars in thousands principal balance at repurchase initial write down carrying value additional allocated reserves nonaccrual st mortgages nonaccrual nd mortgages delinquent st mortgages modifications current loans additional allocated reserves are included in the allowance for loan losses includes alt a loans that are days or more past due that are not on nonaccrual status  except for past due modifications includes alt a modifications that are days or more past due that are not on nonaccrual status all alt a loans which were days delinquent as of december  were evaluated individually for impairment  with any estimated loss compared to the carrying amount recorded as a specific reserve 
all other alt a loans were evaluated collectively for impairment 

table of contents the nonaccrual and delinquent loans are currently in the process of collection and the resolution of many of these loans may be through foreclosure of the property 
the modifications in the table represent repurchased loans we have renegotiated at lower rates in order to improve the borrower s ability to pay 
transferred loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities  any loans which are originally originated for sale into the secondary market and which we subsequently elect to transfer into the company s loan portfolio are valued at fair value at the time of the transfer with any decline in value recorded as a charge to operating expense 
we maintain million in first lien mortgage loans and million in second lien mortgage loans that were transferred from loans held for sale to our mortgage and consumer loan portfolios  respectively 
these loans are primarily alt a loans originated for sale and subsequently transferred as the secondary market for these products became increasingly illiquid 
all of the loans transferred were current with respect to principal and interest payments at the time of transfer 
currently  million of these loans are on nonaccrual 
specific reserves for all transferred loans amounted to  information on the activity in transferred loans and related accretable yield is as follows for the years ended december loan balance accretable yield total dollars in thousands beginning balance additional transfers loans moved to real estate acquired through foreclosure charge offs payments amortization ending balance unallocated the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for losses that are not identified when establishing the specific and general portions of the allowance and is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
such conditions include general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit quality trends including trends in delinquencies and nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio categories  recent loss experience in particular loan categories  duration of the current business cycle  bank regulatory examination results  findings of external loan review examiners  and management s judgment with respect to various other conditions including loan administration and management and the quality of risk identification systems 
executive management reviews these conditions quarterly 
we have risk management practices designed to ensure timely identification of changes in loan risk profiles  however  undetected losses may exist inherently within the loan portfolio 
the judgmental aspects involved in applying the risk grading criteria  analyzing the quality of individual loans  and assessing collateral values can also contribute to undetected  but probable  losses 

table of contents our total allowance at december  is considered by management to be sufficient to address the credit losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
however  our determination of the appropriate allowance level is based upon a number of assumptions we make about future events  which we believe are reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that our charge offs in future periods will not exceed our allowance for loan losses or that we will not need to make additional increases in our allowance for loan losses

the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the increase in the allowance reflects management s ongoing application of its methodologies to establish the allowance  which included increases in the allowance for collateral dependent impaired loans specific reserves  increases in the allowance for residential construction and development loans included in commercial construction in the above table which received internal risk rating downgrades during general reserves  as well as increases to reflect negative market trends and other qualitative factors unallocated reserves 
the allowance for loan losses may not move in direct proportion to changes in our overall trends in delinquent  nonperforming  or impaired loans 
the specific loans that make up those categories change from period to period 
impairment on those loans  which would be reflected in the allowance for loan losses  might or might not exist  depending on the specific circumstances of each loan 
specific and general reserves for the construction portfolios commercial and consumer residential and commercial mortgage loan portfolio increased million and  respectively  and reflect management s increased estimate of required reserves for these portfolios 
increased levels of delinquency  lower collateral values  and a greater number of construction and development and commercial mortgage loans receiving internal risk rating downgrades resulted in the increased allowance levels for these loan portfolios 
specific and general reserves for consumer loans increased  due to greater delinquency and collateral value declines in both repurchased and transferred alt a second mortgage loans and increased reserves related to the increased volume of consumer finance loans 
our unallocated portion 
table of contents of the allowance has also increased as general market  economic  and other factors have significantly changed during the provision for loan losses recognized to maintain the allowance was million for as compared to million for we recorded net charge offs of million during compared to net charge offs of million in  primarily due to increases in net charge offs of alt a first and second mortgages

our allowance as a percentage of outstanding loans has increased from as of december  to as of december   reflecting the changes in our loss estimates and the increases resulting from the application of our loss estimate methodology 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  
table of contents nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  expressed as a percentage of total assets  totaled at december  and at december  the following tables show the distribution of nonperforming assets and loans greater than days past due as of december dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans commercial loans and lines of credit commercial construction commercial mortgages consumer residential construction alt a first and second mortgages other residential mortgages other consumer real estate acquired through foreclosure commercial loans and lines of credit commercial construction commercial mortgages consumer residential construction alt a first and second mortgages other residential mortgages other consumer total nonperforming assets loans past due days or more and accruing commercial loans and lines of credit commercial construction commercial mortgages consumer residential construction alt a first and second mortgages other residential mortgages other consumer nonaccrual loans increased million in total 
nonaccrual construction and development loans exclusively residential increased million  reflecting negative market conditions  including slowing sales of new construction and declines in sales values 
these factors have contributed to a greater number of our borrowers in these categories becoming significantly delinquent in their payments 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline of million of alt a first and second lien mortgages classified as nonaccrual as of december  the decrease reflects a number of loans processing through foreclosure and being transferred to real estate acquired through foreclosure during nonaccrual commercial construction and consumer residential construction loans increased million from december  to december  the increase consisted of the addition of eight commercial construction loans in the amount of million and seven consumer construction loans in the amount of million  partially offset by write downs and pay downs of certain loans of approximately million and transfers to real estate acquired through foreclosure 
table of contents of approximately million 
the allowance for impaired commercial loans increased from  at december  to million as of december   which represented the fair value deficiencies for those loans for which the net fair value of the collateral was estimated at less than our carrying amount of the loan 
not all of the loans placed on nonaccrual since december  required impairment reserves  as some of the loans collateral had estimated fair values greater than the carrying amount of the loan 
real estate acquired through foreclosure remained relatively constant at million as of december  compared to million as of december  the largest category of foreclosed assets continues to be individual residential properties 
these properties have a concentration approximately in the northern virginia region and are currently being carried at approximately of their original appraised amount 
real estate acquired through foreclosure is carried at fair value and is not included as part of the allowance for loan loss totals 
loans days delinquent and accruing increased from million at december  to million as of december   primarily due to increases in delinquent commercial mortgage  commercial and consumer construction  and consumer loans 
commercial mortgage loans days delinquent and accruing grew by  and totaled million as of december  this total is made up of four loans  with the largest loan totaling  construction and development loans increased to million and consisted of four loans  with the largest loan totaling  consumer loans days delinquent and accruing increased million  and included a large first lien position home equity line of credit with a balance of million 
we expect to collect all amounts due on these loans  including interest 
troubled debt restructures tdrs troubled debt restructures  which are loans that have been restructured due to the borrower s inability to maintain a current status on the loan  that are not included in the nonaccrual balance above amounted to approximately million for and million for we initially measure impairment of tdrs on a loan by loan basis 
all of our tdrs as of december  and december  were collateral dependent and  therefore  any impairment was determined using the fair value of the collateral 
potential problem loans potential problem loans consist of loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  however  management has designated these assets as potential problem loans due to concerns about the ability of the obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms that may result from the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties 
at the end of  loans of this type that are not included in the above table of nonperforming and past due loans amounted to approximately million  compared to million at the end of potential problem commercial loans  including loans secured by real estate  increased million  while consumer residential construction potential problem loans decreased by  ninety one of the loans of total potential problem loans are commercial relationships that are well secured by commercial real estate and other business assets that are considered sufficient to collect all amounts due in the event of deterioration in the customer s financial condition 
the remaining loans of total potential problem loans are consumer residential construction loans that are well secured by property with residential real estate as the highest and best use and have an appraised value in excess of the carrying value of the loan 
the average relationship was  and the largest relationship was million 
depending on changes in the economy and other future events  these loans and others not presently identified as problem loans could be reclassified as nonperforming or impaired loans in the future 

table of contents deposits we use deposits as the primary source of funding of our loans 
we offer individuals and businesses a wide variety of deposit accounts 
these accounts include checking  savings  money market  and certificates of deposit and are obtained primarily from communities we serve 
deposits totaled million as of december   increasing million or over the december  balance of million 
the increase in deposits was primarily due to an increase in time deposits  partially offset by decreases in all other deposit categories 
during  we held approximately million in brokered time deposits  which we used to fund increased residential mortgage originations and bolster our overall liquidity position 
the mix of deposits has changed somewhat during  with a higher percentage of interest bearing nontransaction accounts and less noninterest bearing demand and interest bearing transaction accounts as of december  compared to december  additionally  we have experienced a decline in money market accounts and an increase in time deposits as customer preference has shifted to higher yielding certificates of deposit

we consider our core deposits to be all noninterest bearing  now  money market accounts less than  and saving deposits  as well as all time deposits less than  that mature in greater than one year 
at december   our core deposits were million 
the remainder of our deposits could be susceptible to attrition due to interest rate movements 
borrowings our borrowings consist of short term promissory notes issued to certain qualified investors  a warehouse line of credit closed in  short term and long term advances from the fhlb  a mortgage loan  and a line of credit to finance consumer receivables 
our short term promissory notes 
table of contents are in the form of commercial paper  which reprice daily and have maturities of days or less 
our advances from the fhlb may be in the form of short term or long term obligations 
short term advances have maturities for one year or less and can be paid without penalty 
long term borrowings through the fhlb have original maturities up to years and generally contain prepayment penalties 
long term borrowings  which totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively  consist of long term advances from the fhlb  a line of credit used to fund consumer finance receivables  and a mortgage loan on our former headquarters building 
the amortized cost of long term fhlb advances totaled million as of december  and  however  million of the advances are recorded at fair value million in accordance with sfas no 
 making the total carrying amount of fhlb advances million 
as of december  and december   the balance on the mortgage loan was million and million  respectively  and the balance on the consumer finance line of credit was million and million  respectively 
short term borrowings consist of short term promissory notes and short term advances from the fhlb 
these borrowings increased from million at december  to million at december   due to additional fhlb borrowings  partially offset by a decline in short term promissory notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for further details about our borrowings and additional borrowing capacity 
in the past  to further our funding and capital needs  we raised capital by issuing trust preferred securities through the trusts  which are wholly owned by first mariner 
the trusts used the proceeds from the sales of the trust preferred securities  combined with first mariner s equity investment in these trusts  to purchase subordinated deferrable interest debentures from first mariner 
the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts 
aggregate debentures as of december  and december  were million 
the trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable  in whole or in part  upon repayment of their underlying subordinated debentures at their respective maturities or their earlier redemption 
the subordinated debentures are redeemable prior to maturity at first mariner s option on or after its optional redemption dates 
on december   first mariner announced that it was electing to suspend interest payments on the debentures  beginning with the january  payment 
this deferment is permitted under the terms of the debentures and does not constitute an event of default 
the debentures continue to accrue interest  which will have to be fully repaid prior to the expiration of the deferral period 
the total deferral period may not exceed consecutive quarters 
first mariner has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the obligations of the trusts 
capital resources stockholders equity decreased million in to million at december  from million at december  retained deficit earnings declined by the net loss of million for common stock and additional paid in capital increased by  due to stock issued through the employee stock purchase plan  and stock compensation awards  partially offset by repurchases of common stock 
accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by million due to the decline in estimated fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio  primarily trust preferred securities and a decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swap  partially offset by the otti charge recognized in income 

table of contents banking regulatory authorities have implemented strict capital guidelines directly related to the credit risk associated with an institution s assets 
banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain capital levels based on their risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with higher defined credit risks will require more capital support than assets with lower risk 
additionally  capital must be maintained to support certain off balance sheet instruments 
to date  we have provided for our capital requirements mainly through the funds we received from stock offerings and issuances of trust preferred securities 
in the future  we may consider raising capital from time to time through an offering of common stock or other securities 
as reflected in the table below  both the company and the bank have exceeded their capital adequacy requirements as of december  and as of december   the bank was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
during  the realized net loss reduced capital to the point that as of december   the bank was considered adequately capitalized 
we continually monitor our capital adequacy ratios to ensure that we exceed regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   first mariner had a total of million in outstanding trust preferred securities  of which amount  million was eligible for and included in tier capital and million of the remaining trust preferred securities was included in tier ii capital 
the total amount of our trust preferred securities allowable as part of capital was limited to million as of december  capital is classified as tier capital common stockholders equity less certain intangible assets plus a portion of the trust preferred securities and total capital tier plus the allowed portion of the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities not included in tier capital 
minimum required levels must at least equal for tier capital and for total capital 
in addition  institutions must maintain a minimum of leverage capital ratio tier capital to average total assets for the previous quarter 
our capital position is presented in the following table december  minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provision regulatory capital ratios leverage consolidated bank tier capital to risk weighted assets consolidated bank total capital to risk weighted assets consolidated bank we have entered into agreements with the federal reserve bank of richmond  fdic  and the maryland banking commissioner 
the material terms of these agreements require us to i formulate a plan for the reduction and collection of adversely classified loans  nonaccrual loans and delinquent loans and otherwise improve our asset quality  ii develop a policy for managing the real estate we acquire by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure  iii periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses  iv develop a plan for systematically reducing and monitoring our residential real estate acquisition  development  and construction loan portfolio  v develop and implement a profit and budget plan to improve our operating performance  vi develop a capital plan 
table of contents to maintain our well capitalized status  vii submit plans to reduce parent company leverage  and viii submit plans to improve enterprise wide risk management and effectiveness of internal audit programs 
we have also agreed to provide the federal reserve bank of richmond advance notice involving significant capital transactions 
these agreements will subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and may have an adverse impact on our business operations 
failure to comply with the provisions of these agreements may result in more restrictive actions from our regulators  including more secure and restrictive enforcement actions 
liquidity liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations  including lending commitments and contingencies that arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers  as well as to meet current and planned expenditures 
these cash requirements are met on a daily basis through the inflow of deposit funds  and the maintenance of short term overnight investments  maturities and calls in our investment portfolio  and available lines of credit with the fhlb  which requires pledged collateral 
fluctuations in deposit and short term borrowing balances may be influenced by the interest rates paid  general consumer confidence  and the overall economic environment 
there can be no assurances that deposit withdrawals and loan fundings will not exceed all available sources of liquidity on a short term basis 
such a situation would have an adverse effect on our ability to originate new loans and maintain reasonable loan and deposit interest rates  which would negatively impact earnings 
the borrowing requirements of customers include commitments to extend credit and the unused portion of lines of credit collectively commitments  which totaled million at december  historically  many of the commitments expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
commitments for real estate development and construction  which totaled million  or of the total at december   are generally short term in nature  satisfying cash requirements with principal repayments as construction properties financed are generally repaid with permanent financing 
available credit lines represent the unused portion of credit previously extended and available to the customer as long as there is no violation of material contractual conditions 
commitments to extend credit for residential mortgage loans of million  or of the total at december   generally expire within days 
commercial commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit of million  or  of the total at december   generally do not extend for more than months 
consumer commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit of million  or of the total at december   are generally open ended 
at december   available home equity lines totaled million  or of the total 
home equity credit lines generally extend for a period of years  before being converted to an amortizing loan 
capital expenditures for various branch locations and equipment can be a significant use of liquidity 
as of december   we plan on expending approximately  in the next months on our premises and equipment 
customer withdrawals are also a principal use of liquidity  but are generally mitigated by growth in customer funding sources  such as deposits and short term borrowings 
while balances may fluctuate up and down in any given period  historically we have experienced a steady increase in total customer funding sources 
the bank s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents which are cash on hand or amounts due from financial institutions  federal funds sold  money market mutual funds  and interest bearing deposits  available for sale and trading securities  loans held for sale  deposit accounts  brokered deposits  and borrowings 
the levels of such sources are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  and investing activities at any given time 
we continue to primarily rely on core deposits 
table of contents from customers to provide stable and cost effective sources of funding to support our loan growth 
we also seek to augment such deposits with longer term and higher yielding certificates of deposit 
cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million at december   have immediate availability to meet our short term funding needs 
our entire investment portfolio is classified as either available for sale or trading  is highly marketable  and available to meet our liquidity needs 
loans held for sale  which totaled million at december   are committed to be sold into the secondary market and generally are funded within days 
our residential real estate portfolio includes loans that are underwritten to secondary market criteria and provide us an additional source of liquidity 
additionally  our residential construction loan portfolio provides a source of liquidity as construction periods generally range from months  and these loans are subsequently financed with permanent first mortgages and sold into the secondary market 
our loan to deposit ratio stood at as of december  and at december  we also have the ability to utilize established credit as an additional source of liquidity 
to use the vast majority of our credit lines  we must pledge certain loans and or investment securities before advances can be obtained 
as of december   we maintained lines of credit totaling million  with funding capacity of million based upon loans and investments eligible and available for pledging 
we are not aware of any known trends  demands  commitments  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes in our liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is an important factor in the management of the composition and maturity configurations of our earning assets and our funding sources 
the primary objective of our asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of our primary earnings component  net interest income 
our net interest income can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
we may attempt to structure the statement of financial condition so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
however  imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in time may be appropriate to mitigate risks from fee income subject to interest rate risk  such as mortgage banking activities 
the measurement of our interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the techniques used in asset liability management 
interest sensitive gap is the dollar difference between our assets and liabilities which are subject to interest rate pricing within a given time period  including both floating rate or adjustable rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
our management and our board of directors oversee the asset liability management function and meet periodically to monitor and manage the statement of financial condition  control interest rate exposure  and evaluate pricing strategies 
we evaluate the asset mix of the statement of financial condition continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  funding sources  and liquidity 
our management of the liability mix of the statement of financial condition focuses on expanding our various funding sources and promotion of deposit products with desirable repricing or maturity characteristics 
in theory  we can diminish interest rate risk through maintaining a nominal level of interest rate sensitivity 
in practice  this is made difficult by a number of factors including cyclical variation in loan demand  different impacts on our interest sensitive assets and liabilities when interest rates change  and the availability of our funding sources 
accordingly  we strive to manage the interest rate sensitivity gap by adjusting the maturity of and establishing rates on the earning asset portfolio and certain interest bearing liabilities commensurate with our expectations relative to market interest rates 
additionally  we may employ the use of off balance sheet instruments  such as interest rate swaps or caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
generally  we attempt to maintain a balance between 
table of contents rate sensitive assets and liabilities that is appropriate to minimize our overall interest rate risk  not just our net interest margin 
our interest rate sensitivity position as of december  is presented in the following table 
our assets and liabilities are scheduled based on maturity or repricing data except for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities that are based on prevailing prepayments assumptions and core deposits which are based on core deposit studies done for banks in the mid atlantic region 
these assumptions are validated periodically by management 
the difference between our rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities or the interest rate sensitivity gap  is shown at the bottom of the table 
as of december   our cumulative interest sensitive liabilities exceeded our cumulative interest sensitive assets within a one year period by million or of total assets  compared to interest sensitive assets exceeding interest sensitive liabilities by million or as of december  the change in our interest rate sensitivity gap occurred primarily due to additional short term borrowings and shorter term certificates of deposit during dollars in thousands days or less days one year one five years years or non sensitive total interest earning assets interest bearing deposits investment securities restricted stock investments loans held for sale loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts now accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit borrowings and junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitive gap position period of assets cumulative of assets cumulative risk sensitive assets to risk sensitive liabilities while we monitor interest rate sensitivity reports  we primarily test our interest rate sensitivity through the deployment of simulation analysis 
we use earnings simulation models to estimate what effect specific interest rate changes would have on our net interest income and net income 
simulation analysis provides us with a more rigorous and dynamic measure of interest sensitivity 
changes in prepayments have been included where changes in behavior patterns are assumed to be significant to the simulation  particularly mortgage related assets 
call features on certain securities and borrowings are based on their call probability in view of the projected rate change  and pricing features such as interest rate floors are incorporated 
our fee income produced by mortgage banking operations may also be impacted by changes in rates 
as long term rates increase  the volume of fixed rate mortgage 
table of contents loans originated for sale in the secondary market may decline and reduce our revenues generated by this line of business 
we attempt to structure our asset and liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net interest income by changes in market interest rates 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage interest rate risk so as to avoid significant adverse effects on net interest income 
at december   the simulation model provided the following profile of our interest rate risk measured over a one year time horizon  assuming a parallel shift in a yield curve based off the us dollar forward swap curve adjusted for certain pricing assumptions immediate rate change bp bp net interest income both of the above tools used to assess interest rate risk have strengths and weaknesses 
because the gap analysis reflects a static position at a single point in time  it is limited in quantifying the total impact of market rate changes which do not affect all earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally or simultaneously 
in addition  gap reports depict the existing structure  excluding exposure arising from new business 
while the simulation process is a powerful tool in analyzing interest rate sensitivity  many of the assumptions used in the process are highly qualitative and subjective  and are subject to the risk that past historical activity may not generate accurate predictions of the future 
the model also assumes parallel movements in interest rates  which means both short term and long term rates will change equally 
nonparallel changes in interest rates short term rates changing differently from long term rates could result in significant differences in projected income amounts when compared to parallel tests 
both measurement tools taken together  however  provide an effective evaluation of our exposure to changes in interest rates  enabling management to better control the volatility of earnings 
we are party to mortgage rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans at interest rates previously agreed locked by both us and the borrower for specified periods of time 
when the borrower locks an interest rate  we effectively extend a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but we must honor the interest rate for the specified time period 
we are exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments and loans prior to sale 
we utilize forward sales commitments to economically hedge the changes in fair value of the loan due to changes in market interest rates 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business 
these arrangements consist primarily of commitments to extend credit  lines of credit and letters of credit  potential loan repurchases  certain contractual obligations  and certain derivatives 
credit commitments credit commitments are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition to the contract 
loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts  fixed expiration dates  and may require payment of a fee 
lines of credit generally have variable interest rates 
such lines do not represent future cash requirements because it is unlikely that all customers will draw upon their lines in full at any time 
letters of credit are commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 

table of contents our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is the contract amount of the commitment 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are made on the same terms  including collateral  as outstanding loans 
we are not aware of any accounting loss we would incur by funding our commitments 
outstanding loan commitments  unused lines of credit  and letters of credit were as follows at december  dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit unused lines of credit letters of credit potential loan repurchases we are not aware of any repurchase obligations pending as of december  contractual obligations first mariner has certain obligations to make future payments under contract 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments are payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than one year over years over years after years certificates of deposit borrowings and junior subordinated debentures annual rental commitments under noncancelable leases derivatives we maintain and account for hedging derivatives  in the form of swaps  interest rate lock commitments  and forward sales commitments  in accordance with sfas no

we recognize gains and losses on swap contracts in the consolidated statement of financial condition in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax effects 
we recognize any gains and losses on interest rate lock commitments or forward sales commitments on loan pipeline through mortgage banking revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
mariner finance has entered into swap contracts to hedge the economic impact of its consumer finance receivables line of credit 
the swap is intended to decrease the volatility of the variable nature of the interest rate associated with the line of credit and ultimately decrease interest sensitivity 
the bank  through first mariner mortgage  enters into interest rate lock commitments  under which we originate residential mortgage loans with interest rates determined prior to funding 
rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that we intend to sell in the secondary market are considered derivatives 
the period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from days to days 
for these rate lock commitments  we protect the 
table of contents company from changes in interest rates through the use of forward sales commitments  primarily in bulk mandatory delivery 
under mandatory delivery commitments  we are exposed to price risk from the time a rate lock commitment is made to a mortgage applicant until the time the mortgage loan is sold 
to manage this risk we use forward sales of agency mortgage backed securities 
additionally  under mandatory delivery commitments  we remain exposed to basis risk in that the changes in value of our hedges may not equal or completely offset the changes in value of the rate commitments being hedged 
this can result due to changes in the market demand for our mortgage loans brought about by supply and demand considerations and perceptions about credit risk relative to the agency securities 
we also mitigate counterparty risk by entering into mandatory delivery commitments with proven counterparties and forward sales of mortgage backed securities with pre approved financial intermediaries 
the market value of rate lock commitments is not readily ascertainable with precision because rate lock commitments are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
the bank determines the fair value of rate lock commitments by measuring the change in the value of the underlying asset  while taking into consideration the probability that the rate lock commitments will close 
information pertaining to the carrying amounts of our derivative financial instruments follows as of december dollars in thousands notional amount estimated fair value notional amount estimated fair value interest rate swaps interest rate lock commitments forward contracts to sell mortgage backed securities changes in interest rates could materially affect the fair value of the swaps  the interest rate lock commitments  or the forward sales commitments 
in the case of the loan related derivatives  fair value is also impacted by the probability that the rate lock commitment will close fallout factor 
in addition  changes in interest rates could result in changes in the fallout factor  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
this is because the impact of an interest rate shift on the fallout ratio is non symmetrical and non linear 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation may be expected to have an impact on our operating costs and thus on net income 
a prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates  wages  and other costs to increase and could adversely affect our results of operations unless the fees we charge could be increased correspondingly 
our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of part ii of this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
we believe that the impact of inflation was not material for or recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements

results review for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million or per diluted share  a decrease of from net income of million or per diluted share in our gross revenue net interest income and noninterest income decreased million and our noninterest expenses  the provision for credit losses  and income taxes increased by million 
our net interest income for decreased million or from  primarily due to lower levels of earning assets and higher levels of nonperforming assets  which more than offset an increase in the net interest margin 
the yield on average earning assets increased from for to for and the rates on average interest bearing liabilities increased from for to for rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased due to increased market interest rates 
although market interest rates declined over the last half of  they were still higher on average than for the same time in earning asset rate increases were also favorably impacted by a higher mix of higher yielding consumer loans as a percentage of earning assets 
average earning assets decreased from the level of billion to billion for  while average interest bearing liabilities decreased from the level of billion to million for our net interest margin increased basis points to in compared to in our provision for loan losses increased to million in from million in our allowance for loan losses at december  represented of loans outstanding  an increase from december  of of loans outstanding

table of contents 
the decrease was mostly due to a decrease in our revenue from mortgage banking activities due to lower loan sales volumes  reversals of gains recognized on previously sold mortgage loans which had to be repurchased  and lower profit spreads on loans sold 
brokerage fees increased  during  as we realized higher mutual fund and annuity sales and asset management fees 
deposit service charges declined to million in from million for due to lower overdraft income 
income from boli increased by  due to the purchase of additional insurance policies in the second half of and the conversion of several existing policies to new carriers with higher crediting yields 
insurance sales commissions increased  due to increased insurance product sales from mariner finance 
we recognized  in trading losses during  mainly due to declines in value of borrowings accounted for at fair value 
our noninterest expenses increased million or to million for compared to million for the same period of increased write downs of real estate acquired through foreclosure and write downs on alt a loans were the most significant factor in the increase in noninterest expenses 
excluding the write downs of real estate acquired through foreclosure and alt a loans  noninterest expense increased million or 
our salary and employee benefits expenses increased million  or  due to additional personnel costs for staffing hired to support the expansion of the consumer finance company and increased cost of employer provided health care 
also included is  for severance benefits for the period  mostly related to the closing of wholesale lending operations 
occupancy expenses increased million to million from million in  primarily due to additional space for the new executive and administrative offices  which we began to occupy in the third quarter of and occupied for the entire year of occupancy expenses also increased due to additional offices of mariner finance and approximately  of expense to sublease our former wholesale mortgage offices 
professional fees increased  as a result of increased legal fees associated with foreclosures 
service and maintenance expense and furniture  fixtures  and equipment expense also increased  and  respectively due to increased locations 
fdic insurance premiums increased  from  in to  in due to an increase in our insurance rates during we recorded an income tax benefit of million on a net loss before taxes of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of for in comparison to an income tax benefit of  on income before taxes of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of for the increase in the tax benefit was primarily driven by the decrease in pretax income 
also impacting the tax benefit was the increase in the state of maryland income tax rates effective january  
table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk results of operations for financial institutions  including us  may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  including declines in real estate values  rapid changes in interest rates and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
our loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in central maryland and portions of maryland s eastern shore and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with these local economies 
the united states has entered into an economic downturn 
the economic downturn generally  and the disruptions in the capital markets in particular  have decreased liquidity and increased our cost of debt and equity capital  where available 
the longer these conditions persist  the greater the probability that these factors could continue to increase our costs and significantly limit our access to debt and equity capital  and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
many of the customers to which we have made  or will make  loans may also be susceptible to the economic downturn  which may affect the ability of our customers to repay loans  thereby  increasing the level of our nonperforming assets 
the economic downturn may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans  as well as the value of our securities investments  which could affect our operations and financial results  as well as decrease our ability to borrow under our credit facilities or raise equity capital 
the economic downturn has affected the availability of credit generally and may prevent us from replacing or renewing our credit facilities on reasonable terms  if at all 
we do not know when market conditions will stabilize  if adverse conditions will intensify  or the full extent to which the disruptions will affect us 
also  it is possible that continued instability of the financial markets could have other  unforeseen material effects on our business 
as of december   we have a significant amount of loans that we either repurchased from investors or transferred from our held for sale portfolio with collateral located in northern virginia  where the housing market has declined dramatically 
see our discussion of repurchased loans in item of part ii of this report under the heading credit risk management 
we also face market risk related to interest rates that arises from our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is largely dependent on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
for a discussion of this interest rate risk  see item of part ii of this report under the heading interest rate sensitivity
