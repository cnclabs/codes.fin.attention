we conduct a significant portion of our operations in foreign countries 
approximately and of our consolidated service revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  were from non us operations 
because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on our operating results 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in euros and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in pounds sterling 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in euros and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in pounds sterling 
as a result of the strengthening us dollar against the pound sterling and the euro in fiscal year  our revenues and costs decreased in fiscal year as compared with the amounts in fiscal year  translated using the fiscal year foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately of our contracts are fixed rate  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flows from these contracts typically consist of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s 
table of contents duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  our clients can terminate their contracts with us upon thirty to sixty days notice or can delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or clinical drug manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the product 
acquisitions acquisitions are an important component of our business strategy 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
since june   we have completed the following acquisitions clinphone in august  we completed the acquisition of clinphone  one of the world s leading clinical technology organizations  for approximately million  comprised of million for the stock of clinphone and million as repayment of clinphone s existing debt 
we believe that the acquisition of clinphone has advanced our position as a clinical technology leader 
biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly requested technology solutions and expertise to support the full range of clinical development activities while improving the speed and efficiency of clinical programs 
we believe that the broad technological offering that we now provide gives clients a more comprehensive and robust suite of clinical information technologies 
apex in september  we acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of taiwan based apex international clinical research co  ltd 
apex and completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of apex in november for a total of approximately million 
the acquisition strengthened our global capabilities  providing clients with a wider range of clinical research service offerings throughout the asia pacific region  including mainland china  hong kong  india  taiwan  singapore  indonesia  south korea  malaysia  thailand  the philippines  new zealand  and australia 
bmr cct in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of behavioral and medical research  llc bmr and caused the transfer of all of the outstanding stock of california clinical trials medical group  inc cct for approximately million 
established in with headquarters in san diego  bmr cct provided a broad range of specialty phase i iv clinical research services through four clinical sites in california 
in connection with the transaction  we entered into a long term management agreement with cct 
at the time  the acquisition expanded our global clinical pharmacology capacity to over beds 
it also brought new expertise to the company s service offerings in the area of bridging studies  especially japanese bridging studies  and added depth to our existing expertise in central nervous system clinical trials  neuroscience drug development services and sleep studies 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved or the susceptibility of such matter to change and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition we recognize service revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the service offering has been delivered to the client  iii the collection of fees is probable  and iv amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
our crs and pcms client arrangements generally involve multiple service deliverables  where bundled service deliverables are accounted for in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we have determined that each of our service deliverables has standalone value and have established objective evidence of fair value for each of our service deliverables based on the price charged when sold to other similar customers 
accordingly  revenues are recognized upon delivery of actual units and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
within perceptive s clinphone rtsm ivr business  we provide software as a service through hosting and other support services over a specific term 
revenue from hosting service arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the hosting arrangement  including customary and expected extensions 
fees charged and costs incurred in the setup stage of these arrangements are deferred until the start of the hosting period and are amortized and recognized ratably over the estimated hosting period 
within the ctms operating unit of perceptive  software revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis due to the significant nature of customization of each project 
within the edc operating unit of perceptive  revenue is recognized ratably over the contract service period 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or cash received in advance of revenue recognized 
critical management estimates may be involved in the determination of fair value  stand alone value  hosting period  and other revenue elements 
changes to these elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
billed accounts receivable  unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or payments received for which revenue has not yet been earned 
we maintain a provision for losses on receivables based on historical collectability and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
in the event that we are unable to collect portions of our outstanding billed or unbilled receivables  there may be a material impact to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 

table of contents income taxes our global provision for corporate income taxes is determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances 
in addition  fin mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in income tax reporting positions 
we are subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities that may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is based on judgment 
we believe we have adequately provided for any uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequent testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit below its fair value 
the impairment testing involves determining the fair market value of each of the reporting units with which the goodwill was associated and comparing that value with the reporting unit s carrying value 
due in part to the recent uncertainties in the stock market  the share price of our stock had decreased dramatically 
as a result  we conducted an impairment assessment in fiscal year using a discounted cash flow analysis at the reporting unit level to determine fair value 
this analysis included significant judgment regarding the assumptions used  such as our weighted average cost of capital  revenue growth rates  profit margins  capital expenditures  and other factors that were all based on current strategic forecasts and other financial metrics 
as of june   there were no required adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill at any of our reporting units 
variations over time in the measures and estimates used in the discounted cash flow analysis could result in future impairment of goodwill that could have a material impact to our financial position or our results of operations 

table of contents results of operations note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k provides a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended june  and analysis by segment we evaluate our segment performance and allocate resources based on service revenue and gross profit service revenue less direct costs  while other operating costs are allocated and evaluated on a geographic basis

additional lines of credit we have a line of credit with abn amro bank  nv in the amount of euro million 
this line of credit is not collateralized  is payable on demand  and bears interest at an annual rate ranging between and 
the line of credit may be revoked or canceled by the bank at any time at its discretion 
we primarily entered into this line of credit to facilitate business transactions with the bank 
at june   we had euro million available under this line of credit 
we also have a line of credit with hsbc uk in the amount of million pounds sterling 
this line of credit was established by clinphone and is guaranteed by parexel international holding bv 
the line is not secured

at june   we had million pounds sterling available under this line of credit 
we have an unsecured line of credit with jp morgan uk in the amount of million that bears interest at an annual rate ranging between and 
we primarily entered into this line of credit to facilitate business transactions with the bank 
at june   we had million available under this line of credit 
we have other foreign lines of credit with banks totaling million 
these lines of credit are used as overdraft protection and bear interest at annual rates ranging from and 
the lines of credit are payable on demand 
at june   we had million available under these arrangements 
we have a cash pooling arrangement with abn amro bank 
pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the overall net position is used as a basis by the bank for calculating the overall pool interest amount 
each legal entity owned by parexel and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit deposit or debit overdraft balance 
therefore  interest income is earned by legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged to legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s overall balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference 
the gross overdraft balance related to this pooling arrangement was million and million at june  and june   respectively 
we have financing agreements with a vendor to finance software purchases 
the agreements carry four year terms and bear annual interest rates ranging between to 
as of june   the balance on the promissory notes issued in connection with the financing agreements was million 
financing needs our primary cash needs are for operating expenses  such as salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting  business development and facilities  and for business acquisitions  capital expenditures and repayment of principal and interest on our borrowings 
our requirements for cash to pay principal and interest on our borrowings will increase significantly in future periods because we borrowed approximately million under the credit facility in august to finance the acquisition of clinphone 
our only committed external source of funds is under our credit facility described above 
our principal source of cash is from the performance of services under contracts with our clients 
if we were unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients or if the level of contract cancellations increased  our revenue and cash flow would be adversely affected see part ii  item a risk factors for further detail 
absent a material adverse change in the level of our new business bookings or contract cancellations  we believe that our existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs over the next twelve months and on a longer term basis 
depending upon our revenue and cash flow from operations  it is possible that we will require external funds to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility upon maturity in we expect to continue to acquire businesses to enhance our service and product offerings  expand our therapeutic expertise  and or increase our global presence  however  we are currently focused on integrating our recent acquisitions 
depending on their size  any such acquisitions may require additional external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
we may be unable to secure such financing at all or on terms acceptable to us  as a result of our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
in addition  under the terms of the credit facility  interest rates are fixed based on market indices at the time of borrowing and  depending upon the interest mechanism selected by us  may float thereafter 
as a result  the amount of interest payable by us on our borrowings may increase if market interest rates change

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we derived approximately of our consolidated service revenue for the twelve months ended june  from operations outside of the us  of which was denominated in euros and was denominated in pounds sterling 
we derived approximately of our consolidated service revenue for the twelve months ended june  from operations outside of the us  of which was denominated in euros and was denominated in pounds sterling 
we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
it is our policy to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and in market rates of interest 
accordingly  we have instituted foreign currency hedging programs and an interest rate swap program 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information on our hedging programs and interest rate swap program 
as of june   the programs with derivatives designated as hedging instruments under sfas were deemed effective and the notional values of the derivatives were approximately million  including an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million in connection with the borrowings under our credit facility 
under certain circumstances  such as the occurrence of significant differences between actual cash receipts and forecasted cash receipts  the sfas programs could be deemed ineffective 
in that event  the unrealized gains and losses related to these derivatives  and currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  would be recognized in earnings 
as of june   the estimated amount that could be recognized in other income is a loss of approximately million  net of tax 
as of june   the notional value of derivatives that were not designated as hedging instruments under sfas was approximately million 
the potential change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts that would result from a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would be approximately million 
during the twelve months ended june  and  we recorded foreign exchange gains of million and foreign exchange losses of million 
we acknowledge our exposure to additional foreign exchange risk as it relates to assets and liabilities that are not part of the economic hedge program  but quantification of this risk is difficult to assess at any given point in time 
our exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to the amount of our short term and long term debt 
short term debt was million at june  and million at june  long term debt was million at june  and million at june
