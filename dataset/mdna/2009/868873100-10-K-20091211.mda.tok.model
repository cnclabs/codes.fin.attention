item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and trends for the future should be read together with selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
any discussion and analysis regarding trends in our future financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as more fully identified in forward looking statements and risk factors 
our actual future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
overview surmodics is a leading provider of drug delivery and surface modification technologies to the healthcare industry 
in november  we announced a change in our organizational structure into four clinically and market focused business units cardiovascular  ophthalmology  surmodics pharmaceuticals  and in vitro technologies 
we believe that this structure improves the visibility  marketing and adoption of the company s broad array of technologies within specific markets and helps our customers in the medical device  pharmaceutical and life science industries better solve unmet clinical needs 
in addition  a new centralized research and development function has been formed to serve the needs of the company s clinically and market focused business units  other than the surmodics pharmaceuticals business unit  which continues to maintain certain r d operations 
the reorganization change resulted in the company being comprised of new market focused business units 
therapeutic contains the cardiovascular business unit  which provides drug delivery and surface modification technologies to customers in the cardiovascular market  the ophthalmology business unit  which is dedicated to the advancement of treatments for eye diseases  such as age related macular degeneration amd and diabetic macular edema dme  two of the leading causes of blindness  and the surmodics pharmaceuticals business unit  which provides proprietary polymer based drug delivery technologies to companies developing improved pharmaceutical products 
revenue results in therapeutic are presented by the clinical market areas in which our customers participate cardiovascular  ophthalmology and other markets 
diagnostic contains the in vitro technologies business unit  which includes our microarray slide technologies  our stabilization products  antigens and substrates for immunoassay diagnostic tests  and our in vitro diagnostic format technology 

table of contents our revenue is derived from three primary sources royalties and license fees from licensing our proprietary drug delivery and surface modification technologies and in vitro diagnostic formats to customers  the vast majority typically in excess of of revenue in the royalties and license fees category is in the form of royalties  the sale of polymers and reagent chemicals  stabilization products  antigens  substrates and microarray slides to the diagnostics and biomedical research industry  and research and development fees generated on customer projects 
revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors our customers success in selling products incorporating our technologies  the timing of introductions of licensed products by customers  the timing of introductions of products that compete with our customers products  the number and activity level associated with customer development projects  the number and terms of new license agreements that are finalized  the value of reagent chemicals and other products sold to customers  and the timing of future acquisitions we complete  if any 
for financial accounting and reporting purposes  we report our results in one reportable segment 
we made this determination because each business unit has similar economic characteristics  a significant percentage of our employees provide support services including research and development to each business unit  technology and products from each business unit are marketed to the same or similar customers  each business unit uses the same sales and marketing resources  and each business unit operates in the same regulatory environment 
in june  we entered into a license and research collaboration agreement and separate supply agreement with merck co  inc merck related to our i vation tm ta triamcinolone acetonide intravitreal implant 
under the terms of the merck agreements  we received an up front license fee of million and were eligible to receive up to an additional million in fees and development milestones associated with the successful product development and attainment of appropriate us and eu regulatory approvals  as well as payment for our research and development activities 
in september  following a strategic review of its business and product development portfolio  merck gave notice that it was terminating the collaborative research and license agreement  as well as the supply agreement entered into in june this decision was not based on any concerns about the safety or efficacy of the i vation system 
the termination was effective in december  and we have recognized revenue related to the termination of approximately million in fiscal  principally from amounts that previously had been deferred and amortized under the accounting treatment required by accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the million includes a million milestone payment associated with the termination of the triamcinolone acetonide development program 
in november  we acquired a portfolio of intellectual property and collaborative drug delivery projects from pr pharmaceuticals  inc  a drug delivery company specializing in injectable  biodegradable sustained release formulations 
total consideration paid through september  was million and pr pharmaceuticals  inc is eligible to receive up to an additional million in cash upon successful achievement of specified milestones 
the proprietary technologies we acquired complement and enhance our existing portfolio of drug delivery capabilities by providing a broader toolkit for protein delivery and the ability to use smaller gauge needles for microparticle injections 
in addition  the multiple customer development programs we assumed complement the diversified portfolio of customer projects at surmodics pharmaceuticals  and we believe will further leverage the investment we are making in cgmp manufacturing 
on october   we entered into a license and development agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche  ltd 
roche and genentech  inc  a wholly owned member of the roche group genentech 
under the terms of the license agreement  roche and genentech will have an exclusive license to develop and commercialize a sustained drug delivery formulation of lucentis ranibizumab injection utilizing surmodics proprietary biodegradable microparticles drug delivery system 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an up front licensing fee of million and are eligible to receive potential payments of up to approximately million in fees and milestone payments in the event of the successful development and commercialization of multiple products  as well as payment for development work done on these products 
roche and genentech will have the right to obtain manufacturing services from surmodics 
in the event a commercial product is developed  we will also receive royalties on sales of such products 

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements is based in part on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following are critical areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with accounting guidance  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred or delivery has occurred if the terms specify destination  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
however  when there are additional performance requirements  revenue is recognized when such requirements have been satisfied 
royalty revenue is generated when a licensed customer sells products incorporating our technologies 
royalty revenue is recognized as our licensees report it to us  and payment is typically submitted concurrently with a quarterly report 
revenue related to a performance milestone is recognized upon achievement of the milestone and meeting specific revenue recognition criteria 
we recognize initial license fees over the term of the related agreement 
minimum royalty fees are recognized in the period earned 
product sales to third parties are recognized at the time of shipment  provided that an order has been received  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and returns can be reasonably estimated 
our sales terms provide no right of return outside of our standard warranty policy 
payment terms are generally set at days 
generally  revenue for research and development is recorded as performance progresses under the applicable contract 
when we have revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we comply with current accounting guidance and recognize each element as it is earned 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized except for services related to the merck agreement  which have been recognized as incurred 
customer advances are accounted for as a liability until all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
valuation of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of long lived assets  such as property and equipment 
if such events or circumstances were to indicate that the carrying amount of these assets would not be recoverable  we would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges or other measure of fair value were less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would recognize an impairment charge 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquired entities over the fair value assigned to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed in connection with the company s acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment in accordance with accounting guidance 
under certain situations  interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill 
a reporting unit is a component of our results for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis 
surmodics has determined that its reporting units are its surmodics pharmaceuticals business unit  a component within therapeutics  and the in vitro technologies business unit 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal and did not record an impairment charge 
in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired  we compared the fair value of reporting units to which goodwill is assigned to their carrying value step one of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used a valuation technique based on multiples of revenue and book value for comparable companies since the technique is consistent with the objective of measuring fair value 
the comparison companies selected have 
table of contents operations comparable to each of the surmodics reporting units for which indefinite lived assets were being evaluated 
investments 
investments consist principally of us government and government agency obligations and mortgage backed securities and are classified as available for sale or held to maturity at september  our investment policy calls for no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations  net of tax 
available for sale investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment in accordance with accounting guidance 
our evaluation of the available for sale investments resulted in no loss recognition in fiscal and loss recognition of million related to our investment in octoplus nv included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets in fiscal  as we determined the loss to be an other than temporary impairment based on a significant decline in the stock price as of september  the impairment of the octoplus nv investment resulted in a new cost basis 
investments which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
if there is an other than temporary impairment in the fair value of any individual security classified as held to maturity  the company will write down the security to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to other income loss 
interest on debt securities  including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  is included in other income loss 
realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities  which are included in other income loss  are determined using the specific identification method 
income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
when preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in the results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we had total deferred tax assets in excess of total deferred tax liabilities of million as of september  and million as of september   including valuation allowances of million as of september  and million as of september  the valuation allowances related to impairment losses on investments and were recorded because the company does not currently foresee future capital gains within the allowable carry forward and carry back periods to offset these capital losses when they are recognized 
as such  no tax benefit has been recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
the company adopted accounting provisions on october  which defined new standards for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of september  and was million and million  respectively  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
million of these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate  if recognized 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions 
table of contents are included in our income tax provision 
as of september  and  million and million  respectively  of interest and penalties were accrued  excluding the tax benefits of deductible interest 
fiscal years  and remain subject to examination by federal tax authorities 
tax returns for state and local jurisdictions for fiscal years through remain subject to examination by state and local tax authorities 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or local jurisdiction  all years remain subject to examination by the tax authorities 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
within the next months  we do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact of adopting this new standard as well as changes in unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal and results of operations years ended september  and fiscal fiscal increase dollars in thousands decrease change revenue therapeutic cardiovascular ophthalmology other markets total therapeutic diagnostic total revenue revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal the increase in therapeutic and decrease in diagnostic revenue  as detailed in the table above  are further explained in the narrative below 
therapeutic 
revenue in therapeutic was million in fiscal  a increase compared with million in the prior year period 
the increase in total revenue reflects the recognition of revenue of approximately million associated with the terminated merck collaborative research and license agreement 
excluding these significant event specific items  therapeutic revenue decreased million  or 
cardiovascular derives a substantial amount of revenue from royalties and license fees and product sales attributable to cordis corporation  a johnson johnson company  on its cypher sirolimus eluting coronary stent 
the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics polymer coating that delivers a therapeutic drug designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 
the cypher stent faces continuing competition from boston scientific  medtronic  and abbott laboratories 
stents from these companies compete directly with the cypher stent both domestically and internationally 
future royalty and reagent sales revenue could decrease as a result of lower cypher stent sales as a result of the ongoing and expected future competition 
we anticipate that royalty revenue from the cypher stent may be volatile throughout fiscal and beyond as the various marketers of drug eluting stents compete in the marketplace and as others enter the marketplace 
we also receive a royalty on sales of the medtronic endeavor drug eluting stent delivery system incorporating our hydrophilic technology  which is sold in the united states and internationally and commenced sales in japan in may cardiovascular revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal  compared with the prior year period principally as a result of lower royalties and license fees and research and development revenue 
our royalty revenue from cordis decreased approximately as a result of the decrease in cypher stent sales 

table of contents ophthalmology revenue increased million  or  in fiscal  compared with the prior year period 
the significant increase principally reflects the recognition of approximately million of previously deferred revenue associated with the terminated collaborative research and license agreement with merck and a milestone payment associated with the termination of the triamcinolone acetonide development program 
ophthalmology revenue  excluding the merck event specific items of fiscal and amortization of revenue in fiscal  was unchanged at million in both fiscal years 
other markets revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal  compared with the prior year period 
lower research and development revenue was the primary reason for the decrease 
selected customers have delayed  slowed or cancelled development projects in fiscal as a result of various factors including current economic conditions 
other markets revenue is derived from more than customers 
diagnostic 
revenue in diagnostic was million in fiscal  a decrease of compared with million in the prior year period 
this decrease was attributable to lower royalties and license fees in fiscal in past years  diagnostic derived a significant percentage of revenue from abbott laboratories 
fiscal was the last year in which we received royalty revenue from our diagnostic format patent license agreement with abbott laboratories 
royalty revenue from abbott was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal product sales in diagnostic decreased compared with fiscal as customers slowed purchasing activity in early fiscal product costs 
product costs were million in fiscal  an decrease from the prior year 
overall product margins averaged  compared with in the prior year 
the increase in product margins reflected the mix of products sold in fiscal as we had a decrease in sales of our surmodics pharmaceuticals polymer products  which carry lower margins than our reagent and diagnostic products 
customer research and development expenses 
customer research and development customer r d expenses were million  a decrease of compared with fiscal the decrease principally reflects the impact of lower research and development revenue  adjusted for merck 
customer r d margins were  compared with in fiscal the margins were and for fiscal and  respectively  after adjusting for merck deferred revenue recognition in both periods 
the increase in fiscal margins reflects lower labor and material costs incurred on projects  as well as lower overhead costs allocated to customer r d 
other research and development expenses 
other research and development other r d expenses were million  essentially unchanged compared with million in fiscal our research and development headcount decreased in fiscal as a result of our november reorganization  resulting in lower labor costs  which were offset by higher overhead costs being allocated to other r d 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  a decrease of compared with fiscal the decrease principally reflects lower employee compensation costs related to our annual incentive compensation program and lower stock based compensation expense  as fiscal included costs related to transitions on our board of directors 
purchased in process research and development 
in november  we acquired certain assets comprised of intellectual property and collaborative programs from pr pharmaceuticals  inc the fair value of million associated with the in process research and development intangible asset was determined by management and recognized as an expense 
restructuring charges 
in november  we announced a functional reorganization to better serve our customers and improve our operating performance 
as a result of the reorganization  we eliminated positions  or approximately of our workforce 
these employee terminations occurred across various functions  and the reorganization plan was completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal the reorganization also resulted in surmodics vacating a leased office facility in eden prairie  minnesota  and consolidating into our owned office and research facility also in eden prairie 
we recorded total restructuring charges of million in connection with the reorganization 
these pre tax charges consisted of million of severance pay and benefits expenses and million of facility related costs 

table of contents costs totaling million have been paid  and we anticipate paying the remaining million within the next fifteen months 
other income loss  net 
other income was million in fiscal  compared with a loss of million in fiscal income from investments was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the decrease primarily reflects lower investment balances in fiscal the fiscal loss primarily reflects a million impairment loss on our investment in octoplus nv  based on a significant decline in the stock price as of september  income tax expense 
the income tax provision was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal excluding the impact of the million impairment loss in fiscal since the company does not currently foresee offsetting capital gains that could offset this capital loss  no tax benefit has been recorded  the effective tax rate was 
the decrease in the effective tax rate  adjusted for the one time item noted  is primarily a result of lower state taxes and the tax reserve associated with uncertain tax positions 
years ended september  and fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands increase change revenue therapeutic cardiovascular ophthalmology other markets total therapeutic diagnostic total revenue revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal we experienced growth in both therapeutic and diagnostic  as detailed in the table above and further explained in the narrative below 
therapeutic 
revenue in therapeutic was million in fiscal  a increase compared with million in the prior year period 
the increase in total revenue reflects a significant increase in research and development revenue associated with the surmodics pharmaceuticals acquisition in july surmodics pharmaceuticals contributed million and million in revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal results included surmodics pharmaceuticals for only two months  as the acquisition closed on july  cardiovascular derives a substantial amount of revenue from royalties and license fees and product sales attributable to cordis corporation  a johnson johnson company  on its cypher sirolimus eluting coronary stent 
the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics polymer coating that delivers a therapeutic drug designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 
cardiovascular revenue increased million  or  in fiscal  compared with the prior year period principally as a result of higher research and development revenue from customers 
overall royalties and license fees revenue increased despite an approximately decrease in our royalty revenue from cordis  which reflects the decrease in cypher stent sales 
ophthalmology revenue increased million  or  in fiscal  compared with the prior year period 
the significant increase principally reflects increased research and development revenue from various ophthalmology customers 
ophthalmology revenue  excluding the amortization of merck revenue in fiscal and  was million and million  respectively 

table of contents other markets revenue increased million  or  in fiscal  compared with the prior year period 
higher research and development revenue and product sales were the main contributors to the increase 
other markets revenue is derived from more than customers 
diagnostic 
revenue in diagnostic was million in fiscal  an increase of compared with million in the prior year period 
the increase was mainly attributable to increased product sales  principally as a result of the addition of million of biofx products sold during the year as compared with biofx product sales of million in fiscal operating results of biofx have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since august  the product sales increase was substantially offset by a decrease in royalties and license fees 
in vitro technologies derives a significant percentage of its revenue from ge healthcare and abbott laboratories 
royalty revenue generated under our diagnostic format patent license agreement with abbott laboratories decreased in fiscal compared with the prior year 
royalty revenue from ge healthcare decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal as a result of the transition to a non exclusive license in january product costs 
product costs were million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
overall product margins averaged  compared with reported in fiscal the slight decrease in product margins reflects the mix of products sold in the period in particular  some of our microarray slides and surmodics pharmaceuticals polymer products carry lower margins than our reagent and stabilization products 
customer research and development expenses 
customer research and development customer r d expenses were million  an increase of million  or  compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the addition of surmodics pharmaceuticals 
fiscal amounts include surmodics pharmaceuticals for two months of operations following the acquisition 
customer r d margins were in fiscal  compared with in fiscal the increase in margins principally reflects the significant increase in research and development revenue as a result of the acquisition of surmodics pharmaceuticals 
other research and development expenses 
other research and development expenses other r d were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with fiscal the decrease was driven principally by lower labor and benefit costs in fiscal compared with the prior year period  partially offset by higher other r d expenses from surmodics pharmaceuticals and biofx 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the addition of surmodics pharmaceuticals and biofx to our operations and higher stock based compensation expenses associated with second quarter fiscal board of directors transitions 
purchased in process research and development 
in july  we acquired all of the assets of surmodics pharmaceuticals 
results in the fourth quarter of fiscal include an in process research and development charge of million related to the surmodics pharmaceuticals acquisition 
the fair value of the in process research and development was determined by management 
other income loss  net 
other loss was million in fiscal  compared with income of million in fiscal the fiscal loss primarily reflects a million impairment loss on our investment in octoplus nv  based on a significant decline in the stock price 
income from investments was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the decrease primarily reflects lower investment balances and lower yields generated from our investment portfolio  as well as the early repayment of a note receivable associated with the fiscal sale of our contract manufacturing facility located in bloomington  minnesota 
income tax expense 
the income tax provision was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was

the effective tax rate in fiscal was 
excluding the impact of the non tax deductible purchased in process research and development charges  the fiscal effective rate was 
the increase in the effective tax rate  adjusted for the one time items noted  reflects an increase in state tax contingency reserves in fiscal and a release of federal tax reserves in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had working capital of million  of which million consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
working capital decreased million from the september  level driven principally by lower cash  accounts receivable and income taxes receivable balances  offset by lower accrued compensation and deferred revenue balances 
deferred revenue balances have decreased as a result of the termination of the merck arrangement in fiscal in addition  accrued annual incentive compensation decreased because fiscal objectives were not achieved 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments totaled million at september   a decrease of million from million at september  the decrease was principally driven by redemptions which were used to finance investment in our new manufacturing facility in alabama  which totaled million and for our stock repurchase program  which totaled million 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
the company s policy requires that no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
the primary investment objective of the portfolio is to provide for the safety of principal and appropriate liquidity while meeting or exceeding a benchmark merrill lynch year government corporate index total rate of return

net income was higher in fiscal principally as a result of the recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with the merck agreement  which is a non cash item 
the merck termination also resulted in a reduction in deferred tax asset balances  which are non cash 
the decrease in cash from operations also reflects lower cypher stent royalties and abbott royalties in fiscal we conduct a significant majority of our operations at our eden prairie  minnesota headquarters and at our surmodics pharmaceuticals subsidiary located in birmingham  alabama 
in addition to our eden prairie and birmingham locations  we lease approximately  square feet of commercial office space in irvine  california  where our ophthalmology business unit conducts a portion of its operations  and approximately  square feet of office and warehouse space in eden prairie 
in december  we consolidated all of our eden prairie personnel into our owned facility as part of our reorganization efforts  and subsequently subleased our leased space in eden prairie to another company

the sellers are still eligible to receive up to million in additional consideration 
based in owings mills  maryland  biofx is a leading manufacturer of substrates  a critical component of diagnostic test kits used to detect and signal that a certain reaction has taken place 
the acquisition of biofx has broadened our product portfolio in the in vitro diagnostics market

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment policy requires investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
because of the credit criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
surmodics does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale and held to maturity securities as of september   but no material impact on the results of operations or cash flows 
management believes that a reasonable change in raw material prices would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows because the company s inventory exposure is not material 

table of contents although we conduct business in foreign countries  our international operations consist primarily of sales of reagent and stabilization chemicals 
additionally  all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to material foreign currency risk with respect to future costs or cash flows from our foreign sales 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
