critical accounting policies the following is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses alll is maintained at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired  as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio 
since arriving at an appropriate alll involves a high degree of management judgment  an ongoing quarterly analysis to develop a range of estimated losses is utilized 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  best estimates within the range of potential credit loss to determine the appropriate alll is utilized 
credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the alll 
the company utilizes an internal risk grading system for its loans 
those larger credits that exhibit probable or well defined credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
the borrower s cash flow  adequacy of collateral coverage  and other options available to the company  including legal remedies  are evaluated 
the review of individual loans includes those loans that are impaired as defined by sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for loss provision is considered 
historical loss rates are applied to other loans not subject to specific allocations 
the loss rates are determined from historical net charge offs experienced by the banks 
historical loss rates for commercial and retail loans are adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors that are considered include delinquency trends  current economic conditions and trends  strength of supervision and administration of the loan portfolio  levels of underperforming loans  level of recoveries to prior year s charge offs  trend in loan losses  industry concentrations and their relative strengths  amount of unsecured loans and underwriting exceptions 
these factors are reviewed quarterly and a weighted score is assigned depending on the level and extent of the risk 
the total of each of these weighted factors is then applied against the applicable portion of the portfolio and the alll is adjusted to ensure an appropriate level 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  under sfas  acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles are separately recognized if the benefit of the assets can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their useful lives 
any branch acquisition transactions were outside the scope of sfas and  accordingly  intangible assets related to such transactions continued to amortize upon the adoption of sfas the costs of purchased deposit relationships and other intangible assets  based on independent valuation by a qualified third party  are being amortized over their estimated lives 
core deposit intangible amortization expense charged to operations was  for the seven months ended december  the company did not record any goodwill or other intangible prior to the tfc and boe mergers 
mergers and acquisitions the company was organized under the laws of the state of delaware on april  as a targeted acquisition corporation sm or tac sm  it was formed to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business in the banking industry 
this strategy was successful with the business combinations completed on may  with transcommunity financial corporation and boe financial services of virginia  inc additionally  the company acquired from the fdic  as receiver  certain assets and liabilities of the community bank of loganville  georgia on november  and suburban federal savings bank on january  industry overview the banking industry faces a number of challenges in the current economic environment 
widespread problems in the area of mortgage lending have led to the downfall of certain government sponsored mortgage companies with a ripple effect throughout the financial sector 
companies are having a hard time maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity 
the need to increase reserves for loan losses in this uncertain climate  while prudent  has the effect of limiting or threatening profitability 
capital adequacy is more difficult to maintain because of the following decreased profitability reported throughout the industry  inability to supplement capital through markets  and downgraded credits  resulting in banks being required to maintain higher capital levels to sustain risk based capital ratios 
additionally  declining interest rates are compressing net interest margins 
to help spur the economy  the federal reserve decreased rates basis points since september  however  the anticipated effects of the rate cuts have not been broadly felt 
during this challenging time  management plans to focus on its asset quality  liquidity and the net interest margin 
while most of the banking industry news has been negative  management believes its conservative and proven banking practices will serve the company well during this economic downturn 
management believes that while banking prospects seem uncertain  the industry offers the opportunity for mergers or acquisitions and an attractive operating environment for target businesses 
further  management is aware of a number of distressed or failed depository institutions  and believes there will be more to follow 
management will consider these depository institutions as possible acquisition opportunities in a manner that is best for its shareholders 
according to statistics as of december   published by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  there are more than  commercial banks in the us with assets of to million  more than  of which have less than million in assets 
additionally  there were bank failures in the us in  and there have been through march  members of the company s management team and board of directors have experience in operating banks  negotiating and consummating merger and acquisition transactions as well as implementing and integrating such transactions with existing bank operations 
we intend to leverage the experience of our management team and our capital to create value for our shareholders 
strategy the company s strategy is to acquire or merge with commercial banks within the united states that have one or more of the following characteristics an opportunity for regional expansion and or the addition of new banking products and services  constraints on its capital and limited access to alternative capital markets due to its size or other special considerations  and a size which is generally too small to attract the interest of larger acquirers 
management believes the company s balance sheet  and in particular  its capital structure  can be utilized to further grow the existing banking institution 
growth opportunities may include some or all of the following expanding the branch network of an existing banking institution  utilizing capital to increase loans and deposits  attracting personnel from other banks who can bring substantial business with them  seeking other profitable business lines to add to the bank s core business  and seeking strategic acquisitions which can provide growth to the existing business or a platform to enter another geographic market 
business overview the following discussion is intended to assist readers in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries 
this section should be read in conjunction with company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report

the new branches in georgia and maryland operate under the name essex bank  divisions of the bank of essex 
as of december   the company had total assets of billion  an increase of million  or  from million at december  total loans aggregated million on december  and were on december  as further described in the note to the consolidated financial statements  the company acquired tfc and boe effective may  the company s securities portfolio increased million  from million at december   to million at december  the magnitude of the security growth was due to both the boe and tfc mergers  and the aforementioned purchase of certain assets and assumption of deposits of the community bank of loganville 
the large influx of cash related to tcb s deposits were invested in securities in an effort to maximize earnings  while loan growth remains stagnant due to credit conditions nationwide 
the company is required to account for the effect of market changes in the value of securities available for sale afs under sfas the market value of the december  securities afs portfolio was million 
at december   the company s net unrealized loss on afs securities was  total deposits at december  and december  were million and  respectively 
it is important to note that total deposits for the community bank aggregated million at december   or  of the company s total deposits 
the company had federal home loan bank fhlb advances aggregating million at december  and at december  stockholders equity at december  was million and represented of total assets 
stockholders equity was million  or of total assets at december  results of operations net income for reflects a full twelve months for the company and seven months of consolidated operations for the holding company and the banking subsidiary 
net income for is reflective of the nine month period from april  to december  the company changed accounting year ends in  thus resulting in the nine month operating period 
it is important to note that prior year comparisons should be viewed with realization of bank operations in versus no bank operating activity in net income for the year ended december  net income was million 
this compares with net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  basic earnings per share were for and for fully diluted earnings per share were for and for nonaccruing loans were million at december   or of total loans 
other real estate owned was  loans past due days or more and accruing interest were  at december  net charged off on loans were  in total non performing loans and other real estate owned equaled of total loans at december  net interest income the company s operating results depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  including securities and loans  and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared with million in  which was comprised solely of interest income on us treasury securities 
interest and fee income on loans equaled million at december  and represented the largest component of interest income  despite a relatively low volume of loans relative to deposits at december  total interest expense was primarily driven by deposit expense of million during the company s total loan to deposit ratio was december  and at december  this ratio was affected during the fourth quarter of by the tcb transaction which accounted for million of deposits at december  management expects securities income to become a greater source of net interest earnings in  as the excess deposits related to the tcb acquisition were invested  correspondingly 
the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis  defined as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for  while the net interest spread was 
the following table presents the total amount of average balances  interest income from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates

other overhead costs included other operating expenses of million  amortization of intangibles of  occupancy expenses of  equipment expense of  data processing fees of  and legal fees of  for the operating period 
during the fourth quarter of  the company consolidated its computer operating systems 
while this created economies of scale and increased capacity  there were significant installation  training and implementation costs 
income taxes income tax expense was  for the year ended december   compared with  for the same period in the reduced income tax provision as a percentage of taxable income was due in part to a net operating loss carry forward afforded by the former transcommunity financial corporation and by the addition of nontaxable interest income on bank qualified state  county  and municipal securities 
asset quality the company s asset quality remains sound 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount adequate to provide for potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company s management has established an allowance for loan losses which it believes is adequate for the risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
among other factors  management considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits and current and anticipated economic conditions 
there are additional risks of future loan losses  which cannot be precisely quantified nor attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because those risks include general economic trends  as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
the allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies 
the company maintains a list of loans that have potential weaknesses which may need special attention 
this nonperforming loan list is used to monitor such loans and is used in the determination of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
at december   nonperforming assets totaled million 
net charge offs were  for the year ended december  nationally  industry concerns over asset quality have increased due in large part to issues related to subprime mortgage lending  declining real estate activity and general economic concerns 
while the company has experienced reduced residential real estate activity  the markets in which the company operates remain relatively stable 
while the company incurred appropriate provisions for loan losses and thus an adequate level of allowance for loan losses  there has been no significant deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio 
residential loan demand has moderated somewhat  but the company is still experiencing continued loan demand  particularly in commercial real estate 
management will continue to monitor delinquencies  risk rating changes  charge offs  market trends and other indicators of risk in the company s portfolio  particularly those tied to residential real estate  and adjust the allowance for loan losses accordingly 
the following table sets forth selected asset quality data and ratios as of december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans loans days past due and accruing interest total nonperforming loans other real estate owned oreo total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets to total loans and oreo allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans see footnote to these financial statements for information related to the allowance for loan losses 
as of december   total impaired loans equaled million 
capital requirements the determination of capital adequacy depends upon a number of factors  such as asset quality  liquidity  earnings  growth trends and economic conditions 
the company seeks to maintain a strong capital base to support its growth and expansion plans  provide stability to current operations and promote public confidence in the company 
the federal banking regulators have defined three tests for assessing the capital strength and adequacy of banks  based on two definitions of capital 
tier capital is defined as a combination of common and qualifying preferred stockholders equity less goodwill 
tier capital is defined as qualifying subordinated debt and a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
total capital is defined as tier capital plus tier capital 
three risk based capital ratios are computed using the above capital definitions  total assets and risk weighted assets and are measured against regulatory minimums to ascertain adequacy 
all assets and off balance sheet risk items are grouped into categories according to degree of risk and assigned a risk weighting and the resulting total is risk weighted assets 
tier risk based capital is tier capital divided by risk weighted assets 
total risk based capital is total capital divided by risk weighted assets 
the leverage ratio is tier capital divided by total average assets 
the company s ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets was on december  the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was on december  the company s leverage ratio tier capital to average adjusted total assets was on december  these ratios exceed regulatory minimums 
in the fourth quarter of  boe issued trust preferred subordinated debt that qualifies as regulatory capital 
this trust preferred debt has a year maturity with a year call option and was issued at a rate of three month libor plus 
the weighted average cost of this instrument was during loans as of december   total loans outstanding were million  versus on december  nearly all of these loans were acquired through the mergers with both tfc and boe

securities the company invests funds in securities primarily to provide liquidity while earning income 
as of december   securities equaled million  an increase of million  or  compared with securities of million as of december  this increase was due to the acquisition of tfc and boe on may   which included their entire securities portfolios 
also  the purchase and assumption of tcb on november   resulted in a large influx of cash immediately available for investment in december nearly two thirds  or  of the securities portfolio  is classified available for sale  which equaled million at december  securities classified held to maturity totaled million  and the remaining million were equity securities concentrated in restricted stock held with the federal reserve bank  fhlb  and community bankers bank

liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  and certain investment securities 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
the company s results of operations are significantly affected by its ability to manage effectively the interest rate sensitivity and maturity of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the adequacy of the company s capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis with reference to size  composition  and quality of the company s balance sheet 
moreover  capital levels are regulated and compared with industry standards 
management seeks to maintain a capital level exceeding regulatory statutes of well capitalized which is consistent to its overall growth plans  yet allows the company to provide the optimal return to its shareholders

commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each client s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing clients 
those lines of credit may be drawn upon only to the total extent to which the bank is committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to clients 
the bank holds certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the corporation s asset and liability management committee alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk 
the board of directors reviews and approves the guidelines established by alco 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of two complimentary modeling tools earnings simulation modeling and economic value simulation net present value estimation 
each of these models measures changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios 
while each of the interest rate risk measures has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
earnings simulation and economic value models  which more effectively measure the cash flow and optionality impacts  are utilized by management on a regular basis and are explained below 
earnings simulation analysis management uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that management has input  but it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other potential analyses 
assumptions used in the model are derived from historical trends and management s outlook and include loan and deposit growth rates and projected yields and rates 
such assumptions are monitored and periodically adjusted as appropriate 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are reflected in the different rate scenarios 
the corporation uses its simulation model to estimate earnings in rate environments where rates ramp up or down around a most likely rate scenario  based on implied forward rates 
the analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month time horizon by applying month shock versus the implied forward rates of basis points up and down 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on net interest income for the corporation across the rate paths modeled as of december  change in net interest income percent dollars in thousands change in yield curve bp bp most likely bp bp
