table of contents overview bemis company  inc is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets 
generally about percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry 
sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices  personal care  and lawn and garden 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment  which accounts for about percent of our net sales 
the remaining percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets 
the markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive 
our leading flexible packaging market positions in north and south america reflect our focus on expanding our offering of value added  proprietary products 
we also manufacture products that are less unique but for which our technical know how and economies of scale offer us a competitive advantage 
the primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins  films  paper  ink  and adhesives 
market conditions during  economic conditions continued to weaken and global financial markets experienced a significant liquidity crisis 
governments around the world have responded to the financial crisis with funding support for their regional financial systems 
consumer spending declined and unemployment in the united states increased 
the housing and automotive markets continue to be weak 
commodity prices hit historically high levels during the second and third quarters of  resulting in increased raw material and energy costs for manufacturers 
some of the commodity grade raw material costs steadily decreased throughout the fourth quarter as the global financial crisis widened 
our raw material costs hit historic highs during the year  but by the end of the year certain material costs had declined to early levels 
while lower raw material costs benefit operating profit on a short term basis  our selling prices will decrease to reflect these lower costs over a few months 
restructuring and related charges in january  we announced the planned closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency 
these efforts were substantially complete as of december  total remaining costs incurred in were substantially offset by restructuring related gains 
restructuring and related charges incurred in totaled million  of which million primarily reflected accelerated depreciation and was recorded as a component of cost of products sold 
the remaining million primarily reflected employee related costs and was recorded as a component of other costs income 
acquisitions in april  we acquired the remaining shares of our three majority owned joint ventures in mexico for million 
results of operations consolidated overview in millions  except per share amounts net sales net income diluted earnings per share versus for the year ended december   net sales increased percent  reflecting increased raw material costs incorporated into higher selling prices during the year 
unit volume sold into certain food packaging markets increased compared to  while unit volumes declined in advertising  display film  and construction related markets that are more sensitive to economic conditions 
currency translation benefits increased net sales by percent 
diluted earnings per share were for  a percent decrease compared to per share for in  diluted earnings per share included per share tax benefit related to dividends from foreign subsidiaries 
higher raw material costs in negatively impacted gross margins 
versus for the year ended december   net sales increased percent  reflecting a net sales benefit from currency translation of percent  offset by a percent decrease in net sales related to lower unit sales volume 
diluted earnings per share were for  including a per share tax benefit related to dividends from foreign subsidiaries 
in  diluted earnings per share were for  including per share of restructuring and related charges 
flexible packaging business segment our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets  including meat and cheese  confectionery and snack  frozen foods  lawn and garden  health and hygiene  beverages  medical devices  bakery  and dry foods 
the most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins  which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products 
selling price changes lag behind changes in our raw material costs 
during  resin costs dramatically increased during the second and third quarters 
certain commodity resin costs subsequently decreased during the fourth quarter 
the magnitude and frequency of these cost changes negatively impacted operating profit during 
table of contents in january of  we announced a restructuring plan to close five flexible packaging plants in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency throughout this business segment 
these efforts were substantially completed by december  restructuring and related charges for the flexible packaging business segment totaled million in dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus net sales in our flexible packaging business segment increased percent in  principally reflecting the impact of higher selling prices 
currency effects accounted for sales growth of percent during increases in net sales of packaging for meat and cheese  dairy and liquids  bakery products  and medical products markets reflected higher unit volume 
these markets represent approximately percent of total flexible packaging net sales 
net sales also increased in packaging for dry foods  health and hygiene  and industrial product markets  driven primarily by higher selling prices 
these markets represent approximately percent of flexible packaging net sales 
we experienced lower net sales in the remaining percent of our flexible packaging market categories as a result of lower unit volume 
these lower volume markets include confectionery and snack markets  pet products  overwrap film for bottled water  frozen foods  lawn and garden  and protective display films 
non discretionary food markets have historically provided defensive characteristics during times of economic weakness 
markets for protective display films and packaging for discretionary food and consumer products have been negatively impacted during the recent economic downturn 
we expect these trends to continue until the economy begins to strengthen and consumer confidence improves 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent in from percent in restructuring and related activities increased operating income by million 
raw material prices increased substantially during the first eight months of  and many specialty materials used in our food packaging products maintained those prices through the end of the year 
our method of passing these input costs on to customers through increased selling prices normally occurs with a several month lag and pressures operating profit margins during that period 
versus net sales in our flexible packaging business segment were virtually unchanged from to a benefit from currency translation of percent was completely offset by weak demand across many of our packaging markets 
net sales of packaging for meat and cheese  which represent about percent of our flexible packaging net sales  decreased about percent excluding the impact of currency 
packaging for bakery products and dry foods  for which consumer demand has been impacted by increased wheat prices  experienced a drop in net sales of about percent from levels 
packaging for pet products and industrial products also decreased over percent in packaging for bakery  dry foods  pet products  and industrial products represents about percent of flexible packaging net sales 
growth in other flexible packaging markets representing a combined percent of total flexible packaging net sales substantially offset the impact of these decreases 
packaging for dairy and liquid products and overwrap for bottled beverages each increased by about percent 
net sales of medical device packaging increased almost percent compared to  despite a slowdown related to a period of manufacturing shutdown during in order to move equipment to a new facility in northern ireland 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to percent in from percent in restructuring and related activities resulted in million of operating income in and a million reduction in operating profit in during  operating profit was negatively impacted by the lower unit sales volume noted in the previous paragraph and a steady increase in raw material costs 
pressure sensitive materials business segment the pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets prime and variable information labels  which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets  graphic design  used to create signage and decorations  and technical components  which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics  automotive  construction and medical industries 
paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment 
for the last several years  general economic conditions and competitive pressures have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs 
in january of  we announced a restructuring plan which included the closure of one pressure sensitive materials plant in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency 
this effort was completed by december  restructuring and related charges incurred for this business segment totaled million in these costs were primarily employee related costs and were recorded as a component of other costs income  net 
dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales 
table of contents versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales decrease of percent in  reflecting a benefit from currency translation of percent which was more than offset by lower unit sales 
unit volumes declined in each of our pressure sensitive product lines  partially offset by increased label products prices and improved sales mix for technical products 
our label and graphic product lines represent percent of our pressure sensitive materials net sales 
demand for these products in the discretionary consumer and advertising markets declined during the recent global economic downturn 
operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in compared to  reflecting decreased unit sales volumes across all product lines 
due to the nature of the markets served by this business segment  we expect operating profit as a percent of net sales to continue to decline until global economic conditions improve 
versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of percent in  reflecting a benefit from currency translation of percent  substantially offset by lower unit sales for label and technical products 
increased industry capacity for label products dampened unit sales volume and pricing during  resulting in a percent decrease in net sales of label products  excluding the impact of currency 
technical product net sales decreased by over percent as customers faced economic challenges associated with the housing and medical markets 
graphic product net sales increased by about percent during operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in compared to  reflecting decreased sales of value added technical products and a lower margin sales mix in our graphic product sales 
consolidated gross margin dollars in millions gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by million in and million in there were no restructuring charges during the time lag between increases in raw material costs and the implementation of related selling price increases negatively impacted gross margins as a percent of net sales in each of the years presented 
in addition  lower production volume associated with weak consumer demand for products in our markets reduced fixed cost absorption during and the impact of these cost pressures was partially offset by ongoing initiatives to improve production efficiency and cost management during the same timeframe 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses have remained relatively stable over the past few years  reflecting management s focus on cost management 
the decline in the ratio of these expenses to net sales was driven by higher selling prices included in net sales over these time periods 
other expenses dollars in millions research and development r d r d as a percentage of net sales interest expense other costs income  net minority interest in net income income taxes effective tax rate research and development our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness  and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million during  reflecting lower levels of debt outstanding and lower average interest rates 
the percentage of variable rate debt included in total debt is percent in  percent in  and percent in the effective interest rate was percent in  percent in  and percent in 
table of contents other costs income  net in  other costs income included million of financial income  about percent of which relates to interest income on cash held at non us locations 
the use of cash on hand for debt reduction during the fourth quarter of is expected to result in lower interest income during the remainder of the financial income is generated from fiscal incentives for certain flexible packaging locations and is considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit 
these fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in south america and are expected to continue to grow at a modest pace over the next few years in conjunction with sales growth in that region 
transaction losses on foreign currency totaling million offset financial income in of this total  million of transaction losses were recorded during the fourth quarter as dramatic changes in currency exchange rates occurred as a result of the global financial crisis 
in  other costs income included million of financial income  about half of which related to interest income on cash held at non us locations 
in  other costs income included million of restructuring and related charges  which were more than offset by financial income of million and a million favorable resolution of a litigated foreign excise tax liability 
minority interest in net income minority interest in net income is primarily associated with the accounting for the outstanding preferred shares of dixie toga  our brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary 
income taxes the difference between our overall tax rate of percent in  percent in  and percent in and the us statutory rate of percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits 
the lower effective tax rates in and as compared to reflect benefits related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary  the increasing impact of us tax incentives for manufacturing companies  and a change in the geographic mix of pretax income 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity in the second half of  global financial markets experienced a liquidity crisis 
this crisis resulted in a substantial reduction in available funding for commercial banks and corporate debt issuers 
governments around the world have responded with funding support for their regional financial systems 
despite this government intervention  capital market financing has become less available and more expensive 
we use commercial paper to finance our daily operations 
our strong balance sheet and short term a p credit ratings have preserved our ability to access the commercial paper market at a reasonable cost 
if the commercial paper market becomes unavailable to us  we would expect to use our revolving bank credit facilities to finance our operations until the commercial paper market is restored or alternative financing can be arranged 
debt to total capitalization debt to total capitalization which includes total debt  long term deferred tax liabilities and equity was percent at december   compared to percent at december  and percent at december  improvement in this ratio was driven by debt repayments  partially offset by reductions to stockholders equity for pension and currency translation effects 
total debt was million  million  and million at year end  and  respectively 
credit rating our capital structure and financial practices have earned bemis company long term credit ratings of a from standard poor s and baa from moody s investors service  and a credit rating of a and prime for our commercial paper program from standard poor s and moody s investor service  respectively 
these credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest 
net cash flow from operations net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in during  cash flow was negatively impacted by lower operating profit and higher levels of working capital compared to working capital increases during reflect the impact of higher raw material costs on inventory and increased selling prices on accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operations in the year ended december   was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our us pension plans of million 
contributions of million and million were made to our us pension plans in and  respectively 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our us pension plans in we expect to fund this contribution with cash provided by operations 
available financing in addition to using cash provided by operations  we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs 
at year end  our commercial paper debt outstanding was million 
based upon our current credit rating  we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets 
during the fourth quarter of  the global financial crisis threatened to eliminate liquidity in the commercial paper market 
while not anticipated  if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper  we would draw upon our existing back up credit facility 
under the terms of our revolving credit agreements  we have the capacity to borrow up to million  of which million matures april   and million matures april  these facilities are primarily used to support our issuance of commercial paper 
our revolving credit facilities are supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by these revolving credit facilities include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
the revolving credit agreements include a combined million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries 
in addition  we have arrangements in place to issue up to million of extendable commercial notes ecns  which are short term instruments whose 
table of contents maturity can be extended to days from the date of issuance 
as of december   the ecn market was unavailable due to unfavorable market conditions 
if these revolving credit facilities and ecns were no longer available to us  we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing costs 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate 
commercial paper outstanding at december   has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
the related back up credit agreement expires on april  on august   notes totaling million matured and were repaid using proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper 
on december   our revolving credit facilities supported total commercial paper outstanding of million  industrial revenue bond outstanding of million  and multicurrency loans outstanding of million 
as a result  we had the capacity to borrow an additional million under the credit facility as of december  of this available liquidity  million of revolving credit facilities mature on april  while cash flows from operations are expected to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our cash obligations projected for  we will continue to evaluate the need to refinance this excess revolving credit capacity in light of existing capital market conditions and updated liquidity needs 
liquidity outlook management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward 
our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment or the recent economic slowdown  and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by ongoing capital market disruptions 
in addition  substantial increases in raw material costs could increase our short term liquidity needs 
uses of liquidity capital expenditures capital expenditures were million during  compared to million in  and million in capital expenditures during the years presented supported multiyear investments for new facilities and equipment for the medical and pharmaceutical markets  a platform for rigid polyester packaging products  additional converting equipment in our malaysian operation  proprietary film production capacity for european markets  and a new enterprise resource planning system 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million 
over the long term  we expect average annual capital expenditures to be approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities 
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to cents per share from cents per share 
this follows increases of percent in and percent in in february  the board of directors approved the th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to cents per share  a percent increase 
share repurchases during  we purchased million shares of common stock in the open market 
during  we purchased million shares of common stock  of which million shares were repurchased in conjunction with an accelerated share repurchase program 
the remaining million shares were purchased in the open market 
during  we purchased million shares of common stock in the open market 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to million additional shares of common stock for the treasury 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations  and certain other purchase obligations as of december  contractual payments due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years debt payments interest expense capital leases operating leases purchase obligations postretirement obligations pursuant to the application of fin  the company has accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
these liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on april  a portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates 
the amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at december  
table of contents amount noted also includes estimated interest costs 
the present value of these obligations  excluding interest  is included on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded bemis supplemental retirement plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations 
interest rate swaps as of december   our long term unsecured notes included million due in august in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with two us banks  which increased our exposure to variable rates 
we generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term 
these interest rate swap agreements  which expired on the date the related notes matured in august  reduced the interest cost of the notes from percent to about percent in and percent in since these variable rates are based upon six month london interbank offered rates libor  calculated in arrears  at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap require that the fair value of these swaps  which were designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding  be recorded as an asset or liability of the company 
the fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of million at december  an offsetting increase was recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding 
this fair value adjustment did not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes  nor did it impact the income statement or related cash flows 
market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates  establish rates for future issuance of public notes  and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
interest expense on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of variable rate debt outstanding would increase by million 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
the net settlement amount fair value related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs income  net  which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
our business in brazil holds us dollar denominated debt which creates exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the brazilian real 
in order to hedge this exposure  we enter into currency swaps with maturities that match the underlying debt  effectively converting a portion of the us denominated debt to the local currency 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
at december  and  we had outstanding currency swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
the net settlement amounts fair value related to active swap contracts is recorded on the balance sheet as part of the underlying debt and as an expense element of other costs income  net  which offsets the related transaction gains or losses and were not significant at december  and the operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of million in and million in operating profit improved by approximately million in and million in as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation 
stockholders equity includes adjustments to other comprehensive income for changes in currency translation for consolidated balance sheet accounts 
the impact of currency translation during was a reduction in stockholders equity totaling million 

table of contents the majority of our pension liabilities are funded with assets that are invested in equity and fixed income securities whose market values are readily available from published market sources 
during  the market value of these assets declined in conjunction with the global economic downturn 
this decline in market value is the principal reason that pension expense in is expected to increase by approximately million 
as of december   the unfunded portion of our pension liabilities increased by million compared to the balance as of december  the after tax impact of this increased liability is a charge to other comprehensive income of million  which is reflected as reduction in stockholders equity at december  critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
accounting for pension costs we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended by fas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
fas no 
requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
net periodic pension costs recorded in was million  compared to pension cost of million in and million in effective january   our us defined benefit pension plans were amended for approximately two thirds of the participant population 
for those employees impacted  future pension benefits were replaced with a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the company 
as a result  future pension liability is no longer adjusted for additional years of service for those employees impacted by the amendment and the related service cost and pension expense have decreased 
one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets 
as of january   in conjunction with a change in the allocation of the us pension assets to equity investments from percent to percent of total assets  we reduced our expected long term rate of return on plan assets to percent 
for the years and  we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of percent of total assets and had assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be percent 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation 
using historical long term investment periods of   and years ending december   our pension plan assets have earned annualized rates of return of percent  percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
this is a substantial decline from the annualized long term investment returns as of december  of percent  percent  percent and percent 
this decline reflects substantially lower investment market values on us pension assets during considering these long term results  we further reduced our expected return on assets assumption to percent as of january  using our target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of one quarter of one percent from the percent rate used at december  
table of contents pension assumptions sensitivity analysis based upon current assumptions of percent for the discount rate and percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for to be in a range of million to million 
the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
total increase decrease total increase decrease to pension expense to pension expense dollars in millions from current assumptions from current assumptions discount rate rate of return on plan assets percent percent percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent current assumption percent percent percent percent percent percent in accordance with fas no 
 the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset  in the case of an overfunded plan  or as a liability  in the case of an underfunded plan 
the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate 
total increase decrease in accumulated other comprehensive dollars in millions income  net of taxes  from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  condition and amounts of future cash flows
