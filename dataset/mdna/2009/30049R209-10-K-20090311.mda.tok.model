critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from two primary sources license fees and services and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
in addition we have applied staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which provides further interpretive guidance for public companies on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the majority of our license fees and services revenue is generated from fixed price contracts which provide for licenses to our software products and services 
generally  when the services are determined to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting  in accordance with sop and sop  accounting for long term construction type contracts 
we estimate the percentage of completion for each contract based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to total estimated direct labor hours 
since estimated direct labor hours and project costs  and changes thereto  can have a significant impact on revenue recognition  these estimates are critical and are reviewed by management regularly 
we record amounts billed in advance of services being performed as unearned revenue 
unbilled work in progress represents revenue earned but not yet billable under the terms of the fixed price contracts 
all such amounts are expected to be billed and collected within months 
we may encounter budget and schedule overruns on fixed price contracts caused by increased labor  overhead or material costs 
we make adjustments to cost estimates in the periods in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
we record estimated losses  if any  in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
in arrangements where the services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software  we recognize license revenue when a license agreement has been signed  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
where applicable  we unbundle and record as revenue fees from multiple element arrangements as the elements are delivered to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements exist 
if vsoe for the undelivered elements does not exist  we defer fees from such arrangements until the earlier of the date that vsoe does exist on the undelivered elements or all of the elements have been delivered 
we generally recognize services revenue provided under fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method described above 
we generally recognize revenue from professional services provided pursuant to time and materials contracts and training services as the services are performed  as that is when our obligation to our customers under such arrangements is fulfilled 
we generally recognize customer support and maintenance revenue ratably over the service contract period 
when maintenance or training services are bundled with the original license fee arrangement  their fair value  based upon vsoe  is deferred and recognized during the periods such services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments related to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for receivables when their collection becomes doubtful by recording an expense 
generally  we determine the allowance based on our assessment of the realization of receivables using historical information and current economic trends  including assessing the probability of collection from 
table of contents customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments owed to us  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be required 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance regularly and make adjustments accordingly 
adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts could materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income projections  historical results and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
however  adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is less or greater than the amount that we recorded 
such adjustments  if any  could have a material impact on our results of our operations 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
there was no material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations as a result of the adoption of the provisions of fin on january   we recorded a fin transition adjustment consisting of a million decrease in our deferred tax assets related to research and development tax credits that was offset by a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance 
as of december   we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not believe there will be any material changes to our unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators may include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
for purposes of the goodwill evaluation  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying amount 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  we would then compare the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount  and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment of goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
intangible assets we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill 
we amortize certain intangible assets over their estimated lives  while in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge to product development expense in the statements of operations on the acquisition date 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and or our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition and compare that to the asset s carrying amount 
any impairment loss recognized would represent the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
significant estimates and judgments are required when estimating such fair values 
if we determine that the intangibles are impaired  we will record an impairment charge and the amount could be material 
we recorded an impairment of intangible assets during the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

table of contents capitalization of internal software development costs we expend amounts on research and development  particularly for new products and or for enhancements of existing products 
for internal development of software products that are to be licensed by us  we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
sfas requires that the cost of developing software be expensed prior to establishing technological feasibility and those costs be capitalized once technological feasibility has been established 
capitalization ceases upon general release of the software 
the determination of whether internal software development costs are subject to capitalization is  by its nature  highly subjective and involves significant judgments 
this decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period 
further  once capitalized  the software costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the product 
the determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental 
finally  capitalized software costs must be assessed for impairment if facts and circumstances warrant such a review 
we did not capitalize any internal software development costs during the years ended december    or in addition  we did not have any capitalized internal software development costs included in our december  and consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that during these periods no material internal software development costs were required to be capitalized 
our conclusion is primarily based on the fact that the feature rich  pre integrated  and highly scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design  coding and testing methodologies  which include next generation software languages and development tools 
development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk 
substantially all of our internal software development efforts are of this nature  and therefore  we believe the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general release of the software to operations is so short that any costs incurred during this period are not material 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r effective january  this statement replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and superseded apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the modified prospective method of adoption  we are required to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and record compensation cost for all stock awards granted after january  and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
in addition  we are required to record compensation costs associated with the vesting of unvested options outstanding at january  using the guidance under sfas from january   we accounted for stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases under sfas r 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant 
this model requires the use of estimates for expected term of the options and expected volatility of the price of our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  share based payment sab  which amends staff accounting bulleting sab  share based payment  to permit public companies  under certain circumstances  to use the simplified method of sab for employee option grants after december  use of the simplified method after december  is permitted only for companies whose historical data about their employees exercise behavior does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term of the options 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate expected term for employee option grants as adequate historical experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate 
sab is effective for employee options granted after december  we adopted sab effective january  and continue applying the simplified method until adequate historical experience is readily available to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term for employee option grants 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specific election dates the fair value option 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected shall be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting period 
this accounting standard was effective for us beginning january  we have elected not to apply the fair value option allowed under sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued staff position no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for 
table of contents non financial assets and liabilities until financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
uncertainties that are either non financial or non quantifiable such as political  economic  tax  other regulatory  or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of market risks 
our cash balances are subject to interest rate fluctuations and as a result  interest income amounts may fluctuate from current levels 
we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our new senior revolving credit facilities entered into in february these obligations are variable interest rate facilities based on prime rate 
fluctuations in prime rate affect our interest rate risk 
we currently have no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities  but future borrowings will subject us to interest rate risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations of the us dollar our functional currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries 
any increase decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause the parent company to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses gains with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies 
in addition  we and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies  such as revenues and related accounts receivable including intercompany amounts that are denominated in a currency other than their own functional currency 
changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized based upon period end exchange rates or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries monetary assets and liabilities and the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
we record cumulative translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of equity 
as a result of foreign currency risk  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the relationship between the british pound sterling  indian rupee and the us dollar  which is our functional currency  is shown below  per one us dollar december  spot rates british pound sterling indian rupee for the years ended december  average rates british pound sterling indian rupee at the present time  we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure or use derivative financial instruments that are designed to reduce our long term exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we continually monitor our foreign currency exchange risk and we may consider various options to reduce this risk in the future
