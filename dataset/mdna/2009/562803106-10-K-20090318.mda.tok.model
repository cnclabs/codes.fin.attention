critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company applies the provisions of the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no

in general  the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists  ii delivery of the product has occurred  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
interest income from short and long term loans are recognized  as earned  over the note period

the company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
during the year ended december   the company wrote off its goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition of shopila 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

recent technical accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb simultaneously issued sfas no 
r  business combinations amendment  and sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb both standards update united states guidance on accounting for noncontrolling interests  sometimes referred to as minority interests  which interests represent a portion of a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb have been working together to promote international convergence of accounting standards 
prior to promulgation of these new standards there were specific areas in accounting for business acquisitions in which conversion was not achieved 
the objective of both standards is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in business combinations and consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards 
in business combinations it is accomplished by establishing principles and requirements concerning how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  as well as goodwill acquired in the combination or gain from a bargain purchase  and determines information to be disclosed to enable users to evaluate the nature and effects of business combinations 
in consolidated financial statements the standards require identification of ownership interests held in subsidiaries by parties other than the parent be clearly identified  labeled and presented in consolidated financial position within equity rather than mezzanine between liabilities and equity separately from amounts attributed to the parent  with net income attributable to the parent and to the minority interest clearly identified and presented on the face of consolidated statements of income 
the standards also provide guidance in situations where the parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary changes while the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
the standard also provides guidance on recording a gain or loss based on fair value in situations involving deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
entities must provide sufficient disclosures that distinguish between interests of the parent and that of the noncontrolling interest 
both standards are effective for fiscal years and interims beginning on or after december  that is january  for entities with calendar years 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the standards shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the company believes that the adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas amends sfas and changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
the company believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
fsp apb requires recognition of both the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features 
the debt component is required to be recognized at the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have an associated equity component 
the equity component is recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability 
fsp apb also requires an accretion of the resulting debt discount over the expected life of the debt 
this fsp shall be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
the company believes that the adoption of fsp apb will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
this standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for non governmental entities 
sfas is effective days following approval by the us securities and exchange commission sec of the public company accounting oversight board s amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
management does not believe that any other recently issued  but not yet effected  accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements
