the following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and under the headings risk factors and forward looking statements 
overview covidien ltd 
was incorporated in bermuda in as a wholly owned subsidiary of tyco international ltd  however  covidien did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets until june  as part of a plan to separate tyco international into three independent companies  tyco international transferred the equity interests of the entities that held all of the assets and liabilities of its healthcare businesses to covidien and  on june   distributed all of its shares of covidien to tyco international shareholders 
our financial results reflect the consolidated operations of covidien as an independent publicly traded company following june   and a combined reporting entity comprised of the assets and liabilities used in managing tyco international ltd 
s healthcare businesses  including covidien  prior to and including june  our financial statements have been prepared in us dollars  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for the first nine months of fiscal  prior to the separation  certain general corporate overhead  other expenses  debt and related net interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt have been allocated to us by tyco international 
management believes such allocations are reasonable  however  they may not be indicative of the actual expenses we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent  publicly traded company 
note to our financial statements provides additional information regarding allocated expenses 
recent developments reorganization in december  our board of directors approved moving our principal executive office from bermuda to ireland 
on may   shareholders voted in favor of a reorganization proposal pursuant to which all covidien ltd 
common shares would be cancelled and all holders of such shares would receive ordinary shares of covidien plc on a one to one basis 
the reorganization transaction was completed on june   following approval from the supreme court of bermuda  at which time covidien plc replaced covidien ltd 
as the ultimate parent company 
shares of the irish company  covidien plc  began trading on the new york stock exchange on june  under the symbol cov  the same symbol under which covidien ltd 
shares were previously traded 
change in segment reporting structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made a number of segment reporting changes to align external reporting with recent changes to our internal reporting structure 
we combined our pharmaceutical products and imaging solutions segments into a single operating segment called pharmaceuticals 
our pharmaceutical and imaging products businesses both face similar challenges including a lengthy product development cycle and extensive regulation by various agencies  such as the fda 
integrating the management of these businesses further allows us to better utilize internal resources and achieve cost synergies 
in addition  we reclassified our sharpsafety and clinical care product lines in the united states and europe from our medical devices segment to our medical supplies segment  consistent with where management now responsible for their oversight are located 
subsequent to the acquisition of vnus  we determined that the marketing strategies and sales call points associated with these products are better aligned with the businesses within our medical supplies segment 
finally  we reclassified several hernia mechanical devices from our endomechanical instruments product line to our soft tissue repair product line  both within the medical 
table of contents devices segment  and made several other less significant transfers between product lines and segments 
following these changes  we manage and operate our business through the following three segments medical devices includes the development  manufacture and sale of endomechanical instruments  soft tissue repair products  energy devices  oximetry and monitoring products  airway and ventilation products  vascular products and other medical products 
pharmaceuticals includes the development  manufacture and distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals  active pharmaceutical ingredients  specialty chemicals  contrast products and radiopharmaceuticals 
medical supplies includes the development  manufacture and sale of nursing care products  medical surgical products  sharpsafety products and original equipment manufacturer products oem 
all periods have been restated for the changes to our segment reporting structure discussed above

both of these businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and  accordingly  have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see discontinued operations for further information 
covidien business factors influencing the results of operations sales and marketing investment selling and marketing expenses increased million in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount and related compensation programs 
the increase in headcount was to support our geographic expansion and increased focus on selling to and supporting customers directly rather than through distributors 
selling and marketing expenses in fiscal were level compared with fiscal as planned increases were offset by currency gains 
in fiscal  our focus will shift from investing in sales and marketing to leveraging the previous investments that we have made

as of the date of acquisition  this technology was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use 
design  testing  clinical trials and regulatory submission are required in order to bring the project to completion 
if the device receives regulatory approval  we anticipate that it will occur in fiscal and be released to the market shortly thereafter 
management determined the valuation of the in process research and development using  among other factors  appraisals 
the value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method and was discounted at a rate  which was considered commensurate with the project s risks and stage of development 
future residual cash flows that could be generated from the project were determined based upon management s estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the project and technology involved 
these projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account management s estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the project to completion 
we can not assure that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will prove to be accurate or that the timely completion of the project to commercial success will occur 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties associated with research and development projects

the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal was also due to the write off of a previously recognized million deferred tax asset related to our specialty chemicals business and million of incremental net shareholder settlement charges and million of incremental in process research and development charges  for which no tax benefit was recorded 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to charges incurred in fiscal related to the net class action settlement and allocated loss on early extinguishment of debt  for which no tax benefit was realized 
in addition  the rate in fiscal was favorably impacted by the settlement of certain income tax matters and adjustments to income tax liabilities pre dating the separation 
these decreases in the fiscal tax rate were partially offset by increased interest costs incurred in connection with the adoption of the provisions that clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes discussed in other income expense  net  changes in certain non us tax laws and the expiration of the us research and development tax credit as of december  discontinued operations during fiscal  we sold our retail products segment and our european incontinence products business within the medical supplies segment because their products and customer bases were not aligned with our long term strategic objectives 

table of contents retail products segment during fiscal  we sold our retail products segment for gross cash proceeds of million  subject to working capital adjustments 
deal costs and other adjustments resulted in net cash proceeds of million  which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  we recorded a million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to our retail products segment  which included charges totaling million recorded during the first six months of fiscal  to write down the business to its fair value less cost to sell 
fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on the sale agreement 
the loss on sale was adjusted in fiscal because of the receipt of contingent payments and net proceeds from the sale of a retail products facility totaling million 
during fiscal  we performed an asset impairment analysis and determined that the book value of the retail products segment was in excess of its estimated fair value 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million associated with our former retail products segment  which is included in loss on sale of discontinued operations 
the estimated fair value of the retail products segment was evaluated based on discounted expected future cash flows of the related assets and reflected the adverse trends in raw material and energy costs  and a higher discount rate to represent market conditions existing at the time 
european incontinence business during fiscal  we also sold our european incontinence business 
as a condition of the sale  we were required to contribute cash of million into the business prior to the closing of the transaction 
during fiscal  we recorded a million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to our european incontinence business  which includes charges totaling million recorded during the first six months of fiscal  to write down the business to its fair value less costs to sell 
fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on the sale agreement 
change in plan of sale during fiscal  we decided to sell our specialty chemical business within the pharmaceuticals segment because its products and customer base were not aligned with our long term strategic objectives 
the specialty chemicals business had been classified as held for sale and the results of its activities reflected within discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we ceased efforts to market this business given market conditions existing at the time 
as a result  the specialty chemicals business no longer met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and  accordingly  was reclassified from held for sale to held and used and from discontinued operations to continuing operations for all periods presented 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense relating to the period from the first quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal when the specialty chemicals business was classified as held for sale 
in addition  as discussed under income tax expense we recorded a charge of million for the write off of a previously recognized deferred tax asset resulting from the reclassification of this business to continuing operations 
liquidity and capital resources our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets 
we believe  however  that our cash balances and other sources of liquidity  primarily our committed credit facility  will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in growth opportunities and fund operations for the foreseeable future 
fiscal cash flow activity the net cash provided by continuing operating activities of billion was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal  as adjusted for depreciation and amortization  the change in related party receivable on the tax sharing agreement discussed in other income expense  net  in process research and development charges and an increase in working capital of million driven primarily by accrued and other liabilities and income taxes payable 
the increase in accrued and other liabilities includes million related to estimated environmental remediation costs and million relating to an anti trust legal settlement 
a majority of the 
table of contents increase in income taxes relates to our portion of tyco international s settlement with the irs of certain outstanding tax matters within the through audit cycle 
during fiscal  we paid million for our portion of tyco international s settlements with certain shareholders 
in addition  we paid million for us and us income taxes and withholding tax on earnings that were either repatriated or undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in certain subsidiaries 
the net cash used in continuing investing activities of billion was primarily due to acquisition related payments of million  primarily associated with the acquisition of vnus  and capital expenditures of million 
the net cash used in continuing financing activities of million was primarily the result of dividend payments of million and repurchases of shares totaling million discussed under share repurchases 
fiscal cash flow activity the net cash provided by continuing operating activities of million was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations for fiscal  as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and the change in related party receivable on the tax sharing agreement discussed in other income expense  net 
an increase in accrued and other liabilities of million  a significant portion of which relates to accrued interest  also contributed to cash provided by continuing operating activities 
these amounts were partially offset by the finalization of tyco international s class action settlement of billion  an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the finalization of the class action settlement did not affect our cash balance  however  as the funds had previously been set aside in an escrow account during fiscal the net cash provided by continuing investing activities of million was primarily due to the release of our interest in tyco international s class action settlement fund of billion and million in net proceeds from the divestitures  primarily related to our retail products segment and european incontinence business 
these amounts were partially offset by capital expenditures of million and acquisition activity of million  primarily related to the acquisitions of tsl and scandius 
the net cash used in continuing financing activities of billion was primarily the result of the repayment of debt of billion  primarily associated with borrowings under our bridge loan facility and dividend payments of million 
these payments were largely offset by the issuance of debt of billion  net proceeds from commercial paper of million and proceeds from option exercises of million 
fiscal cash flow activity the net cash provided by continuing operating activities of billion was primarily attributable to loss from continuing operations for fiscal  as adjusted for the net class action settlement charge  depreciation and amortization  loss on early extinguishment of debt and an increase in accrued and other liabilities of million  primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation 
the net cash used in continuing investing activities of billion was primarily due to our interest in the class action settlement fund of billion  capital expenditures of million and acquisition activity of million  primarily related to the acquisition of airox for million and the acquisition of intellectual property from sorbx for million 
acquisition activity also included million of cash paid relating to holdback liabilities  primarily associated with the fiscal acquisition of confluent 
holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies 
the net cash provided by continuing financing activities of million was primarily the result of the issuance of external debt of billion  partially offset by allocated debt activity of billion  net transfer to tyco international of billion and the repayment of external debt of million 

table of contents capitalization shareholders equity was billion  or per share  at september   compared with billion  or per share  at september  net income of million was largely offset by dividends declared of million  the repurchase of shares of million and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of million 
at september   total debt was billion and cash was billion  compared with total debt of billion and cash of billion at september  total debt as a percentage of total capitalization total debt and shareholders equity was at september   compared with at september  we are required to maintain an available unused balance under our billion revolving credit facility sufficient to support amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program 
at september   we had million of commercial paper outstanding and no amount outstanding under the credit facility 
our credit facility agreement contains a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  the agreement contains other customary covenants  none of which we consider restrictive to our operations 
we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
dividends dividend payments were million during fiscal on september   our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from per share to per share 
the dividend declared of per share to shareholders of record on october   totaling million  was paid on november  we expect that we will continue to pay dividends comparable to this increased amount to holders of our ordinary shares 
the timing  declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary shares  however  falls within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the statutory requirements of irish law  our earnings and financial condition  the capital requirements of our businesses  industry practice and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
share repurchases during fiscal  our board of directors authorized a program to purchase up to million of our ordinary shares to partially offset dilution related to equity compensation plans 
shares may be repurchased from time to time  based on market conditions 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million ordinary shares for million under this program 
we also repurchase shares from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with the vesting of restricted shares 
in addition  we repurchase shares to settle certain option exercises 
during fiscal  an additional million was spent to acquire shares in connection with such share based awards 
in fiscal  prior to the reorganization discussed under recent developments  we retired the million shares that covidien ltd 
held in treasury 

table of contents commitments and contingencies contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for external debt  minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at september  is presented in the following table 
dollars in millions total thereafter debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations interest on debt and capital lease obligations are projected for future periods using interest rates in effect as of september  certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates 
purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements 
the table above does not include billion of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and million of associated accrued interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows  we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
this table does not include other liabilities of million  primarily consisting of liabilities pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits  environmental liabilities  insurable liabilities and deferred compensation  because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain 
however  the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be million in fiscal in addition  we expect to make contributions of million to our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal at september   we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of million 
legal proceedings we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including patent infringement claims  antitrust claims  product liability matters  environmental matters  employment disputes  disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes 
we believe that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time 
although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings  based upon our experience  current information and applicable law  we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period 
item legal proceedings and note to our financial statements provide further information regarding legal proceedings 
income taxes in accordance with the tax sharing agreement  we share certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy tyco international  with covidien assuming  tyco international and tyco electronics of the total amount 
we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for billion of contingent tax liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet at september   billion of which relates to periods prior to the separation and is shared with tyco international and tyco electronics pursuant to 
table of contents the tax sharing agreement 
the actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the tax sharing agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters  which may not occur for several years 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the tax sharing agreement  we have recorded a long term receivable from tyco international and tyco electronics of million  which is classified as due from former parent and affiliates on our balance sheet at september  this receivable primarily reflects of our contingent tax liabilities that are subject to the tax sharing agreement 
if tyco international and tyco electronics default on their obligations to us under the tax sharing agreement  however  we would be liable for the entire amount of such liabilities 
our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities 
open periods for examination include certain periods during which we were a subsidiary of tyco international 
the resolution of these matters is subject to the conditions set forth in the tax sharing agreement 
tyco international has the right to administer  control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to the separation 
we have significant potential tax liabilities related to these periods and have included our best estimate of the amounts which relate to our operations within our non current income taxes payable 
the irs has concluded its field examination of certain of tyco international s us federal income tax returns for the years through tyco international has appealed certain of the tax adjustments proposed by the irs which affect all three of the companies and total approximately billion 
we believe that the amounts recorded in our financial statements related to these matters are adequate 
in addition  in september  tyco international and the irs entered into settlements related to certain outstanding tax matters within the through audit cycle  which cycle remains open and subject to examination and resolution of other matters 
the net effect of the settlements will require us to make a payment of approximately million to the irs  potentially in fiscal  which is included in non current income taxes payable on the balance sheet 
however  pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  we will receive payments totaling approximately million from tyco international and tyco electronics  which is included in due from former parent and affiliates 
the impacts of these settlements are reflected in income tax expense and other income  respectively 
we will also be required to reimburse tyco international and tyco electronics an insignificant amount for our portion of their settlements 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and tax sharing agreement  we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and tyco electronics 
these guarantee arrangements and indemnifications primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities  we assumed and are responsible for of these liabilities 
regarding the guarantees  if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs related to any such liability  we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation 
these arrangements were valued upon our separation from tyco international using appraisals and liabilities related to these guarantees were recorded on our balance sheet  the offset of which was reflected as a reduction in shareholders equity 
each reporting period  we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable as a result of our commitments under the agreements 
to the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount recorded on our balance sheet  an adjustment will be required to increase the recorded liabilities to the amount of such potential loss 
this guarantee is not amortized because no predictable pattern of performance currently exists 
as a result  the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations under the agreements  which may not occur for some years 
in addition  as payments are made to indemnified parties  such payments are recorded as 
table of contents reductions to the liability and the impact of such payments is considered in the periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability 
during fiscal  following analyses of the tax contingency reserves allocated to us and tyco electronics at the separation date  we increased our guaranteed tax liability by million 
a liability of million and million relating to these guarantees was included on our balance sheet at september  and september   respectively 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and indemnities to cover various risks  including unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
we do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities  which are discussed in note to our financial statements 
in addition  we are liable for product performance  however in the opinion of management  such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer  which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site  based on contract terms or legal requirements in non us jurisdictions 
in certain circumstances  we enter into arrangements in which we provide multiple deliverables to our customers 
agreements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting 
total revenue is first allocated among the deliverables based upon their relative fair values 
revenue is then recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the principles described above 
fair values are determined based on sales of the individual deliverables to other third parties 
we sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers 
rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer 
provisions for rebates  as well as sales discounts and returns  are accounted for as reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in the reserve for returns  rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade on our balance sheets 
we estimate rebates based on sales terms  historical experience and trend analyses 
in estimating rebates  we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor s rebate claim  distributor specific trend analyses  contractual commitments  including stated rebate rates  and other relevant information 
we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience  and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment 
historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future 
rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal amounted to billion 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost primarily first in  first out or market value 
we reduce the carrying value of inventory based on estimates of what is excess  slow moving and obsolete  as well 
table of contents as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these write downs are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if future market conditions and actual demands ultimately are less favorable than those projected  we would further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record a charge to earnings at the time such determination was made 
subsequent changes in the estimates used to determine what is excess  slow moving or obsolete may result in an increase to earnings 
actual results historically have not differed materially from management s estimates 
property  plant and equipment management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of property  plant and equipment relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present  the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business 
we assess the recoverability of assets using undiscounted cash flows 
if an asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is estimated based upon the present value of discounted future cash flows or other reasonable estimates of fair value 
fair values are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of property  plant and equipment  there is a risk that the carrying value of our property  plant and equipment may be overstated or understated 
intangible assets intangible assets include intellectual property consisting primarily of patents  trademarks  unpatented technology and customer lists 
we record intangible assets at cost and amortize certain of such assets using the straight line method over ten to forty years 
amortization expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
intangible assets that are not subject to amortization  which are comprised primarily of certain trademarks  are tested for impairment in the same manner as goodwill 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment in the same manner as property  plant and equipment discussed above 
business combinations we allocate amounts paid for acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including purchased research and development 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of in process projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
the primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval 
we currently expense the value attributable to in process research and development projects at the time of acquisition  however as discussed in recently issued accounting pronouncements  beginning in fiscal  such amounts will be capitalized as an indefinite lived asset 
the valuation of in process research and development is determined using the discounted cash flow method 
in determining the value of in process research and development  we consider  among other factors  appraisals  the stage of completion of the projects  the technological feasibility of the projects  whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of 
table of contents acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money  as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized 
goodwill in performing goodwill assessments  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated 
we calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit 
this approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates  discount factors and income tax rates 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
we utilize a two step approach 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analyses and valuation  using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
contingencies we are involved  both as a plaintiff and a defendant  in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business  including  without limitation  patent infringement  product liability and environmental matters  as further discussed in note to our financial statements 
accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings  self insurance and other claims are based on judgment  the probability of losses and  where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates 
when a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made  we record the minimum loss contingency amount 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period  as additional information is available 
accordingly  we are often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore we record the minimum amount  which could be zero 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
we record receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement 
in making this determination  we consider applicable deductibles  policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
for our us plans  the discount rate is based on the market rate for a broad population of moody s aa rated corporate bonds over million 
for our non us plans  the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates 
a decrease in the discount 
table of contents rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately million 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
guarantees pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and tax sharing agreement  we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and tyco electronics 
see off balance sheet information guarantees for more information 
in addition  we have  from time to time  provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties 
these guarantees have not been material to our financial statements and the maximum potential payments are not material 
we periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements  and  in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs  a charge to income will be required 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and international pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 
we have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it appears to be more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets will be realized 
our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of billion and billion at september  and september   respectively  relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
included in the valuation allowance at both september  and september  is approximately billion which represents a full valuation allowance against certain non us net operating losses recorded in fiscal as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling 
it is highly unlikely that any of this net operating loss will be utilized 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction to realize the tax benefits related to the net deferred tax assets in our balance sheets 
however  any reduction in future taxable income  including any future restructuring activities  may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
our income tax expense recorded in the future may also be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon resolution of the contingency 
to the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position  an income tax liability is established 
interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in income tax expense 
we adjust these liabilities as a result of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate 
table of contents resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
substantially all of our potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current income taxes payable on our balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes  however  which would have a material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued enhanced disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the additional disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the required disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities are presented in note to our financial statements 
accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in september  the fasb issued authoritative literature regarding accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
additional financial statement disclosures are also required 
we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions at the end of fiscal  and accordingly  recognized an after tax reduction of million in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
in addition  companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end 
we previously used a measurement date of august st  however  in the first quarter of fiscal  we transitioned to a measurement date that coincides with our fiscal year end 
the adoption of the measurement date provision resulted in a reduction to shareholders equity to reflect the incremental one month charge from august to september 
accounting for uncertain tax positions in june  the fasb issued authoritative literature  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
this literature prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
on september   we adopted these provisions 
the cumulative effect of adopting these provisions was a million reduction in retained earnings  a million increase in deferred tax assets  primarily due to interest and state specific items  and a million and million increase in income taxes payable and receivable  respectively 
in addition  we recorded an increase in amounts due from former parent and affiliates pursuant to the tax sharing agreement of million as other income  representing the indirect effect of adoption 
notes and to our financial statements provide additional information regarding income taxes and the tax sharing agreement  respectively 
recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets in december  the fasb issued enhanced disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets 
the additional disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of a how investment allocation decisions are made  b the major categories of plan assets  c the inputs and valuation 
table of contents techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  d the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period and e significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
we are required to comply with these disclosure requirements beginning in fiscal business combinations in december  the fasb issued authoritative literature on business combinations  which expands the definition of a business combination and changes the manner in which we account for business combinations beginning in fiscal significant changes include the capitalization of in process research and development as an indefinite lived asset  the recognition of certain acquired contingent assets and liabilities at fair value  the expensing of acquisition related restructuring actions and transaction costs  and the recognition of contingent purchase price consideration at fair value on the acquisition date 
in addition  post acquisition changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit 
the accounting treatment for taxes will be applicable to acquisitions that close both prior and subsequent to the adoption of this pronouncement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
in order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts 
foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 
such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the united states 
we use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts on accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable  intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing contracts outstanding at september   a appreciation of the us dollar from the september  market rates would increase the unrealized value of contracts on our balance sheet by million  while a depreciation of the us dollar would decrease the unrealized value of contracts on our balance sheet by million 
however  such gains or losses on these contracts would ultimately be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions 

table of contents concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments 
we invest our excess cash in deposits or money market funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions that have at least an a credit rating 
we provide credit and do not generally require collateral  however  concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas 
counterparties to our derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an a a long term debt rating 
while we do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments  we minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions and actively monitoring outstanding positions
