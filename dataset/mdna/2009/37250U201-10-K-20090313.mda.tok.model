item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report 
overview geomet  inc is an independent energy company primarily engaged in the exploration for and development and production of natural gas from coal seams coalbed methane or cbm and non conventional shallow gas 
we were originally founded as a consulting company to the coalbed methane industry in and have been active as an operator and developer of coalbed methane properties since our principal operations and producing properties are located in the cahaba basin in alabama and the central appalachian basin in west virginia and virginia 
we also control additional coalbed methane and oil and gas development rights  principally in alabama  british columbia  virginia  and west virginia 
as of december   we control a total of approximately  net acres of coalbed methane and oil and gas development rights 
our proved natural gas reserves as of december  as estimated by degolyer and macnaughton  independent petroleum engineers  totaled approximately bcf  a decrease of from the approximate bcf of proved natural gas reserves at year end proved reserve estimates for the current year were calculated using an unescalated natural gas price of per mmbtu  adjusted for regional price differentials  as compared to an unescalated natural gas price in the prior year of per mmbtu 
our proved reserves were from unconventional reservoirs  were from coalbed methane and were developed 
the present value of proved reserves discounted at ten percent was approximately million at december  as compared to million at year end although reserves declined from year end  before downward revisions and a property conveyance the company replaced approximately of its production in downward revisions totaled approximately bcf of which approximately bcf resulted from lower natural gas prices 
the remaining downward revisions were primarily in the gurnee field in alabama  resulting from production performance issues in certain sectors of the field 
approximately of total year end proved reserves are in the gurnee field in alabama and are in the pond creek and lasher fields in west virginia and virginia 
the peace river project is the first commercial coalbed methane project in british columbia  canada and there are no other similar producing analogies in the region 
as a result  initial proved developed reserves of only bcf were booked in similarly  our garden city project it is the first commercial chattanooga shale project in alabama  and only bcf of initial proved reserves were booked in impact of current credit market conditions we believe that we are well positioned for the current credit market environment 
we have a healthy balance sheet with over million in cash and a debt to book capital ratio of 
the borrowing base on our revolving credit facility was set at million on march  under the terms of the determination  our borrowing cost was increased by approximately basis points and the fee on the undrawn portion of the borrowing base was increased by basis points 
if not extended  our credit facility will mature in january as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the credit agreement 
all of our lenders are currently funding our borrowing requests 
impact of decreasing natural gas prices we account for our gas properties using the full cost method and are required to impair a full cost pool when the net capitalized costs in the pool exceed the discounted future net revenues of the proved reserves associated with the pool 
based upon the lower natural gas prices at december   we have reported a non cash impairment to our us full cost pool of million  net of income tax 
due to limited initial proved reserve bookings in the peace river project we also reported a non cash

if natural gas prices at march  are below those prices that existed at december   geomet expects to record a non cash impairment to the company s natural gas properties for the quarter then ended 
trends our business is influenced by trends that affect the natural gas industry 
in particular  recent declines in natural gas prices and recent economic trends could adversely affect our business  liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
our business is increasingly subject to the adverse trends that have taken place in the global capital markets recently 
the recent events in the credit and stock markets indicate a high likelihood of a continuation of  and probable further expansion of  the economic weakness in the us economy that began over one year ago 
the spillover of deepening fears about our banking system may adversely impact investor confidence in us  our banking relationships  and the liquidity and financial condition of third parties with whom we conduct operations 
we expect to face the continuing challenges of weakness in the us real estate market and increased mortgage delinquencies  investor anxiety over the us economy  rating agency downgrades of various financial issuers  unresolved issues with structured investment vehicles  deleveraging of financial institutions and hedge funds and dislocation in the inter bank market 
if significant  continued volatility  changes in interest rates  defaults  market liquidity  declines in equity prices  and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar  individually or in tandem  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows through realized losses  and impairments 
although we expect to experience a reduction in the level of our capital spending in  we believe the steps we have taken to date in response to the global slowdown in the natural gas industry will positively impact our ability to follow through with our business strategy without being forced to implement additional significant countermeasures  such as work force layoffs 
other potential steps that could be implemented in light of the current recession  if we deem it necessary  could include selling assets or entering into more joint venture agreements with industry partners to reduce our costs 
the natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make  and anticipate that we will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures in the exploration for  development and acquisition of natural gas reserves 
historically  our capital expenditures have been financed primarily with internally generated cash from operations  proceeds from bank borrowings  and industry joint venture arrangements 
the continued availability of these capital sources depends upon a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the volumes of natural gas we produce from existing wells  the prices at which we sell natural gas  our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves  and events occurring within the global capital markets 
except for the existing revolving credit facility we have with our bank lenders  we do not currently have any agreements for any future financing and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such future financing 
natural gas price trends changes in natural gas prices significantly affect our revenues  financial condition  cash flows and borrowing capacity 
markets for natural gas have historically been volatile and we expect this trend to continue 
prices for natural gas typically fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty  seasonal  political and other factors beyond our control 
we are unable to accurately predict the prices we receive for our natural gas 
accordingly  any significant or sustained declines in natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically 
a decline in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the estimated value and estimated quantities of our

operational developments pond creek we connected new infill wells to sales in giving us a total of productive wells in the pond creek field 
net gas sales increased to mmcf per day for the year ended december   as compared to mmcf per day for the year ended december  lasher initial gas sales commenced on october  we connected a total of wells to sales in net gas sales averaged mmcf per day for the period of october  through december  gurnee we connected new infill wells to sales in giving us a total of productive wells in the gurnee field 
net gas sales were unchanged at mmcf per day for the years ended december  and garden city in this chattanooga shale prospect two vertical wells were re stimulated and a horizontal well drilled in the second quarter was completed in the third quarter 
these three wells were connected to sales in the third quarter with net gas sales averaging mmcf per day through december  two vertical test wells drilled in the western portion of the prospect are currently shut in awaiting the identification of adequate water disposal and connection into a gas sales line 
we are still evaluating potential water disposal solutions 
peace river on december   we commenced gas deliveries from eight wells at peace river 
we own a working interest and operate the project which covers over  acres of crown tenure 
four coreholes and twelve production wells have been drilled  targeting the lower cretaceous gething coals 
average coal thickness over the acreage is feet  and the average gas content is cubic feet per ton 
property conveyance and dispute we had previously entered into an agreement to sell our interests in a property  subject to a preferential right to purchase held by another party  which the other party subsequently exercised 
a dispute arose as to whether the preferential right to purchase applied to all the interests we owned in this property or just the working interests 
we filed a declaratory judgment action asserting that the preferential right to purchase applied only to the working interests  and that we were entitled to retain all remaining interests we owned in the property 
following a partial agreement with the other party  we assigned all our remaining interests in the property to that party  effective july  on october   the th judicial district court of dallas issued an order requiring us to pay  to the other party in final settlement of the issue 
we have subsequently reached a settlement with the other party in the amount of  which has been accrued as a liability as of december  the proved reserves conveyed represented less than of our total proved reserves and the related production was approximately mcf per day 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included 
table of contents 
index to financial statements elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments  estimates  and a high degree of uncertainty in the preparation of our financial statements reserves 
our most significant financial estimates are based on estimates of proved gas reserves 
proved gas reserves represent estimated quantities of gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production  and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process relies on assumptions and interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering  and production data and  the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geologic interpretation  and judgment 
in addition  as a result of changing market conditions  natural gas prices and future development costs will change from year to year  causing estimates of proved reserves to also change 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our most significant financial estimates involving our unevaluated properties  our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by degolyer and macnaughton  independent petroleum engineers 
gas properties the method of accounting for gas properties determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expenses 
we use the full cost method of accounting for gas properties as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
under this method  all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  and development of our gas properties are capitalized and segregated into us and canadian cost centers 
gas properties are depleted using the units of production method 
the depletion expense is significantly affected by the unamortized historical and future development costs and the estimated proved gas reserves 
estimation of proved gas reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined 
subsequent proved reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting period 
no gains or losses are recognized upon the sale or disposition of gas properties unless the sale or disposition represents a significant quantity of gas reserves  which would have a significant impact on the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
under full cost accounting rules  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling equal to the present value of future net revenues  discounted at per annum  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties less income tax effects the ceiling limitation 
we perform a quarterly ceiling test to evaluate whether the net book value of our full cost pool exceeds the ceiling limitation 
the ceiling test is imposed separately for our us and canadian cost centers 
if capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less related deferred taxes are greater than the discounted future net revenues or ceiling limitation  a write down or impairment of the full cost pool is required 
a write down of the carrying value of the full cost pool is a non cash charge that reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
the ceiling limitation test is calculated using natural gas prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for basis or location differential  held constant over the life of the reserves 
in addition  subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations are not included in the computation of the discounted present value of future net revenues for the purposes of the ceiling limitation test calculation 
at december   the carrying value of the company s gas properties in the us exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by  net of income tax of  based upon a natural gas price of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements approximately per mcf in effect at that date 
a decline in prices received for gas sales or an increase in operating costs or reductions in estimated economically recoverable quantities could result in the recognition of an impairment of our gas properties in a future period 
in the year ended december   we recognized an impairment of our gas properties of  net of income tax of  at december   the carrying value of the company s gas properties in canada exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by  no income tax effect as canadian income taxes are fully valued  based upon a natural gas price of approximately per mcf in effect at that date 
a decline in prices received for gas sales or an increase in operating costs or reductions in estimated economically recoverable quantities could result in the recognition of an impairment of our gas properties in a future period 
in the year ended december   we recognized an impairment of our gas properties of if natural gas prices at march  are below those prices that existed at december   geomet expects to record a non cash impairment to the company s natural gas properties for the quarter then ended 
unevaluated properties the costs directly associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development are not initially included in the amortization base and relate to unproved leasehold acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination of proved reserves together with overhead and interest costs capitalized for these projects 
unevaluated leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base once determination has been made or upon expiration of a lease 
geological and geophysical costs associated with a specific unevaluated property are transferred to the amortization base with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
all items included in our unevaluated property balance are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
any impairment to unevaluated properties is transferred to the amortization base 
asset retirement liability we adopted sfas  effective january  it establishes accounting and reporting standards for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets that result from the legal obligation to plug  abandon and dismantle existing wells and facilities that we have acquired  constructed or developed 
it requires that the fair value of the liability for asset retirement obligations be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
upon initial recognition of the asset retirement liability  the asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
income taxes we record our income taxes using an asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of the sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates at the end of the period 
under sfas  the effect of a change in tax rates of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted change 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
estimating the amount of valuation allowance is dependent on estimates of future taxable income  alternative minimum tax income  and changes in stockholder ownership that could trigger limits on use of net operating losses under internal revenue code section we have a significant deferred tax asset associated with net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 
table of contents 
index to financial statements accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a consistent threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and disclosure of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on a tax return 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and gas balancing 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas 
we use the sales method of accounting for the recognition of gas revenue whereby revenues  net of royalties  are recognized as the production is sold to purchaser 
the amount of gas sold may differ from the amount to which the company is entitled based on its working interest or net revenue interest in the properties 
we typically do not have any significant producer gas imbalance positions because we own working interest in the majority of our properties 
a ready market for natural gas allows us to sell our natural gas shortly after production at various pipeline receipt points at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the buyer 
revenue is recorded when title is transferred based on our nominations and net revenue interests 
pipeline imbalances occur when our production delivered into the pipeline varies from the gas we nominated for sale 
pipeline imbalances are settled with cash approximately thirty days from date of production and are recorded as a reduction of revenue or increase of revenue depending upon whether we are over delivered or under delivered 
settlements of gas sales occur after the month in which the gas was produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available at the time financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period during which payments are received from the purchaser 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our hedging activities consist of derivative instruments entered into to hedge against changes in natural gas prices and changes in interest rates related to outstanding debt under our credit facility primarily through the use of fixed price swap agreements  basis swap agreements  three way collars  and traditional collars 
consistent with our hedging policy  we entered into a series of derivative instruments to hedge a significant portion of our expected natural gas production through and we also entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rates associated with a portion of our variable rate debt through typically  these derivative instruments require payments to receipts from counterparties based on specific indices as required by the derivative agreements 
these transactions are recorded in our financial statements in accordance with sfas l although not risk free  we believe this policy will reduce our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and changes in interest rates and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow 
as a result  our derivative instruments are cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
in accordance with sfas  as amended  all our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value and changes in the fair market value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings for the natural gas derivatives or other comprehensive income loss for our interest rate swaps 
the natural gas derivatives have not been designated as hedge transactions while the interest rate swaps qualify and have been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas at the inception of a derivative contract  we may designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
for all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  we document the relationship between the derivative instrument and the hedged items as well as the risk management objective for entering into the derivative instrument 
to be designated as a cash flow hedge transaction  the relationship between the derivative and hedge items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the risk both at the inception of the derivative and on an ongoing basis 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the prospective transition method 
the application of sfas r requires the use of an option pricing model  such as the black scholes model  to measure the estimated fair value of the options and as a result various assumptions must be made by management that require judgment and the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements assumptions could be highly uncertain 
for share based awards outstanding prior to the adoption of sfas r  we will continue using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards before adoption 
therefore  we do not recognize any equity compensation cost on these prior awards in the future unless such awards are modified  repurchased or cancelled 
fair value measurement in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  effective january   we adopted sfas  which provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap 
sfas defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
sfas also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level inputs are derived from unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
see disclosure related to the implementation of sfas in note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fasb has also issued staff position fas fsp  which delays the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected to defer the application of sfas thereof to nonfinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with fsp non recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for which the company has not applied the provisions of sfas include those measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing  asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value  and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination 
on october   the fasb issued staff position no 
fas fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
on january   we will adopt sfas as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities  including nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a business combination  impaired property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and initial recognition of asset retirement obligations 
there has been no significant impact to our consolidated financial statements related to the implementation of sfas for our existing non financial assets and liabilities

gas sales increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
the increase in gas sales was a result of both increased gas prices and production 
production increased and average gas prices  excluding hedging transactions  increased 
the million increase in gas sales consisted of a million increase in production and a million increase in average prices 
the increase in production was principally attributable to the continued development activities at our pond creek and gurnee fields

compression expense 
compression expense increased by million  or  to million compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase in compression expense consisted of a million increase in production and a million increase in costs 
the million increase in costs was primarily due to an increase in repair and maintenance expenses for the compressors in our pond creek field 
transportation expense 
transportation expense decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the decrease was primarily due to lower transportation expenses resulting from the commencement of transportation on our own system from the pond creek field and the temporary release of a portion of our firm capacity commitments related to our pond creek field 
production taxes 
production taxes increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the increase in production taxes was due to the phase in of state taxes on production of natural gas in our pond creek field  higher gas prices and increased production

interest expense net of amounts capitalized 
interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
gross interest expense for the period was million net of million capitalized 
gross interest expense decreased from the prior year period due to lower interest rates  while capitalized interest decreased from the prior year period due to the deferral of certain capital projects 
income tax benefit 
income tax benefit was million in the current year as compared to an expense of million in the prior year period

unrealized gains losses from the change in market value of open derivative contracts 
unrealized gains losses from the change in market value of open derivative contracts generated a million loss as compared to a million gain in the prior period 
unrealized losses and gains are non cash transactions that occur when the corresponding asset or liability derivative contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
unrealized gains are recognized when the fair values of derivative assets increase or the fair value of derivative liabilities decrease 
unrealized losses are recognized when the fair values of derivative assets decrease or the fair value of derivative liabilities increase 
the million loss was a result of increased future natural gas prices 
interest expense net of amounts capitalized

the increase was primarily due to higher outstanding debt and higher interest rates 
capitalized interest totaled million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased by million to million 
the decrease in income tax expense for the period was due to decreased pretax income compared to the prior period 
in addition  the effective tax rate decreased for the year to from in the comparable prior period 
the principal driver for the difference in the effective tax rate was due to lower state income taxes resulting from state apportionment factor shifting 
discontinued operations 
in september of  we discontinued the third party marketing business and second reportable segment which had been created in connection with the consolidation of shamrock energy llc  a variable interest entity under fin r on august  the consolidation of the variable interest entity had no impact on our net income loss due to the minority interest to shamrock energy llc

based on current gas price projections  we expect capital expenditures to be less than the million capital budget we previously announced 
the development of coalbed methane fields requires substantial initial investment before meaningful production and resulting cash flows are realized 
among the factors that can be expected to affect our cash flows and liquidity are the characteristics of the field  the amount of water produced  the methods utilized to dispose of produced water  the transportation alternatives  and the timing and volume of initial and subsequent natural gas production volumes 
based upon current expectations  we believe that we will have adequate resources from cash flows provided by operations and from proceeds from our revolving credit facility borrowings to fund our capital expenditures and other working capital needs 
currently  there is an unprecedented uncertainty in the financial markets 
the uncertainty in the market brings additional potential risks to us 
the risks include less availability and higher costs of additional credit  potential counterparty defaults  and further commercial bank failures 
although the financial institutions in our bank group appear to be strong  there are some that have been and could be considered take over candidates 
although we have no indication that any such transactions would impact our current credit facility  the possibility does exist 
financial market disruptions may impact our ability to collect trade receivables 
we constantly monitor the credit worthiness of our customers 
we believe that our current group of customers are sound and represent no abnormal business risk 
if natural gas prices decrease from their current levels for an extended period  our ability to finance our planned capital expenditures could be affected negatively  consistent with our intention to keep our capital expenditures in line with our estimated operating cash flows  further reduction in spending may be necessary 
furthermore  amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility are largely dependent on our level of estimated proved reserves and current natural gas prices 
if either our estimated proved reserves or natural gas prices decrease  amounts available to us to borrow under our revolving credit facility could be negatively affected 
if our cash flows are less than anticipated  amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility are reduced or we are unable to sell equity at acceptable prices  we may be forced to defer planned capital expenditures

we are exposed to natural gas price risk associated with downward movements in natural gas prices 
natural gas prices have experienced volatility in recent years in response to changes in the supply and demand for natural gas and market uncertainty 
the markets and prices for natural gas depend upon factors beyond our control and changes in these prices could adversely affect our revenue and cash flows 
these factors include demand for natural gas  which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors  including the impact of seasonality and weather  general economic conditions  the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption  the availability of imported natural gas  actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations  the availability of local  intrastate and interstate transportation systems  the availability and marketing of competitive fuels  the impact of energy conservation efforts  technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation 
in an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of natural gas on our operations  management has adopted a policy of hedging natural gas prices from time to time primarily using derivative instruments in the form of three way collars  traditional collars and swaps 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits future gains from favorable movements 
our price risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative positions 
we enter into hedging transactions that increase our statistical probability of achieving our targeted level of cash flows and at times hedge forward for periods of more than two years 
we generally limit the amount of these hedges during any period to no more than to of the then expected gas production for such future periods 
we have historically used swaps  costless collars and three way costless collars in our hedging activities 
swaps exchange floating price risk in the future for a fixed price at the time of the hedge 
costless collars set both a maximum ceiling a sold ceiling and a minimum floor a bought floor future price 
three way costless collars are similar to regular costless collars except that  in order to increase the ceiling price  we agree to limit the amount of the floor price protection through a sold floor to a predetermined amount  generally between and per mmbtu 
we have accounted for these transactions using the mark to market accounting method 
generally  we incur accounting losses during periods where prices are rising and gains during periods where prices are falling which may cause significant fluctuations in our consolidated statement of operations 
we believe that the use of derivative instruments does not expose us to material risk 
however  the use of derivative instruments may materially affect our financial position and results of operations as a result of changes in the estimated market value of our natural gas derivatives 
nevertheless  we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
the following gains losses on our hedging instruments included in the consolidated statements of operations are as follows realized losses gains on derivative contracts unrealized gains losses on derivative contracts total gains losses

hedges of our interest rate are designated as cash flow hedges based on whether the interest on the underlying debt is converted to a fixed interest rate 
changes in derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred as other comprehensive income loss or loss to the extent that they are effective and then recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur 
we use fixed rate swaps to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with the objective of realizing a fixed cash flow stream from these activities 
at december   we had the following interest rate swaps description effective date designated maturity date fixed rate notional amount fair value floating to fixed swap floating to fixed swap floating to fixed swap floating to fixed swap the floating rate paid by the counterparty is the british bankers association libor rate 
for the year ended december   we recognized no ineffective portion of our cash flow hedges 
we have reviewed the financial strength of our hedge counterparties and believe our credit risk to be minimal 
our hedge counterparties are participants in our credit agreement and the collateral for the outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement is used as collateral for our hedges 
we do not have rights to collateral from our counterparties  nor do we have rights of offset against borrowings under our credit agreement 
the application of sfas currently applies to our derivative instruments 
under the provisions of sfas  we estimate the fair value of our natural gas hedges and interest rate swaps using the income approach 
the income approach uses valuation techniques that convert future cash flows to a single discounted value 
sfas clarifies that a fair value measurement for an asset or liability reflects its nonperformance risk  the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled 
because nonperformance risk includes our counterparties and our credit risk  we have considered the effect of our credit risk on the fair value of the liabilities stated below 
this consideration involved discounting our counterparties and our liabilities based on the difference between the s p credit rating of a comparable company to ours and the week treasury bill rate  both at december  the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for our derivative instruments measured at fair value natural gas hedges in order to estimate the fair value of our natural gas hedge positions  a forward price curve and volatility estimates were compiled from sources that include nymex settlements and

pricing estimates for the theoretical market value of hedge positions were developed using analytical models accepted and employed by a broad cross section of industry participants 
to extrapolate future cash flows  discount factors incorporating our counterparties and our credit standing are used to discount future cash flows 
interest rate swaps in order to estimate the fair value of our interest rate swaps  we use a yield curve based on money market rates and interest rate swaps  extrapolate a forecast of future interest rates  estimate each future cash flow  derive discount factors to value the fixed and floating rate cash flows of each swap  and then discount to present value all known fixed and forecasted floating swap cash flows 
curve building and discounting techniques used to establish the theoretical market value of interest bearing securities are based on readily available money market rates and interest rate swap market data 
to extrapolate future cash flows  discount factors incorporating our counterparties and our credit standing are used to discount future cash flows 
based on the use of observable market inputs  we have designated these types of instruments as level for sfas reporting purposes

under the terms of the determination  our borrowing cost was increased by approximately basis points and the fee on the undrawn portion of the borrowing base was increased by basis points 
borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our assets including equity interests in our subsidiaries 
all outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement become due and payable on january  we are subject to financial covenants requiring maintenance of a minimum current ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
our ratio of consolidated current assets adjusted for unrealized gains losses on derivative contracts and borrowing availability to our consolidated current liabilities is not permitted to be less than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  and our ratio of consolidated ebitda for the four preceding quarters at the end of each fiscal quarter to the sum of our consolidated net interest expense for the same period plus letter of credit fees accruing during such quarter is not permitted to be less than to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the amended credit agreement  excludes other non cash charges deducted in determining net income loss  which would include unrealized losses from the change in the market value of open derivative contracts 
in addition  we are subject to covenants restricting or prohibiting cash dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of debt  consolidations and mergers  the level of operating leases  assets sales  investments in other entities  and liens on properties 
a breach of any of the covenants imposed on us by the terms of our revolving credit facility  including the financial covenants  could result in a default under such indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the lenders could terminate their commitments to us

in such case  we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations  and our lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the facility 
any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business

as of december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately k 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing and amount of any payments related to this liability because there are currently no outstanding unpaid assessments from any tax authority  and it is likely that assessments would be offset by existing deferred tax attributes as they arise 
discontinued operations as of september   we discontinued the third party marketing business and second reportable segment which had been created in connection with the consolidation of shamrock energy llc  a variable interest entity under fin r on august  the consolidation of the variable interest entity had no impact on our net income loss due to the minority interest to shamrock energy llc 
on january   we acquired shamrock energy llc as a wholly owned subsidiary and the consolidation of this wholly owned subsidiary had an insignificant impact on our net income loss 
as a result  we are treating our third party marketing activities as a discontinued operation for all the periods presented 
the marketing activities of shamrock energy llc have been transitioned to geomet  inc without disruption in the marketing of our gas  and we do not expect to incur significant liabilities or sell any assets in connection with discontinuing this business
