item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction we are an exploratory stage mining company  that is  we have option agreement on claims to numerous mining concessions in mexico  canada  peru  argentina and chile 
our current drilling program will concentrate on san miguel 
we have not proven that any of our mining concessions contain proven reserves or precious metals having commercial value 
comparison of operating results for the year ended june  as compared to june  revenues we are an exploratory mining company with no revenues from operations to date 
all of our revenues to date represent interest income which we have earned as a result of our cash holdings 
our cash holdings were generated from the sale of our securities 
interest income for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the year ended june  interest income since inception totals  interest income decreased by approximately from the prior year 
the significant decrease in our interest income is primarily due to significantly declining cash balances which were not reversed until the completion of a financing at the end of december our funds are deposited in an interest bearing account subject to transfer to our operating account to meet ongoing expenses 
we intend to utilize our cash reserves for ongoing exploration activities  land acquisitions and general working capital expendi tures 
operating expenses we incurred expenses totalling  as compared to  for the year ended  a decrease of approximately million 
the significant decrease in our expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease in exploration expenses of approximately million and a decrease in stock based compensation totalling approximately million 
other areas experiencing less significant cost reductions included travel and lodging  corporate communications and marketing 
the only area where we saw a significant increase in costs was with respect to office and administrative expenses which increased by approximately  during our last fiscal year  we incurred exploratory costs of  professional fees totalling  geologist fees and expenses of  marketing fees of  and office and administrative expenses totalling  these fees compare to exploratory fees of  professional fees of  geologist fees and expenses of  marketing fees of  and office and administrative expenses of  for the year ended june  the significant decline in our overall expenses as identified in our consolidated statement of operations is primarily attributable to management s decision to reduce drilling operations to preserve capital and to further evaluate drilling results 
while we continue to rely on stock based compensation  we have not relied on this financing source as much as in the past 
during our latest fiscal year stock based compensation declined from  to  we issued shares of our common stock for consulting and geological services 
with fewer personnel involved in our drilling program  stock based compensation has declined 
net income loss our net loss for the year ended june  was  as compared to a net loss of  in our prior year 
our net loss per share was as compared to a net loss per share of for the comparable periods in the decline in our net loss per share is directly attributable to an increase in the number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for was  as compared to  for until such time as we are able to identify mineral deposits which we believe can be extracted in a commercially reasonable manner  of which there can be no assurance  we anticipate that we will continue to incur ongoing losses 
liquidity and capital resources assets and liabilities at june  we had cash and cash equivalents totalling  as compared to  at june   an increase of approximately 
the significant increase in our cash reserves is a direct result of a private placement of our securities with fcmi in the amount of million in march accounts receivable declined from  at june  to  at june  similarly  prepaid deposits and expenses declined from  to  we had total current assets of  at june   as compared to  at june   an increase of approximately 
our mineral properties were valued as of june  at  as compared to  an increase of approximately 
the significant increase in the value of our mineral properties this past year is directly attributable to an increase in the size of our holdings 
during this past year  we issued  shares of our common stock for the acquisition of additional mineral properties valued at  approximately million of this total is attributable to our san miguel concession and million is attributable to our temoris concession 
see footnotes and we also have a short term receivable of  which is non redeemable until may  and bears interest at the rate of per annum 
fixed assets totalled  as compared to  our long term assets at june  totaled  as compared to  at june   almost all of which is attributable to the increase in our mineral properties 
total assets at june  were  as compared to  at june   an increase of approximately 
our current liabilities as of june  totalled  as compared to  as of june  we have a working capital surplus of  as compared to a working capital surplus of  at june  we believe that our working capital surplus will enable us to meet our anticipated drilling and operational needs  subject to any costs that we incur with respect to the acquisition of additional mineral properties 
acquisition of additional mineral properties will likely require a cash infusion from either debt or equity financing  of which there can be no assurance 
results of operations for the year ended june  with respect to our short term liquidity  our current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities as of june  was as compared to as of june  the current ratio is a commonly used as a measure of a company s liquidity 
our management believes  however  that with a company still in the exploratory stage  the ratio may not be as significant as with an ongoing business in comparing the company with others in the industry 
in analyzing our liquidity  we look at actual dollars  we compare our cash on hand and other short term assets with our bills payable and other short term obligations 
since our only source of funds has been from the periodic sale of securities  it will be very difficult for us to meet our current and anticipated obligations for a significant period of time without raising additional capital 
if we are not able to raise adequate capital and to do so in a timely mann er  we will not be able to fully implement our business plan or sustain ongoing operations 
if and when we are able to begin production  which is highly uncertain  we will make an evaluation to determine whether cash reserves should be established or other steps taken to minimize possible adverse consequences due to environmental matters 
such evaluation will consider  among other factors  the land or other sources from which the raw materials are taken and the land upon which the processing is done  the nature of any chemicals used in the processing  and the nature  extent  and means of disposition of the residue from the processing 
since our inception  we have funded our activities by issuing common stock 
although we will continue periodically to seek external sources of funds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations 
if we do raise equity capital  depending on the number of shares issued and the issue price of the shares  current stockholders interests may be diluted 
the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes that the company will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business 
the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company s ability to generate profitable operations in the future  to maintain adequate financing  and to achieve a positive cash flow 
there is no assurance it will be able to meet any or all of such goals 
plan of operation exploration our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to focus our exploratory efforts on the san miguel groupings 
it is very difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty the extent of our drilling program for we are currently in month three of a twelve month exploratory drill program in mexico with a budgeted cost of million 
a portion of our working capital may be utilized to acquire additional mineral properties in which case we will have to carefully manage our exploratory program to preserve capital 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the sec  encourages all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and long lived assets 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we review the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property  if any  exceeds its fair market value 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting and according to the provision of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for development stage enterprises  as it was devoting substantially all of its efforts to acquiring and exploring mineral properties 
it is industry practice that mining companies in the development stage are classified under generally accepted accounting principles as exploration stage companies 
until such properties are acquired and developed  the company will continue to prepare its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with entities in the exploration or development stage 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  under the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r eliminates accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method prescribed under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
under the modified prospective method  we are required to recognize compensation cost for share based payments to employees based on their grant date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied 
for periods prior to adoption  the financial statements are unchanged  and the pro forma disclosures previously required by sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 will continue to be required under sfas no 
r to the extent those amounts differ from those in the consolidated statement of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not anticipate entering into any off balance sheet arrangements during the next months
