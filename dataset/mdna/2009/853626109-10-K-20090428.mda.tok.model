item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
although the company s management has concluded that its system of internal controls over financial reporting was effective as of february   there can be no assurance that the company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the system of internal controls over financial reporting in the future 
a material weakness in the company s system of internal controls over financial reporting would require management and or the company s independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate the company s system of internal controls as ineffective 
this in turn could lead to a loss of public confidence  which could adversely affect the company s business and the price of its common stock 
corporate governance in recent years  the nasdaq global select market  on which the company s common stock is listed  has adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations have increased  and may continue to increase  the scope  complexity and cost of the company s corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices 
failure to comply with these rules and regulations could adversely affect the company  and in a worst case  result in the delisting of its stock 
as a result of these rules  the company s board members  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other corporate officers could also face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  the company may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and officers  which would adversely affect its business 
further  these developments could affect the company s ability to secure desired levels of directors and officers liability insurance  requiring the company to accept reduced insurance coverage or to incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
changes in accounting for equity compensation the company has historically used stock options and sars as a key component of employee compensation in order to align employees interests with the interests of its stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board fasb adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles known as statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised sfas r requiring a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives which became effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal to the extent that this or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  the company may consider changes to its equity compensation strategy 
to the extent that such changes might limit the company s use of equity based compensation  it might become more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect the company s business 

table of contents environmental regulation environmental regulations and standards are established worldwide to control discharges  emissions  and solid wastes from manufacturing processes 
within the united states  federal  state and local agencies establish these regulations 
outside of the united states  individual countries and local governments establish their own individual standards 
the company believes that its activities conform to present environmental regulations and historically the effects of this compliance have not had a material effect on the company s capital expenditures  operating results  or competitive position 
future environmental compliance requirements  as well as amendments to or the adoption of new environmental regulations or the occurrence of an unforeseen circumstance could subject the company to fines or require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
in addition  many of the company s customers belong to trade groups or other similar bodies that are creating their own private governance  health  safety and environmental standards 
some of these customers are mandating that the company comply with these standards as a condition to selling product to these customers 
the company s sales and profitability may suffer it is unable to satisfy these private standards  or if complying with these standards imposes significant costs on the company

in january  the company consolidated operations at two previously leased facilities in austin  texas and has taken occupancy of a new  square foot facility in northern austin  texas 
the lease agreement has a term of one hundred and twenty five months  expiring in june the company currently expects to either renew existing leases or identify suitable alternative leased space for all leases expiring in fiscal it is not certain whether the company will negotiate new leases on its other facilities as such leases expire in fiscal and beyond 
such determinations will be made as those leases approach expiration and will be based on an assessment of requirements and market conditions at that time 
further  management believes that additional space can be readily obtained  if necessary  based on prior experience and current and expected real estate market conditions 
item legal proceedings from time to time as a normal consequence of doing business  various claims and litigation may be asserted or commenced against the company 
in particular  the company in the ordinary course of business may receive claims that its products infringe the intellectual property of third parties  or that customers have suffered damage as a result of defective products allegedly supplied by the company 
due to uncertainties inherent in litigation and other claims  the company can give no assurance that it will prevail in any such matters  which could subject the company to significant liability for damages and or invalidate its proprietary rights 
any lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention  and an adverse outcome of any significant matter could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or more of these matters are resolved 
on july   opti  inc opti filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas against the company  advanced micro devices  inc  atmel corporation  broadcom corporation  renesas technology america  inc  silicon storage technology  inc  stmicroelectronics  inc  and via technology  inc

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  included in part iv item a financial statements  of this report 
forward looking statements portions of this report may contain forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that are based on management s beliefs and assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections 
such statements  including statements relating to the company s expectations for future financial performance  are not considered historical facts and are considered forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
words such as believe  expect  anticipate and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these risks and related uncertainties may cause the company s actual future results to be materially different from those discussed in forward looking statements 
the company s risks and uncertainties include the timely development and market acceptance of new products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the company s ability to procure capacity from suppliers and the timely performance of their obligations  commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange  potential investment losses as a result of market liquidity conditions  the effects of changing economic conditions domestically and internationally and on its customers  relationships with and dependence on customers and growth rates in the personal computer  consumer electronics and embedded and automotive markets and within the company s sales channel  changes in customer order patterns  including order cancellations or reduced bookings  the effects of tariff  import and currency regulation  potential or actual litigation  and excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation  among others 
in addition  smsc competes in the semiconductor industry  which has historically been characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  price erosion and periods of mismatched supply and demand 
the company s forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations and may not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions  mergers or divestitures 
all forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and are based upon the information available to smsc at this time 
such statements are subject to change  and the company does not undertake to update such statements  except to the extent required under applicable law and regulation 
these and other risks and uncertainties  including potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation  are detailed from time to time in the company s periodic and current reports as filed with the sec 
readers are advised to review other sections of this report  including part i item a risk factors  for a more complete discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties 
other cautionary statements and risks and uncertainties may also appear elsewhere in this report 
description of business smsc designs and sells a wide range of silicon based integrated circuits that utilize analog and mixed signal technologies 
the company s integrated circuits and systems provide a wide variety of signal processing attributes that are incorporated by its globally diverse customers into numerous end products in the consumer electronics  automotive  mobile pc  desktop pc and industrial markets 
these products generally provide connectivity  networking  or input output control solutions for a variety of high speed communication  computer and related peripheral  consumer electronics  industrial control systems or automotive information applications 
the market for these solutions is increasingly diverse  and the company s technologies are increasingly used in various combinations and in alternative applications 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of sales and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
smsc believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and require critical management 
table of contents judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual future results may differ from these estimates  and to the extent that such differences are material  future reported operating results may be affected 
revenue recognition sales and associated gross profit from shipments to the company s distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are deferred until the distributors resell the products 
shipments to distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are made under agreements allowing price protection and limited rights to return unsold merchandise 
in addition  smsc s shipments to its distributors may be subject from time to time to short term fluctuations as distributors manage their inventories to current levels of end user demand 
therefore  smsc considers the policy of deferring revenue on shipments to distributors to be a more meaningful presentation of the company s operating results  as reported sales are more representative of end user demand 
this policy is a common practice within the semiconductor industry 
the company s revenue recognition is therefore highly dependent upon receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from its distributors 
distributors routinely provide the company with product  price  quantity and end customer data when products are resold  as well as periodic inventory data 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  the company uses this data in reconciling any differences between the distributors reported inventories and shipment activities 
although this information is reviewed and verified for accuracy  any errors or omissions made by the company s distributors and not detected by the company  if material  could affect reported operating results 
shipments made by the company s japanese subsidiary to distributors in japan are made under agreements that permit limited or no stock return or price protection privileges 
smsc recognizes revenue from product sales to distributors in japan  and to original equipment manufacturers oems  as title passes upon delivery  net of appropriate reserves for product returns and allowances 
inventories the company s inventories are comprised of complex  high technology products that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
inventories are valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market  and are reviewed at least quarterly for product obsolescence  excess balances and other indications of impairment in value  based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
when it is determined that specific inventory is stated at a higher value than that which can be recovered  the company writes this inventory down to its estimated realizable value with a charge to costs of goods sold 
while the company endeavors to appropriately forecast customer demand and stock commensurate levels of inventory  unanticipated inventory write downs may be required in future periods relating to inventory on hand as of any reported balance sheet date 
fair value measurements effective march   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas  except as it applies to the non financial assets and non financial liabilities subject to fsp sfas sfas clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measurement of fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company s current fiscal year ended february   except as amended by fasb staff position fsp sfas  which was effective upon adoption during the company s current fiscal year ended february   fsp sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  smsc s fiscal year beginning march   or fiscal and fsp sfas no 
 which was effective upon adoption during the company s current fiscal year ended february  fsp sfas and fsp sfas allow partial adoption relating to fair value measurements for non financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
fsp sfas no 
clarifies the application of sfas no 
in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the company will adopt the remaining provisions of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  and does not anticipate that its adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sfas requires disclosure regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three tiered value hierarchy into which these assets and liabilities must be grouped  based upon significant levels of inputs as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs  other than level prices  such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities  quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
this includes certain pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs 
the lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy 
level assets consist primarily of auction rate securities 
the company estimates the fair value of these investments based on a trinomial discount model 
this model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of the security 
the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auction early redemption  ii failed auction and iii issuer default 
inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include  but are not limited to  the security s collateral  credit rating  insurance  issuer s financial standing  contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market 
the fair value of each security is determined by summing the present value of the probability weighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model 
the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for successful auctions within the aaa rated auction rate securities market 
the expected term was based on management s estimate of future liquidity 
the illiquidity discount was based on the levels of federal insurance or ffelp backing for each security as well as considering similar preferred stock securities ratings and asset backed ratio requirements for each security 
stock based compensation the company has several stock based compensation plans in effect under which incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  restricted stock awards rsas and stock appreciation rights sars are granted to employees and directors 
stock options and sars are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
new shares of common stock are issued in settling stock option exercises and restricted stock awards 
effective march  the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values and does not allow the previously permitted pro forma disclosure only method as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under previous literature 
in march the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance regarding the interaction of sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations 
the company considered the provisions of sab in its adoption of sfas r 
the company elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r 
accordingly  prior periods were not revised to reflect the impact of sfas r 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized includes i compensation cost for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  february  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures  and ii compensation cost for all stock based

r 
in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
r  the company elected the long form method in determining our additional paid in capital pool of windfall benefits and the graded vesting method to amortize compensation expense over the service period 
the estimated value of the company s stock based awards including stock options  restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights  less expected forfeitures  is amortized over the awards respective requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period  on a straight line basis 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the black scholes option pricing model is used for estimating the fair value of options and sars granted and corresponding compensation expense to be recognized 
the black scholes model requires certain assumptions  judgements and estimates by the company to determine fair value  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life 
the company based the expected volatility on historical volatility 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the company based the expected term of options granted using the midpoint scenario  which combines historical exercise data with hypothetical exercise data 
prior to that  the company based expected term of options on an actuarial model 
the expected term of each individual sars award is currently assumed to be the midpoint of the remaining term through expiration as of any remeasurement date 
share based compensation amounts related to rsas is calculated based on the market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
there were no dividends expected to be paid on the company s common stock over the expected lives estimated 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimated losses are based upon historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company regularly performs credit evaluations consisting primarily of reviews of its customers financial condition  using information provided by the customers as well as publicly available information  if any 
if the financial condition of an individual customer or group of customers deteriorates  resulting in such customers inability to make payments within approved credit terms  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and definite lived intangible assets  are monitored and reviewed for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimated cash flows are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to factors such as technological changes  economic conditions  and changes in the company s business model or operating performance 
if at the time of such evaluation the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is below the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 

table of contents indefinite lived intangible assets are also reviewed annually for potential impairment 
as of february   the company had million of trademarks associated with its automotive reporting unit  which was evaluated and deemed recoverable as part of the assessment of related goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment in value annually  as well as when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment in value 
the company performs an annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas  we compared the carrying value of each of our reporting units that existed at those times to their estimated fair value 
for purposes of sfas testing  the company has two reporting units the automotive reporting unit and the analog mixed signal reporting unit 
the automotive unit consists of those portions of the business that were acquired in the march  acquisition of oasis including the infotainment networking technology known as media oriented systems transport most 
the analog mixed signal reporting unit is comprised of most other portions of the business 
the company considered both the market and income approaches in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units  specifically the market multiple methodology and discounted cash flow methodology 
the market multiple methodology involved the utilization of various revenue and cash flow measures at appropriate risk adjusted multiples 
multiples were determined through an analysis of certain publicly traded companies that were selected on the basis of operational and economic similarity with the business operations 
provided these companies meet these criteria  they can be considered comparable from an investment standpoint even if the exact business operations and or characteristics of the entities are not the same 
revenue and ebitda multiples were calculated for the comparable companies based on market data and published financial reports 
a comparative analysis between the company and the public companies deemed to be comparable formed the basis for the selection of appropriate risk adjusted multiples for the company 
the comparative analysis incorporates both quantitative and qualitative risk factors which relate to  among other things  the nature of the industry in which the company and other comparable companies are engaged 
in the discounted cash flow methodology  long term projections prepared by the company were utilized  which were recently revised in light of the current economic environment 
the cash flows projected were analyzed on a debt free basis before cash payments to equity and interest bearing debt investors in order to develop an enterprise value 
a provision  based on these projections  for the value of the company at the end of the forecast period  or terminal value  was also made 
the present value of the cash flows and the terminal value were determined using a risk adjusted rate of return  or discount rate 
upon completion of the fiscal assessment  it was determined that the carrying value of our automotive reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of the analog mixed signal reporting unit exceeded carrying value 
because indicators of impairment existed for the goodwill associated with the automotive reporting unit  we performed the second step of the test required under sfas to determine the fair value of the related goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
to determine the implied value of goodwill  fair values were allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as of february  as part of the second step of the impairment test performed  the company determined the implied fair value of certain long lived intangible assets  including developed technology  customer relationships and trademarks 
current implied fair values of these long lived intangibles were determined to be in excess of net book values as of february  the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities 
the impairment loss for the reporting unit was measured by the amount the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the fair value of the goodwill 
based on this assessment  we recorded a charge of million as of february  refer to part iv item a i financial statements note  for additional information 

table of contents income taxes accounting for income tax obligations requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax effects of differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities as well as tax attributes such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets resulting from these differences must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its forecasts of future taxable income and reviewing available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
at february   the company had million of deferred tax assets net of a valuation allowance of million and million of deferred tax liabilities 
the company s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets and the continuing need for related valuation allowances are monitored on an ongoing basis 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which for smsc  became effective as of march  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin requires that all tax positions be evaluated using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements are recorded as adjustments to income taxes payable or receivable  or adjustments to deferred taxes  or both 
the company adopted fin on march  as a result of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement  the company recognized million of previously unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings 
at adoption the company s total unrecognized tax benefits was stated at million which included million of interest 
legal contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these contingencies require management to assess the likelihood and possible cost of adverse judgments or outcomes 
liabilities for legal contingencies are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
there can be no assurance that any third party assertions against the company will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may subject the company to royalty obligations  product redesigns or discontinuance of products  any of which could adversely impact future profitability 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued three related staff positions i fsp  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp  ii sfas and sfas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp and fsp  and iii sfas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments fsp and apb  which will be effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  smsc s fiscal quarter ending august  
fsp provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities under sfas in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if it were concluded that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value 
in such instances  changes in valuation techniques or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
fsp and fsp modify the requirements for recognizing other than temporarily impaired debt securities and revise the existing impairment model for such securities  by modifying the current intent and ability indicator in determining whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired 
fsp and apb enhance the disclosure of instruments under the 
table of contents scope of sfas for both interim and annual periods 
we are currently evaluating these staff positions  but do not believe their adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities eitf 
eitf addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing net income per share under the two class method described in fasb sfas no 
 earnings per share 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years smsc s fiscal year and fiscal quarter beginning march  
the company has evaluated this eitf and has determined that there will be an immaterial impact on computing net income per share

payment obligations by period total within year between and years between and years thereafter other see below operating leases     other obligations     reserve for uncertain tax positions  inventory and other purchase commitments   total      other obligations include accrued officers and directors retirement obligations and supplier financing obligations 
inventory and other purchase obligations include purchase commitments for processed silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
the company depends entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture its silicon wafers and provide assembly services  as well as for certain of its test services 
due to the length of subcontractor lead times  the company orders these materials and services well in advance  and generally expects to receive and pay for these materials and services within the next six months 
for purposes of the preceding table  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the company cannot cancel these obligations without incurring cost 
non cancelable purchase orders for manufacturing requirements are typically fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons  generally three months or less 
the company has additional purchase orders  not included within the table  that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and investment liquidity risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its investment portfolio ie with respect to interest income 
the primary objective of smsc s investment portfolio management is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  investments are placed with high credit quality issuers and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer is limited 

table of contents as of february   the company s million of long term investments consisted primarily of investments in us government agency backed aaa rated auction rate securities 
from time to time  the company has also held investments in corporate  government and municipal obligations with maturities of between three and twelve months at acquisition 
auction rate securities have long term underlying maturities  but have interest rates that until recently had been reset every days or less at auction  at which time the securities could also typically be repurchased or sold 
in february  the company began to experience failed auctions on some of its auction rate securities based on the failure rate of these auctions  the frequency and extent of the failures  and due to the lack of liquidity in the current market for the auction rate securities  the company determined that the estimated fair value of the auction rate securities no longer approximates par value 
the company used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of these investments as of february   and recorded an unrealized loss of million  net of tax related to the temporary impairment of the auction rate securities  which was included in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
assuming all other assumptions disclosed in part iv item a financial statements note of this report  being equal  an increase or decrease in the liquidity risk premium ie the discount rate of basis points as used in the model would decrease or increase  respectively  the fair value of the auction rate securities by approximately million 
equity price risk the company is not exposed to any equity significant price risks at february  foreign currency risk the company has international operations and is therefore subject to certain foreign currency rate exposures  principally the euro and japanese yen 
the company conducts a significant amount of its business in asia 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  most of the company s product sales and all of its arrangements with its foundry  test and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
the company s most significant foreign subsidiaries  smsc japan and smsc europe  purchase a significant amount of their products for resale in us dollars  and from time to time have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations associated with us dollar liabilities arising from these product purchases and related obligations 
gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset the gains or losses recorded for statutory and us gaap purposes from the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities from us dollars into local currencies 
in fiscal  the company s wholly owned subsidiary in japan initiated two forward contracts for the delivery of million in exchange for yen  to cover scheduled payments on intercompany debt due the us parent company 
an additional forward contract for the purchase of an additional million in exchange for yen was executed during the first quarter of fiscal although these contracts were not formally designated as hedges  they were intended to lock in the settlement rate on the underlying obligations and  as such  effectively mitigated the currency exposure on this intercompany debt 
as of february   these contracts were either settled or expired 
operating activities in europe include transactions conducted in both euros and us dollars 
the euro has been designated as smsc europe s functional currency for its european operations 
from time to time  smsc europe has entered into foreign currency contracts to minimize the exposure of its us dollar denominated transactions  assets and liabilities to currency exchange rate risk 
gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset the gains or losses recorded from the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities from us dollars into euros 
no such contracts were executed during fiscal or during fiscal  and there are no obligations under any such contracts as of february   gains recorded from the remeasurement of us dollar denominated assets and liabilities into euros for fiscal were million  compared with losses of million for fiscal losses recorded from the remeasurement of us dollar denominated assets and liabilities into yen for fiscal were million  compared with gains of million in fiscal the company has taken action in the fourth quarter of fiscal to minimize the impact of such fluctuations going forward  primarily by limiting the amount of us dollar monetary assets held by smsc europe 

table of contents commodity price risk the company routinely uses precious metals in the manufacturing of its products 
supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted  or general market factors and conditions may affect pricing of such commodities 
in the latter part of fiscal  particularly in the fourth quarter  the price of gold increased precipitously  and certain of our supply chain partners began and continue to assess surcharges to compensate for the resultant increase in manufacturing costs 
while the company continues to attempt to mitigate the risk of similar increases in commodities related costs  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully safeguard against potential short term and long term commodities price fluctuations
