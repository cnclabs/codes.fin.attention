we plan to explore new products and services  continue to pursue a disciplined acquisition strategy  enhance our technology and processes and aggressively leverage our brand through thought leadership and intellectual capital projects as a means of delivering world class service to our clients 
during the second half of fiscal global economic conditions significantly deteriorated  which caused a significant decline in the results of our operations 
fee revenue decreased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal  with decreases in fee revenue in all regions 
the north america and europe regions in executive recruitment experienced the largest dollar decreases in fee revenue 
in fiscal  we incurred an operating profit of million with operating income from executive recruitment of million  offset by an operating loss of million from futurestep and corporate expenses of million 
this represents a decrease of over operating income of million in fiscal due to the deteriorating economic conditions  in fiscal we implemented a restructuring of our cost structure designed to reduce our work force by approximately employees and to consolidate premises 
as a result  during fiscal  we recorded a total of million in restructuring charges with million of severance costs related to a reduction in our work force and million relating to the consolidation of premises 
during fiscal our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million  or to million at april  compared to million at april  as of april   we held marketable securities  to settle obligations under the company s executive capital accumulation plan ecap with a cost value of million and a fair value of million 
our working capital increased million in fiscal to million at april  we believe that cash on hand and funds from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 
we had no long term debt or outstanding balance under our credit facility at april  critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded over the performance period for valid engagements and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis and generally bill clients in three monthly installments 
since the fees are generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
any services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is fulfilled 
deferred compensation 
estimating deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding the timing and probability of payments of benefits to participants and the discount rate 
changes in these assumptions would significantly impact the liability and related cost on our balance sheet and statement of operations 
management engages an independent actuary to periodically review these assumptions in order to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects and to assist us in estimating our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual 
table of contents results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets for which management is required to prepare valuations are goodwill  intangible assets and deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as cash flows and profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results 
accounting adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an adjustment was made to correct compensation and benefits expenses that had been recorded twice by the company during the periods covering fiscal through fiscal for expenses relating to employee contributions to flexible spending health benefit accounts 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  the company recorded a cumulative accounting adjustment in the fourth quarter  the effect of which resulted in a million pre tax decrease in compensation and benefits expense  a million increase in cash and cash equivalents and a million increase in accrued compensation and benefits liability 
these adjustments increased operating profit by million and decreased net loss by million  or per basic and diluted share for the three months and year ended april  the correction of the error was not material to any individual prior period or the current period and  accordingly  the prior period results have not been adjusted

dividends received from the company s unconsolidated subsidiaries equaled million in fiscal  and are reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of our investment 
liquidity and capital resources the operating environment for the company s suite of services deteriorated rapidly in the second half of fiscal in response to the uncertain economic environment and labor markets  the company has taken steps to align its cost structure with anticipated revenue levels  in an effort to retain positive cash flow 
continued adverse changes in the company s revenue  however  could require us to institute additional cost cutting measures  and to the extent our efforts are not quick or deep enough  we may incur negative cash flows  which if persist  would require us to obtain additional financing to meet our needs 
the company believes that the cash on hand and funds from 
table of contents operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate requirements during the next twelve months 
our performance is subject to the general level of economic activity in the geographic regions and industries in which we operate 
the economic activity in those regions and industries have recently deteriorated significantly and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
if the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general were to deteriorate further in the future  it is possible that such changes could put additional negative pressure on demand for our services and affect our cash flows 
as of april   we held marketable securities to settle obligations under the ecap with a cost value of million and a fair value of million 
the difference between cost and fair value has previously been recorded as an unrealized loss in our statement of stockholders equity 
as a result of the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of these securities the company recorded a million asset impairment charge during the third fiscal quarter ended january  in the statement of operations in interest and other loss income  net 
because the impaired assets mirror liabilities to participants which were previously adjusted to the market value of the assets  this non cash charge did not impact the company s operations  operating income or liquidity 
on april   considering the increase in investment activity and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  the company transferred certain securities previously classified as available for sale to trading 
the securities were transferred at fair value on april   which became the new cost basis of the securities 
unrealized gains of million at the date of the transfer were reversed from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the statement of operations 
as of april  we held approximately million par value with a fair value of million of marketable securities investments  classified as noncurrent assets  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
continued liquidity issues in the global credit markets caused auctions for all of our auction rate securities to fail because the amount of securities offered for sale exceeded the amount of bids 
as a result  the liquidity of our remaining auction rate securities has diminished 
we expect this decreased liquidity will continue for as long as the present depressed global credit market environment persists  or until issuers refinance and replace these securities with other instruments 
despite the current auction market  we believe the credit quality of our auction rate securities remains high due to the creditworthiness of the issuers 
we continue to collect interest when due and at this time we expect to continue to do so going forward 
additionally  we expect we will receive the principal balance through either future successful auctions  sales of these securities outside the auction process  the issuers establishment of different form of financing to replace these securities  or the maturing of the securities 
in august we received notification from one of our investment securities firms investment firm announcing a proposed settlement to repurchase all of our auction rate security holdings at par value 
we formally accepted the settlement agreement and entered into a repurchase agreement agreement with the investment firm on october  acceptance date 
by accepting the agreement  we received the right put option to sell our auction rate securities at par value to the investment firm between june  and july  and gave the investment firm the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after the acceptance date as long as we receive the par value 
the agreement covers million par value fair value of of our auction rate securities as of april  and we expect to receive the entire par value upon the future liquidation of the securities 
the net increase in our working capital of million in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to decreases in accrued compensation and benefits payable  income taxes payable and accounts payable  offset to some extent by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
compensation and benefits payable decreased due to a reduction in worldwide headcount and a reduction in profitability based compensation 
accounts receivable declined due to the decrease in the number of engagements billed plus lower average fees billed per engagement in all regions cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately million and million as of april  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash and highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
marketable securities consist of auction rate municipal 
table of contents securities  equity securities and fixed income mutual funds 
the primary objectives for these investments are liquidity or to meet the obligations under certain of our deferred compensation plans 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  a decrease of million  from cash provided in operating activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash used in operating activities is primarily due to a million decrease in net income  a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a million decrease in accrued liabilities related to deferred compensation retirement plans and other retirement plans 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is attributable mainly to a reduction in worldwide headcount and profitability based compensation 
offsetting these amounts are decreases in accounts receivable  which resulted in cash flows from operations of million over the prior year 
the decrease in revenues resulted from the global economic and financial crisis  which led to deteriorating labor markets throughout the world and had a resulting dampening effect on demand for our services 
in addition  as a result of the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value of marketable securities the company recorded a million other than temporary asset impairment charge in fiscal  offset by million of unrealized gains reclassified to other income upon the transfer of available for sale securities to trading  both of which did not occur in fiscal cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million cash used in the prior year 
for the year ended april   the increase in cash used was primarily attributable to million of marketable securities purchased in fiscal compared to sales of million in fiscal cash used to acquire lore international institute  inc during the fiscal year was million  an increase in cash used for acquisition of million over prior year 
the increase in cash used for the purchase of marketable securities and acquisitions was partially offset by a decrease in spending on capital expenditures million  which was due to the decline in operations during fiscal cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  a million decrease from fiscal in the current fiscal year  we repurchased million of common stock  to buy back approximately million shares of common stock and in fiscal we repurchased million of common stock  to buy back million shares of common stock 
as of april   million remained available for repurchase under our repurchase program  which was approved by the board of directors 
the company does not intend to repurchase additional shares for the foreseeable future 
these repurchases were offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of million and million in the fiscal and  respectively  due in part to a decline in the number stock options exercised and a decline in the number of shares purchased through our employee stock purchase plan 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements and have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities

revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r expands the definition of transactions and events that qualify as business combinations  requires that the acquired assets and liabilities including contingencies and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  be recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter be reflected in earnings  rather than goodwill  changes the recognition timing for restructuring costs  and requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating activities  we are exposed to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading  hedging or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk 
substantially all our foreign subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the reporting period 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity s functional currency may give rise to transaction gains and losses that impact our results of operations 
historically  we have not realized significant foreign currency gains or losses on such transactions 
during the year ended april   we recognized foreign currency losses  before income taxes  of million primarily related to our emea and asia pacific operations 
our primary exposure to exchange losses is based on outstanding intercompany loan balances denominated in us dollars 
if the us dollar strengthened  and against the pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  our exchange loss would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  if the us dollar weakened by the same increments against pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  our exchange gain would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  interest rate risk 
we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities  which generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
as of april   we had no outstanding balance on our credit facility 
we have million of borrowings against the cash surrender value of coli contracts as of april  bearing interest primarily at variable rates 
the risk of fluctuations in these variable 
table of contents rates is minimized by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate on the cash surrender value on our coli contracts 
as of april   we held approximately million par value fair valued of million of auction rate securities 
continued liquidity issues in the global credit markets caused auctions for all of our auction rate securities to fail  and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 
as a result of the current situation in the auction markets  our ability to liquidate our investment in auction rate securities and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or impossible 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities cannot 
if in the future the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investment without significant loss within the next year  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
equity risk 
as of april   we held marketable securities to settle obligations under the ecap with a cost value of million and a fair value of million 
the difference between cost and fair value has previously been recorded as an unrealized loss in our statement of stockholders equity 
as a result of the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of these securities the company recorded a million asset impairment charge during the third fiscal quarter ended january  in the statement of operations in interest and other loss income  net 
because the impaired assets mirror liabilities to participants which were previously adjusted to the market value of the assets  this non cash charge did not impact the company s operations  operating income or liquidity 
on april   subsequent to the asset impairment charge and in accordance with sfas  the company transferred certain securities previously classified as available for sale to trading 
the securities were transferred at fair value on april   which became the new cost basis of the securities 
unrealized gains of million at the date of the transfer were reversed from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the statement of operations
