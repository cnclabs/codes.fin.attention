our management has chosen not to use hedge accounting for these arrangements 
for the years ended december     and we have classified the gains and losses both realized and unrealized on derivatives to other income expense in the statements of operations 
we feel that this presentation fairly presents revenues derived from operations because the gains and losses on derivatives are comprised of a significant unrealized gain or loss for future periods which is not reflective of current operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis that follows should be read together with item  selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and notes related thereto that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
it includes forward looking statements that may reflect our estimates  beliefs  plans and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are based upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas and oil  regulatory changes  estimates of proved reserves  economic conditions  competitive conditions  development success rates  capital expenditures and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  including in item a  risk factors  all of which are difficult to predict 
as a result of these assumptions  risks and uncertainties  the forward looking matters discussed may not occur 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  exploration and development of domestic onshore natural gas reserves 
we primarily focus our efforts on the development of cbm properties located in the powder river basin in northeastern wyoming and southern montana 
in addition  in april  we acquired properties located in the green river basin in southern wyoming 
as of december   we owned natural gas and oil leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres  approximately of which were undeveloped 
as of december   we had estimated net proved reserves of approximately bcf based on the year end cig index price of per mcf 
we had a total capital expenditure budget of million for and expected to drill gross net wells during the period 
however  due to low cig index prices  the economic climate and limited capital resources  we reduced our capital expenditure budget resulting in actual capital expenditures of million 
in connection with our reduced capital expenditure budget  we also reduced our drilling and completion targets for and drilled gross net wells 
we curtailed substantially all new drilling in the fourth quarter of  and have shut in a number of wells that are not economic at current natural gas price levels 
if natural gas prices remain low  we expect to continue to operate with a reduced capital expenditure plan 
under our reduced capital expenditure plan  we would generally make such expenditures only as necessary to secure drilling permits in strategic areas  drill wells that secure leasehold positions and construct the necessary infrastructure to complete and hook up wells that have already been drilled 
our capital expenditure budget for will be dependent upon cig index prices  our cash flows and the availability of additional capital resources 
we were formed in june as a delaware corporation through a contribution of proved producing properties and undeveloped leaseholds by subsidiaries of carrizo and us energy and a cash contribution from dlj merchant banking 
in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to qualified institutional buyers  non us persons and accredited investors 
in may  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock 
please see the information under the heading liquidity and capital resources cash flow from financing activities in this item for further information regarding issuances of equity to our initial stockholders 
shares of our common stock are traded on the nasdaq global market under the symbol pinn 

table of contents significant developments credit facility and liquidity 
on april  we and the lenders entered into the fourth amendment to the credit facility which waived compliance with the current ratio financial covenant as of december  and march  and with the restrictive covenants related to accounts payable  permitted liens and permitted debt until the next borrowing base redetermination expected in the fall of  subject to certain financial caps 
in connection with the waiver of the restrictive covenants  the lenders reduced our borrowing base to million  with further monthly reductions until the borrowing base reaches million on october  we believe that we may not be in compliance with certain restrictive covenants throughout  but will seek additional waivers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such waivers or that such waivers will be obtained on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to obtain future waivers and or to comply with the restrictive covenants  the lenders could accelerate our indebtedness under the credit facility or foreclose on properties held by liens 
we have remained in compliance with the payment of principal and interest pertaining to the credit facility including ensuring that our outstanding borrowings remain within the limitations of the borrowing base 
due to borrowing base limitations and waiver stipulations  we are currently unable to incur additional indebtedness under the credit facility 
in accordance with accounting guidance  we have classified all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility totaling million as of december  as a current payable because it is unlikely that we will have cured the noncompliance of certain restrictive covenants during the next months 
we have further reduced our outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility to million as of april  in order to be in compliance with the new borrowing base limitation 
we are actively marketing certain assets to raise additional capital and are also reviewing alternatives for raising additional capital through equity and debt financing  capital restructuring and possible mergers 
we sold our high pressure gas gathering system in our cabin creek project area in wyoming and our remaining interest in the arvada project area in wyoming in april management believes that appropriate steps  including cost cutting measures  are being taken to make operations sustainable in the future 
although we are pursuing various alternatives to provide additional liquidity  there is no assurance of the likelihood or timing of any of these transactions 
economic and natural gas pricing environment 
during  the global economy experienced a significant downturn 
the downturn  which began over concerns related to the us financial markets  spread to other industries which included the energy industry 
the initial affects of the downturn restricted the capital and credit markets to a degree that has not been seen in a number of decades in the united states 
we have been able to partially mitigate the constraints imposed by the current economic climate through utilization of our credit facility and cash flows from operations 
the fear of global recession led to an immediate drop in demand for natural gas  primarily by industrial users  which in turn led to a significant reduction in natural gas prices 
the natural gas index price in the rocky mountain region averaged per mcf for the first eight months of but only per mcf for the last four months of this decrease in price has caused us to reevaluate our business plan 
we have curtailed drilling except for wells that will hold significant blocks of acreage 
we have reduced administrative  operating and transportation costs 
even with cost reductions and a flexible capital spending budget  the current natural gas pricing and economic environment remains challenging 
we are exploring strategic alternatives to increase our capital resources 
supplemental environmental impact statement 
a record of decision for the seis covering federal lands in the powder river basin in montana was signed by the blm on december  this record of decision removed the injunction on drilling on federal leases in montana  which impacted approximately  gross  net acres of our leasehold position 
we are evaluating our future plans of development in montana 

table of contents critical accounting policies the most subjective and complex judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are reserve evaluation and determination  estimates of the timing and cost of our future drilling activity  estimates of the fair valuation of hedges in place  estimates of timing and cost of asset retirement obligations  estimates of the expense and timing of exercise of stock options  accruals of operating costs  capital expenditures and revenue  and estimates for litigation 
oil and gas properties we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
under this method  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development  including costs of unsuccessful exploration  costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals and the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement and abandonment activities  are capitalized within a cost center 
our oil and gas properties are all located within the united states  which constitutes a single cost center 
we capitalize certain lease operating expenses associated with exploration and development of unevaluated oil and gas properties 
no gain or loss is recognized upon the sale or abandonment of undeveloped or producing oil and gas properties unless the sale represents a significant portion of gas properties and the gain significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and proved gas reserves of the cost center 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to lease operating expense in the period incurred 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties is computed on the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
amortizable costs include estimates of future development costs of proved undeveloped reserves and asset retirement obligations 
we invest in unevaluated oil and gas properties for the purpose of exploration for proved reserves 
the costs of such assets  including exploration costs on properties where a determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves will be established is still under evaluation  and any capitalized interest and lease operating expenses  are included in unproved oil and gas properties at the lower of cost or estimated fair market value and are not subject to amortization 
on a quarterly basis  such costs are evaluated for inclusion in the costs to be amortized resulting from the determination of proved reserves  impairments  or reductions in value 
to the extent that the evaluation indicates these properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
we recorded an impairment of unevaluated properties of million  million and as of december    and  respectively 
abandonment of unproved properties is also accounted for as an adjustment to capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  with no losses recognized 
substantially all remaining unproved property costs are expected to be developed and included in the amortization base ratably over the next three to five years 
salvage value is taken into account in determining depletion rates and is based on our estimate of the value of equipment and supplies at the time the well is abandoned 
the estimated salvage value of equipment included in determining the depletion rate was million  million and million as of december    and  respectively 
under the full cost method of accounting rules  capitalized costs less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling value which is the sum of the present 
table of contents value discounted at of estimated future net revenue using current costs and prices  including the effects of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges but excluding the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  less any related income tax effects  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of costs or estimated fair value of unproved properties  less the income tax effects related to differences in the book to tax basis of oil and gas properties 
this is referred to as the full cost ceiling limitation 
if capitalized costs exceed the limit  the excess must be charged to expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods 
at the end of each quarter  we calculate the full cost ceiling limitation 
at december   the capitalized cost of our oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately million based upon a natural gas price of approximately per mcf in effect at that date 
an impairment of approximately million was therefore recorded in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a total impairment for the year ended december  of approximately million 
the impairment of our oil and gas properties resulted from low commodity prices in the fourth quarter of based on the cig index price of per mcf on april   we would have been required to take a total impairment of approximately million at december  a decline in gas prices or an increase in operating costs or reductions in economically recoverable quantities could result in the recognition of additional impairments of our oil and gas properties in future periods 
gas sales we use the sales method for recording natural gas sales 
sales of gas applicable to our interest in producing natural gas and oil leases are recorded as revenues when the gas is metered and title transferred pursuant to the gas sales contracts covering our interest in gas reserves 
during such times as our sales of gas exceed our pro rata ownership in a well  such sales are recorded as revenues unless total sales from the well have exceeded our share of estimated total gas reserves underlying the property at which time such excess is recorded as a gas imbalance liability 
at december   and  no such liability was recorded 
although there was no liability recorded for prior periods  gas reserves are an estimate and are updated on an annual and interim basis 
gas pricing  expenses and production may impact future gas reserves remaining which in turn  could impact the recording of liabilities in the future 
gas sales accruals at december   and were based on the actual volume statements from our purchasers and distribution process 
if accruals were to change by at year end  the impact would have been a  change for  a  change for and a  change for asset retirement obligations we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
generally applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas no 
requires us to recognize an estimated liability for costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties 
a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long lived asset is recorded at the time a well is completed or acquired 
the increased carrying value is depleted using the units of production method  and the discounted liability is increased through accretion over the remaining life of the respective oil and gas properties 
the estimated liability is based on historical gas industry experience in abandoning wells  including estimated economic lives  external estimates as to the cost to abandon the wells in the future and federal and state regulatory requirements 
our liability is discounted using our best estimate of our credit adjusted risk free rate 
revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimated abandonment costs  changes in well economic lives or if federal or state regulators enact new 
table of contents requirements regarding the abandonment of wells 
for example  a change in our estimated retirement costs would have a  effect on our asset retirement obligation liability at december  the following is a summary of our asset retirement obligation activity for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  beginning balance of asset retirement obligations additional obligations added during the period obligations settled during the period revisions in estimates accretion expense ending balance of asset retirement obligations inventory we have acquired inventory of oil and gas equipment  primarily tubulars  to take advantage of quantity pricing and to secure a readily available supply 
inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market 
inventory is used in the development of gas properties and to the extent it is estimated that it will be billed to other working interest owners during the next year  it is included in current assets 
otherwise  it is recorded in non current assets 
the price of steel is a primary factor in valuing our inventory 
under the valuation method of lower of average cost or market  a reduction in the price of steel would have caused a  reduction in our inventory valuation as of december  the market price of steel is evaluated each quarter using prices quoted by authorized vendors in the area 
property and equipment property and equipment is comprised primarily of a building  computer hardware and software  vehicles and equipment  and is recorded at cost 
renewals and betterments that substantially extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized 
maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging as follows buildings years  computer hardware and software to years  machinery  equipment and vehicles years  and office furniture and equipment to years 
long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used in our business are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when the carrying amounts of long lived assets exceed the fair value  which is generally based on discounted expected future cash flows  we record an impairment 
no impairments were recorded during the years ended december   and general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are reported net of amounts allocated and billed to working interest owners of gas properties operated by us 
the administrative expenses billed to working interest owners may change in accordance with the terms of the joint operating agreements 
administrative expenses are charged to working interest owners based on productive well counts 
a change in well counts for the year ended december  would have increased or decreased our expenses 
table of contents billed to working interest owners by approximately  as we operate and drill additional wells in the future  additional administrative expenses will be charged to the working interest owners when the wells become productive 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  also include million of merger related costs attributable to the failed merger with quest resource corporation 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
if appropriate  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which reflects expectations of the extent to which such assets will be realized 
as of december   and  we had recorded a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset 
on january   we adopted the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires that we recognize in our consolidated financial statements only those tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained as of the adoption date  based on the technical merits of the position 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we performed a comprehensive review of our material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by fin as a result of this review  we did not identify any material deferred tax assets that required adjustment 
as of december  and we had not recorded any material uncertain tax benefits 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense 
as of december   and  we have not recognized any interest or penalties in our statement of operations or statement of financial position 
we are subject to the following material taxing jurisdictions us federal 
we also have material operations in the state of wyoming  however  wyoming does not impose a corporate income tax 
the tax years that remain open to examination by the us internal revenue service are years through due to our net operating loss carry forwards  the internal revenue service may also adjust the amount of loss realizable under examination back to derivatives we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuating natural gas prices through the use of natural gas swap and option contracts 
we account for derivative instruments or hedging activities under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires us to record derivative instruments at their fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges  if any  are recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment are recognized in earnings 
please see note of the notes to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report for additional discussion of derivatives 

table of contents we periodically hedge a portion of our oil and gas production through swap and collar agreements 
the purpose of the hedges is to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage the exposure to commodity price risk 
our management decided not to use hedge accounting for these agreements 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payments  which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for share based payments based on the estimated fair value of the awards 
sfas no 
r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized for stock awards and options excess tax benefits be presented as financing cash inflows in the statement of cash flows 
under sfas no 
r  compensation expense for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the estimated grant date fair value  has been recorded in each of the years ended december   and we record compensation expense related to non employees under the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services and recognize compensation expense over the vesting periods of such awards 
as required by sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we have computed the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
in order to calculate the fair value of the options  certain assumptions are made regarding components of the model  including risk free interest rate  volatility  expected dividend yield  and expected option life 
changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to valuation 
for options granted before january   expected volatility was not considered because we were a private company at the grant date of these options 
for stock option grants after january   we used a volatility rate of and began to include estimated forfeiture rates 
we estimated the volatility rate of our common stock at the date of the grant based on the historical volatility of comparable companies 
we factored in expected retention rates combined with vesting periods to determine the average expected life 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
no options were granted during the year ended december  year ended december  expected volatility n a dividend yield n a risk free interest rate n a to to weighted average expected life in years n a accounts receivable our revenue producing activities are conducted primarily in wyoming 
we grant credit to qualified customers  which potentially subjects us to credit risk resulting from  among other factors  adverse changes in the industry in which we operate and the financial condition of our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and  if necessary  record an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
we recorded an allowance of  as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents transportation costs we account for transportation costs under emerging issues task force issues  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  whereby amounts paid for transportation are classified as operating expenses 
legal estimates from time to time  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we account for these costs under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which states that a loss contingency be recorded if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and it is reasonably estimatable 
at december  and  we recorded  and  respectively  for legal proceedings 
per share information basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period 
diluted earnings per share is computed by adjusting the average number of common shares outstanding for the dilutive effect  if any  of common stock equivalents such as stock options and warrants 
diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for all periods presented because potential common stock equivalents were anti dilutive 
for all periods in which there was a net loss attributable to stockholders  all of our stock options and warrants were anti dilutive 
common stock equivalents of   and  at december    and  respectively  were excluded because they were anti dilutive due to the net loss attributable to stockholders incurred in such periods 
recent accounting pronouncements for information concerning recent accounting pronouncements  please see note of the notes to the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
trends affecting our business the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system have had an adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
in addition  prices of oil and natural gas have dropped significantly at the end of as a result of low cig index prices  the economic climate and limited capital resources  we reduced our capital expenditure budget and drilling and completion targets 
we curtailed substantially all new drilling in the fourth quarter of  and shut in a number of non economic wells 
if natural gas prices remain low  we expect to continue to operate with a reduced capital expenditure plan 
under such plan  we would generally make such expenditures only as necessary to secure drilling permits in strategic areas  drill wells that secure leasehold positions and construct the necessary infrastructure to complete and hook up wells that have already been drilled 
we have also experienced increasing costs since our inception in due to increased demand for oilfield products and services 
the cyclical nature of the natural gas industry causes fluctuations in demand for goods and services from oilfield companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry  which in turn affects the prices for those goods and services 
typically  as prices for natural gas increase  so do all the costs associated with natural gas production 
the decline in natural gas prices and the general economy  beginning in the fourth quarter of  have curtailed drilling and development of coalbed methane properties in our area 
the resulting decrease in demand for drilling rigs  cement  and tubulars has resulted in a decrease in the cost of these goods and services 

table of contents historically  natural gas prices have been extremely volatile  and we expect that volatility to continue 
for example  during the year ended december   the nymex natural gas index price ranged from a high of per mmbtu to a low of per mmbtu  while the cig natural gas index price ranged from a high of per mmbtu to a low of per mmbtu 
during the year ended december   the nymex natural gas index price ranged from a high of per mmbtu to a low of per mmbtu  while the cig natural gas index price ranged from a high of per mmbtu to a low of per mmbtu 
changes in natural gas pricing have impacted our revenue streams  production taxes  prices used in reserve calculations  borrowing base calculations and the carrying value of our properties and the valuation of potential property acquisitions 
during the years ended december   and  estimated future gas prices had an impact on both our revenues and the costs attributable to our future operations 
we expect that changing natural gas prices will continue to impact our operations and financial results in the future 
transportation of natural gas and access to throughput capacity have a direct impact on natural gas prices in the rocky mountain region  where our operations are concentrated 
as drilling activity increases throughout the rocky mountain region  additional production may come on line  which could cause bottlenecks or capacity constraints 
generally speaking  a surplus of natural gas production relative to available transportation capacity has a negative impact on prices 
conversely  as capacity increases  and bottlenecks are eliminated  prices generally increase 
although there is currently adequate transportation capacity out of the powder river basin  a surplus of natural gas arriving at key marketing hubs from the powder river basin and elsewhere relative to available takeaway capacity from these hubs has caused rocky mountain gas to generally trade at a discount to the nymex natural gas index price 
for example  from january  through december   rocky mountain gas traded at a differential to the nymex natural gas index price that ranged from a premium of to a discount of  with an average differential of a discount of 
the rockies express pipeline which was completed and placed into service in early  has increased takeaway capacity by approximately bcf per day from these hubs 
we expect that the completion of additional proposed pipelines will help reduce the differential between gas produced in the rocky mountain region and the nymex natural gas index price 
additional proposed pipelines are scheduled to be completed in late and general economic conditions and the future demand for natural gas may change the development schedule of proposed pipelines 
results of operations net loss attributable to stockholders for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  on total revenues of million 
other income for the year ended december  included a million unrealized gain associated with the change in the fair valuation of our natural gas hedges in place in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
absent such change in the valuation of hedges  we would have shown a loss of million 
this compares to a net loss attributable to stockholders of million for the year ended december  on total revenue of million 
adjusted for an unrealized loss in the fair valuation of our natural gas hedges in place of million shown in other income  our results for the year ended december  would have been a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million 
in order to provide a measure of stability to the cash flow in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage the exposure to commodity price risk  we chose to periodically hedge a portion of our oil and gas production using swap and collar agreements 
we account for our derivative instruments under the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires us to record derivative instruments at their fair value 
management has chosen not to use hedge accounting for these arrangements 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 changes in the fair market value are recognized in earnings 

table of contents for the year ended december   the gains and losses both realized and unrealized on derivatives were reported in total revenues in the statements of operations 
for the years ended december   and  we have reclassified the gains and losses both realized and unrealized on derivatives to other income expense in the statements of operations 
we believe that this presentation more fairly presents revenues derived from operations because the gains and losses on derivatives are comprised of a significant unrealized gain or loss for future periods which is not reflective of current operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gas sales volume 
gas sales volume increased from  mmcf in the year ended december  to  mmcf in the year ended december  daily sales volume averaged mmcf for the year ended december  as compared to mmcf for the year ended december   a mmcf per day increase 
the increase was primarily due to production coming online in our cabin creek  kirby and deer creek project areas 
although volumes increased in overall  our volumes were reduced by approximately mmcf per day from september  through december  due to low natural gas pricing  weather interruptions and pipeline flow interruptions due to hydrostatic testing 
gas sales revenue 
revenue from gas sales increased million in the year ended december  to million  a increase compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in the average realized price per mcf during the first three quarters of  compared to average prices in  along with increased gas sales volume 
the average realized price per mcf increased  from per mcf in the year ended december  to per mcf in the year ended december  derivatives 
for the year ended december   we had an unrealized gain of million compared to an unrealized loss of million for the year ended december  the unrealized gain is noncash income based primarily on the black scholes model for valuing future cash flows utilizing price volatility with a normal discount rate for our costless collars in place and an intrinsic model for our swaps in place 
hedges settled in the year ended december  resulted in a realized gain of million compared to hedge gains of million in the year ended december  the hedge gains were primarily due to the fact that gas prices were lower than our weighted average floor price of our hedges in place 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased million in the year ended december  to million  a increase compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted from an increase in the number of wells in the productive cycle during  along with a workover program which replaced or repaired pumps  increased generator rental and diesel fuel costs  and increased water treatment costs in our cabin creek area 
on an mcf basis  lease operating expenses increased from per mcf in the year ended december  to per mcf in the year ended december  the increase per mcf was primarily due to a number of wells being in the early stages of their productive life cycle as production did not increase proportionately to the number of wells coming online 
increases in generator rental and associated fuel costs while waiting on permanent power and increased water management costs associated with water treatment in our cabin creek area also contributed to our higher lease operating expenses 

table of contents production taxes 
production taxes increased million in the year ended december  to million  a increase from the year ended december  the increase in production taxes was directly correlated to gross sales revenue because production taxes in wyoming and montana are based on a percentage of sales value 
the percentage averages to  depending on rates in effect for the respective year in wyoming and in montana 
the increase in production taxes was partially offset by a surplus of ad valorem taxes over withheld from through based on the estimated mill levy rate compared to the actual rate 
on an mcf basis  production taxes were per mcf for the year ended december  and per mcf for the year ended december   a increase  which correlates to the increase in the price per mcf received in from partially offset by the ad valorem tax surplus netted against the expense 
marketing and transportation 
marketing and transportation expenses increased million in the year ended december  to million  a increase from the year ended december  the increase related primarily to the increased sales volume in together with a slight increase in transportation fees and compression due to inflationary adjustments in the applicable contracts along with additional compression  which enabled us to move gas on additional high pressure transportation systems and fees for compression design capacity which was not used 
on an mcf basis  marketing and transportation expenses increased to per mcf in the year ended december  from per mcf in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses  net 
general and administrative expenses are offset by operating income from drilling and production activities for which we can charge an overhead fee to nonoperating working interest owners 
these well operating overhead fees were million in the year ended december   a increase 
general and administrative expenses  net increased million in the year ended december  to million from million in the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a million charge related to merger costs attributable to the failed quest resource corporation merger  which was partially offset by cost saving measures  including staff reductions  that we implemented in late on an mcf basis  general and administrative expenses  net increased  from per mcf in the year ended december  to per mcf in the year ended december  absent the million merger related charges  general and administrative expenses would have been per mcf for the year period ended december  depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expense increased million for the year ended december  to million  a increase compared to the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in capital expenditures that were added into the full cost pool used for the computation of depletion  as well as increased production 
on an mcf basis  the depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion rate increased to per mcf in the year ended december  from per mcf in the year ended december  impairment 
at december   the capitalized cost of our oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately million based upon a natural gas price of approximately per mcf based on the cig index in effect at that date 
the full impairment was taken in the fourth quarter of this compares to a million impairment which was primarily taken in the first 
table of contents quarter of for further information regarding this impairment  please see note in the notes to the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
a decline in natural gas prices or an increase in operating costs subsequent to the measurement date or reductions in economically recoverable quantities could result in the recognition of additional impairments of our oil and gas properties in future periods 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gas sales volume 
gas sales volume increased  from  mmcf in the year ended december  to  mmcf in the year ended december  daily sales volume averaged mmcf for the year ended december  as compared to mmcf for the year ended december   a mmcf per day increase 
the increase was primarily due to production coming online in our cabin creek  kirby and deer creek project areas 
gas sales revenue 
revenue from gas sales increased million during the year ended december   to million  an increase compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in gas sales volume which was partially offset by a decrease in the average realized price per mcf 
the average realized price per mcf decreased  from per mcf in the year ended december  to per mcf in the year ended december  derivatives 
for the year ended december   we had an unrealized loss of million compared to an unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  the unrealized loss is a noncash expense based primarily on the black scholes model for valuing future cash flows utilizing price volatility with a normal discount rate 
hedges settled in the year ended december  resulted in a realized gain of million compared to a hedge gain of million in the year ended december  the hedge gains were primarily due to the fact that gas prices were lower than the weighted average floor price of our hedges in place 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased million in the year ended december  to million  a increase compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted from an increase in the number of wells in the productive cycle during the year ended december  on an mcf basis  lease operating expenses increased from per mcf in the year ended december  to per mcf in the year ended december  the increase per mcf was primarily due to a number of wells being in the early stages of their productive life cycle as production did not increase proportionately to the number of wells coming online 
increases in generator rental and associated fuel costs while waiting on permanent power and increased water management costs associated with water treatment also contributed to our higher operating expenses 
production taxes 
production taxes increased million in the year ended december  to million  a increase from the year ended december  production taxes generally correlate to gross sales revenue because production taxes are based on a percentage of sales value 
in wyoming  the percentage averages to  depending on rates in effect for the respective year 
the increase in production taxes for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased revenues associated with increased volume and a slight increase in county tax rates in wyoming 
on an mcf 
table of contents basis  production taxes were per mcf for the year ended december  and per mcf for the year ended december   an decrease  which correlates to the decrease in the price per mcf received in the year ended december  from the year ended december  marketing and transportation 
marketing and transportation expenses increased million in the year ended december  to million  a increase from the year ended december  the increase related primarily to increased sales volume in the year ended december   together with a slight increase in transportation fees and compression due to inflationary adjustments in the contracts along with fees paid for compression design capacity which was not used 
on an mcf basis  marketing and transportation expenses increased to per mcf in the year ended december  from per mcf in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses  net 
general and administrative expenses are offset by operating income from drilling and production activities for which we can charge an overhead fee to nonoperating working interest owners 
these well operating overhead fees increased to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   due to increased productive wells which we operate and for which we charge an overhead fee 
general and administrative expenses  net increased million in the year ended december  to million from million in the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase in payroll expenses due to the hiring of additional employees during the year ended december  on an mcf basis  general and administrative expenses  net decreased from per mcf in the year ended december  to per mcf in the year ended december  depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expense decreased million for the year ended december  to million  a decrease compared to the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decrease in the full cost pool due to the impairments recorded in coupled with higher year end reserves at december  compared to december  on an mcf basis  the depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion rate decreased to per mcf in the year ended december  from per mcf in the year ended december  impairment 
at december   the full cost ceiling of our oil and gas properties exceeded the capitalized cost basis by approximately million  based upon a natural gas price of approximately per mcf in effect at that date 
an impairment was recorded for the nine months ended september  of approximately million  resulting in a total impairment for the year ended december  of approximately million 
the impairment of our oil and gas properties resulted from low commodity prices throughout the year 
for further information regarding this impairment  please see note of the notes to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources in the past  our primary sources of liquidity have been private and public sales of our equity securities  cash provided by operating activities  and debt financing 
all of these sources have been negatively impacted by the current economic climate  its impact on our industry  and by significant 
table of contents fluctuations in oil and gas prices  operating costs  and volumes produced 
we have no control over the market prices for oil and natural gas  although we are able to influence the amount of our net realized revenues related to gas sales through the use of derivative contracts 
a decrease in market prices would reduce expected cash flow from operating activities and could reduce the borrowing base of our credit facility as well as the value of assets we might consider selling 
historically  decreases in market prices have limited our industry s access to the capital markets 
during these challenging times  we have reduced our administrative  operating and transportation costs 
we are also actively marketing asset sales and exploring other strategic alternatives and capital restructuring options 
sales of equity 
in april  we completed a private placement of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  or net of the initial purchaser s discount and placement fee 
in may  we completed an initial public offering of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  or net of the underwriters discounts and commissions 
please see the information under the heading cash flow from financing activities in this item credit facility 
effective february   we entered into a credit facility which permits borrowings up to the borrowing base as designated by the administrative agent 
as of december  and march   we had million and million  respectively  of debt outstanding under the facility 
as described below  we are currently unable to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility due to covenant limitations and may be further limited in the future based on borrowing base limitations 
as of december   the borrowing base under the credit facility was approximately million 
the borrowing base was subject to automatic reductions of approximately  per month until it reached million on april  as of april   our borrowing base was reduced to million  subject to automatic reductions of  per month until it reaches million on october  where it will remain until the next borrowing base redetermination 
if natural gas prices do not improve  we expect that our borrowing base could be further reduced in the future 
the borrowing base is determined on a semi annual basis and at such other additional times  up to twice yearly  as may be requested by either us or the administrative agent and is determined by the administrative agent in accordance with customary practices and standards for loans of a similar nature  although such determination is at the administrative agent s discretion as the credit agreement does not provide a specific borrowing base formula 
borrowings under this credit facility may be used solely to acquire  explore or develop oil and gas properties and for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility matures february  our obligations under the credit facility are secured by liens on i no less than of the net present value of the oil and gas to be produced from our oil and gas properties that are included in the borrowing base determination  calculated using a discount rate of per annum and reserve estimates  prices and production rates and costs  ii options to lease  seismic options  permits  and records related to such properties  and iii seismic data 
borrowings under our credit facility  as amended  bear interest either i at the greater of the one month london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus or a domestic bank rate  plus in either case an applicable margin of to based on utilization  or ii on a sliding scale from the one  two  three or six month libor  plus an applicable margin of to based on utilization 
the credit agreement provides for various fees  including a quarterly commitment fee of per annum and engineering fees to the administrative agent in connection with a borrowing base determination 
in addition  the credit facility provided for an up front fee of  which was paid on the closing date of the credit facility  and an additional arrangement fee of based on utilization 

table of contents borrowings under this credit facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty  except on eurodollar advances 
the credit agreement  as amended  contains covenants that among other things restrict our ability subject to certain exceptions to do the following incur liens  incur debt  make investments in other persons  declare dividends or redeem or repurchase stock  engage in mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and asset sales or amend our organizational documents  enter into certain hedging arrangements  amend material contracts  and enter into related party transactions 
with regard to hedging arrangements  our credit agreement provides that acceptable commodity hedging arrangements cannot cover greater than to  depending on the measurement date  of our monthly production from our hydrocarbon properties that are used in the borrowing base determination  and that the fixed or floor price of our hedging arrangements must be equal to or greater than the gas price used by the lenders in determining the borrowing base 
the credit agreement  as amended  also requires that we satisfy certain affirmative covenants  meet certain financial tests  maintain certain financial ratios and make certain customary indemnifications to lenders and the administrative agent 
the financial covenants include requirements to maintain i a ratio of ebitda to cash interest expense of not less than to  ii a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than to  iii a total debt to annualized ebitda ratio of not more than to  iv a quarterly total senior debt to annualized ebitda ratio equal to or less than to  and v a total proved pv value to total debt ratio of at least to 
the credit agreement  as amended  contains customary events of default  including payment defaults  covenant defaults  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  defaults in the payment of other material debt  judgment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  loss of material permits and licenses and a change in control 
the credit agreement requires any wholly owned subsidiaries to guarantee the obligations under the credit agreement 
on april   we and the administrative agent entered into the fourth amendment to the credit agreement which waived compliance with the current ratio financial covenant as of december  and march   and with the restrictive covenants related to accounts payable  permitted liens and permitted debt  subject to certain financial caps  until the next borrowing base redetermination expected in the fall of we believe that we may not be in compliance with certain restrictive covenants throughout  but will seek additional waivers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such waivers or that such waivers will be obtained on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to obtain future waivers and or to comply with the restrictive covenants and are therefore in default  the lenders could avail themselves of the remedies under the credit agreement  including acceleration and foreclosure 
due to borrowing base limitations and waiver stipulations  we are unable to incur additional debt under the credit agreement 
after an event of default  the outstanding debt bears interest at the default rate under the terms of the credit agreement 
the default rate is i with respect to principal  over the otherwise applicable rate and ii with respect to interest  fees and other amounts  the base rate as defined in the credit 
table of contents facility  plus the applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement  plus 
any default interest is payable on demand 
failure to pay the default interest when the administrative agent demands would be another default 
the lenders remedies for defaults under the credit agreement are to terminate further borrowings  accelerate the repayment of indebtedness and or ultimately foreclose on the collateral property 
effective august   we and the administrative agent and lender entered into the second amendment to the credit agreement the second amendment 
the second amendment provided  among other things  for i an increase in the total quarterly senior debt to annualized ebitda ratio from to  to to  ii an increase in interest at each utilization level for libor borrowings  iii the amendment of the utilization calculation to be determined as the greater of x the percentage of credit exposure over the borrowing base or y the percentage of credit exposure over three times ebitda minus permitted subordinated debt  and iv the payment of an amendment fee 
effective september   we and the administrative agent and lender entered into the third amendment to the credit agreement the third amendment 
in addition to waiving compliance with the current ratio covenant as of september   the third amendment  among other things  required that immediately prior to any additional borrowings under the credit agreement  our ratio of current assets to current liabilities be not less than to 
as a result of this new condition to additional borrowings  we are currently unable to borrow additional amounts under the credit agreement 
the third amendment also increased the interest rate payable under the credit agreement to either i the greater of the one month libor plus or a domestic bank rate  plus in either case an applicable margin of to based on utilization  or ii a sliding scale from the one  two  three or six month libor  plus an applicable margin of to based on utilization  and provided for the payment of an amendment fee 
we and the administrative agent entered into the fourth amendment to the credit agreement the fourth amendment dated as of april  in addition to waiving compliance with certain restrictive covenants  the fourth amendment reduced our borrowing base as described above 
office building loan 
on november   we entered into a mortgage loan secured by our office building in sheridan  wyoming in the aggregate principal amount of  the promissory note provides for monthly payments of principal and interest in the initial amount of  and unpaid principal bore interest at until november   and at a variable base rate plus thereafter and at upon a default 
the variable base rate is based on the lender s base rate 
the maturity date of this mortgage is november   at which time a principal and interest payment of  will become due 
as of december   we had  outstanding in principal on this mortgage 
on november   the interest rate on our mortgage loan changed from a fixed rate of to a variable rate 
as of december   the variable rate was 
capital expenditure budget 
we had a total capital expenditure budget of million for and expected to drill gross net wells during that period 
however  due to low cig index prices  the economic climate and limited capital resources  we reduced our capital expenditure budget resulting in actual capital expenditures of million 
in connection with our reduced capital expenditure budget  we also reduced our drilling and completion targets for to gross net wells 
we curtailed substantially all new drilling in the third and fourth quarters of  and have shut in a number of wells that are not economic at current natural gas price levels 
if natural gas prices remain low  we expect to continue to operate with a reduced capital expenditure plan through under our reduced capital expenditure plan  we would generally make such expenditures only as necessary to secure drilling permits in strategic areas  drill wells that secure leasehold positions and construct the necessary infrastructure to complete and hook up wells that have already been drilled 
the cig index price has been extremely volatile during and and at times reached unusually low levels 
for instance  the cig monthly index price per mcf was   and 
table of contents for delivery in september  october  november and december of  respectively 
if prices remain low  our cash flows from operations will decrease and the borrowing base and borrowing availability under our credit facility could be further reduced 
if we do not have sufficient cash flows and cannot obtain capital through our credit facility or otherwise  our ability to execute our development and acquisition plans  replace our reserves and maintain production levels could be greatly limited 
if natural gas prices do not improve  we will consider alternatives to increase liquidity  including asset sales and issuances of equity 
our capital expenditure budget for will be dependent upon cig index prices  our operating cash flows and the availability of additional capital resources 
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used by operating activities of million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to an increase in our accounts payable balance  a decrease in our accounts receivables and prepaid expenses along with an impairment of our oil and gas properties 
as a result of low natural gas prices  our cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to fund our cash requirements and we have been required to draw on our credit facility 
if natural gas prices continue to trend downward  our cash flows from operations will decrease and the borrowing base under our credit facility will be reduced 
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities increased in by million from due to increased investment in the acquisition and development of undeveloped leaseholds along with the related infrastructure 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately million in compared to due to decreased investment in the acquisition and development of undeveloped leaseholds primarily due to low gas prices in the rocky mountain region 
cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in from was primarily due to our april private placement and our may initial public offering 
the change in from was primarily due to our borrowings of million under our credit facility in and net proceeds of approximately million from our may initial public offering 
in april  we completed a private placement  exempt from registration under the securities act  of  shares of our common stock to qualified institutional buyers  non us persons and accredited investors at a price of per share  or per share net of the initial purchaser s discount and placement fee 
out of the approximately million of net proceeds after expenses we received in the private placement  we used i approximately million to redeem all of the outstanding shares of our series a redeemable preferred stock  including the payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends and a redemption premium  ii approximately million for our acquisition of the green river basin assets and iii approximately million to repurchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a price of per share from dlj merchant banking and gary w 
uhland  our former president  and iv approximately million to fund our development drilling program and pay additional offering expenses and for general corporate purposes 

table of contents in may  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  or per share net of underwriters discounts and commissions 
out of the approximately million of net proceeds after underwriters discounts and commissions and offering expenses we received in our initial public offering  we used million to pay down all of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
we used the remainder of the net proceeds for capital expenditures  infrastructure development and general corporate purposes 
there have been no issuances of shares of common stock since our initial public offering except to employees  executive officers and directors pursuant to our incentive stock plan 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or special purpose entities as of december  as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas prices or interest rates 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our natural gas production 
the prices we receive for our production depend on many factors beyond our control 
we seek to reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in natural gas prices  which are subject to significant and often volatile fluctuation  through the use of fixed price contracts 
our fixed price contracts are comprised of energy swaps and collars 
fixed price contracts allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for hedged production and benefit operating cash flows and earnings when market prices are less than the fixed prices provided by the contracts 
however  we will not benefit from market prices that are higher than the fixed prices in the contracts for hedged production 
collar structures provide for participation in price increases and decreases to the extent of the ceiling prices and floors provided in those contracts 
with regard to hedging arrangements  our credit facility provides that acceptable commodity hedging arrangements cannot cover greater than to  depending on the measurement date  of our monthly production from our hydrocarbon properties that are used in the borrowing base determination  and that the fixed or floor price of our hedging arrangements must be equal to or greater than the gas price used by the lenders in determining the borrowing base 
the following table summarizes the estimated volumes  fixed prices  fixed price sales and fair value attributable to the fixed price contracts as of december  at december   we had hedged volumes through december please see note and note of the notes to the audited

accordingly  our interest expenses are sensitive to market changes  which expose us to interest rate risk on current and future borrowings under our credit facility 
as of december  and march   we had million and million  respectively  in outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest either i at the greater of the one month libor plus or a domestic bank rate  plus in either case an applicable margin of to based on utilization  or ii on a sliding scale from one  two  three  or six month libor  plus an applicable margin of to based on utilization 
the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under our credit facility was for the year ended december  in light of the current economic climate  we expect that interest rates on alternative financing options to range from to 
the availability of alternative financing arrangements and the interest rates thereof would depend on the type of financing and our ability to restructure our current indebtness outstanding under our credit facility 
due to covenant restrictions in our credit facility  we are currently unable to borrow additional amounts 
a hypothetical increase of in either the domestic bank rate or the libor interest rates would increase gross interest expense approximately  per year based on our outstanding indebtness at december
