overview about us 
we are a leading online auction marketplace for surplus and salvage assets 
we enable buyers and sellers to transact in an efficient  automated online auction environment offering over product categories 
our marketplaces provide professional buyers access to a global  organized supply of surplus and salvage assets presented with digital images and other relevant product information 
additionally  we enable our corporate and government sellers to enhance their financial return on excess assets by providing a liquid marketplace and value added services that integrate sales and marketing  logistics and transaction settlement into a single offering 
we organize our products into categories across major industry verticals such as consumer electronics  general merchandise  apparel  scientific equipment  aerospace parts and equipment  technology hardware  and specialty equipment 
our online auction marketplaces are www 
liquidation 
com  www 
govliquidation 
com  www 
govdeals 
com and www 
liquibiz 
com 
we also operate a wholesale industry portal  www 
gowholesale 
com that connects advertisers with buyers seeking products for resale and related business services 
we believe our ability to create liquid marketplaces for surplus and salvage assets generates a continuous flow of goods from our corporate and government sellers 
this flow of goods in turn attracts an increasing number of professional buyers to our marketplaces 
during fiscal year  the number of registered buyers grew from approximately  to approximately  or 
during the past three fiscal years  we have conducted over  online transactions generating approximately million in gross merchandise volume 
approximately of our initial listings have resulted in a completed cash sale during the past three fiscal years 
our history 
we were incorporated in delaware in november as liquidation 
com  inc and commenced operations in early during  we developed our online auction marketplace platform and began auctioning merchandise primarily for small commercial sellers and government agencies 
in  we changed our name to liquidity services  inc in june  we were awarded our first major dod contract  the surplus contract 
under this agreement  we became the exclusive contractor with the drms  for the sale of usable dod surplus assets in the united states 
in june  we were awarded an additional exclusive contract with the drms to manage and sell substantially all dod scrap property 
during  we launched our wholesale industry portal  www 
gowholesale 
com 
recent initiatives 
on may   the dod agreed to extend the original surplus contract through november   as well as increase our share of net proceeds under the surplus contract to on property received after june  on november   the dod extended the original surplus contract through december   thus we will receive of the net proceeds on property received up until december  through the contract wind down period  which we anticipate will extend into fiscal year we responded to a rfp from the drms regarding a renewal of the surplus contract  and have been awarded the contract 
under the new surplus contract  under which we commenced operations on december   we are not required to distribute any portion of the profits realized under the contract  as the new contract structure requires a fixed price  of the drms acquisition value  to be paid for the property and allows us to retain all of the profits from the sale of property 
on february   the dod agreed to amend the 
table of contents new surplus contract  such that the fixed price  of the drms acquisition value  to be paid for the property  will be 
in addition 
the new surplus contract performance period will start from the time property was delivered during february the current economic downturn has impacted the gmv in our commercial business both in the us and the us as retailers have reduced the volume of goods sold due to continued weak consumer spending 
our uk business suffered during the second half of fiscal year  due to the loss of one of our major uk clients client was sold  which led to a material decrease in volume 
progress is underway to replace this volume but we continue to expect our uk business to negatively impact earnings in the near term 
we initiated cost savings initiatives in our uk business  including replacing some senior members of our operating team with managers having more operational and business development experience 
at the same time  we have made the necessary technology  finance  and back office investments to support our uk business for long term growth 
these changes  will position our uk business to better serve our existing clients  and allow us to aggressively add new significant clients 
we cannot predict  given the economic conditions  when we will realize these long term benefits 
our revenue 
we generate substantially all of our revenue by retaining a percentage of the proceeds from the sales we manage for our sellers 
we offer our sellers three primary transaction models a profit sharing model  a consignment model and a purchase model 
profit sharing model 
under our profit sharing model  we purchase inventory from our suppliers and share with them a portion of the profits received from a completed sale in the form of a distribution 
distributions are calculated based on the value received from the sale after deducting direct costs  such as sales and marketing  technology and operations and other general and administrative costs 
because we are the primary obligor  and take general and physical inventory risks and credit risk under this transaction model  we recognize as revenue the sale price paid by the buyer upon completion of a transaction 
revenue from our profit sharing model accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the merchandise sold under our profit sharing model accounted for approximately  and of our gross merchandise volume  or gmv  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
consignment model 
under our consignment model  we recognize commission revenue from sales of merchandise in our marketplaces that is owned by others 
these commissions  which we refer to as seller commissions  represent a percentage of the sale price the buyer pays upon completion of a transaction 
we vary the percentage amount of the seller commission depending on the various value added services we provide to the seller to facilitate the transaction 
for example  we generally increase the percentage amount of the commission if we take possession  handle  ship or provide enhanced product information for the merchandise 
we collect the seller commission by deducting the appropriate amount from the sales proceeds prior to their distribution to the seller after completion of the transaction 
revenue from our consignment model accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the merchandise sold under our consignment model accounted for approximately  and of our gmv for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
purchase model 
under our purchase model  we offer our sellers a fixed amount or the option to share a portion of the proceeds received from our completed sales in the form of a distribution 
distributions are calculated based on the value we receive from the sale after deducting a required return to us that we have negotiated with the seller 
because we are the primary obligor  and take general and physical inventory risks and credit risk under this transaction model  we recognize as revenue the sale price paid by the buyer upon completion of a 
table of contents transaction 
revenue from our purchase model accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the merchandise sold under our purchase model accounted for approximately  and of our gmv  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we collect a buyer premium on substantially all of our transactions under all of our transaction models 
buyer premiums are calculated as a percentage of the sale price of the merchandise sold and are paid to us by the buyer 
buyer premiums are in addition to the price of the merchandise 
under our profit sharing model  we typically share the proceeds of any buyer premiums with our sellers 
in fiscal years  and  we generated less than of our revenue from advertisements on our wholesale industry portals 
industry trends 
we believe there are several industry trends impacting the growth of our business including the increase in the adoption of the internet by businesses to conduct e commerce both in the united states and abroad  product innovation in the retail supply chain that has increased the pace of product obsolescence and  therefore  the supply of surplus assets  the increase in the volume of returned merchandise handled by both online and offline retailers  the increase in government regulations necessitating verifiable recycling and remarketing of surplus assets  the increase in outsourcing by corporate and government organizations of disposition activities for surplus and end of life assets  and as a result of the recent economic downturn  an increase in buyer demand for surplus merchandise as consumers trade down by purchasing less expensive goods and seek greater value from their purchases 
our seller agreements our dod agreements 
we have three contracts with the dod pursuant to which we acquire  manage and sell excess property surplus contract 
in june  we were awarded the surplus contract  a competitive bid exclusive contract under which we acquire  manage and sell all usable dod surplus personal property turned into the drms 
surplus property generally consists of items determined by the dod to be no longer needed  and not claimed for reuse by  any federal agency  such as computers  electronics  office supplies  scientific and medical equipment  aircraft parts  clothing and textiles 
revenue from our surplus contract including buyer premiums accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the property sold under our surplus contract accounted for approximately  and of our gmv for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
on november   the dod extended the original surplus contract through december   thus we will receive of the net proceeds on property received up until december  through the contract wind down period  which we anticipate will extend into fiscal year we responded to a rfp from the drms regarding a renewal of the surplus contract  and have been awarded the contract 
we began operations under the new contract on december  the new surplus contract expires in february  subject to dod s right to extend it for two additional one year terms scrap contract 
in june  we were awarded a competitive bid exclusive contract under which we acquire  manage and sell substantially all scrap property of the dod turned into the drms 
scrap property generally consists of items determined by dod to have no use beyond their base material content  such as metals  alloys  and building materials 
revenue from our scrap contract including buyer premiums accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the property sold under our scrap contract accounted for approximately  and 
table of contents of our gmv for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we were required to pay million to the dod in fiscal for the right to manage the operations and remarket scrap material in connection with the scrap contract 
the scrap contract expires in june  subject to dod s right to extend it for three additional one year terms 
under the original surplus contract  we were obligated to purchase all dod surplus property at set prices representing a percentage of the original acquisition cost  which varied depending on the type of surplus property being purchased 
under the scrap contract  we acquire scrap property at a per pound price 
we were initially entitled to approximately of the profits of sale defined as gross proceeds of sale less allowable operating expenses under the contracts  and the dod was entitled to approximately of the profits 
we refer to these disbursement payments to dod as profit sharing distributions 
as a result of these arrangements  we recognize as revenue the gross proceeds from these sales 
dod also reimburses us for actual costs incurred for packing  loading and shipping property under the scrap and original surplus contracts that we are obligated to pick up from non dod locations 
on september   we entered into a bilateral contract modification under which the dod agreed to increase our profit sharing percentage under the original surplus contract in exchange for our agreement to implement additional inventory assurance processes and procedures with respect to the sale of demilitarized property 
under the terms of the contract modification  from august  until november   we were entitled to receive of the profits under the surplus contract and the dod was entitled to receive 
for property received from november  through june   we were entitled to receive between and of the profits and thus the dod received between and of the profits  based on the results of an audit of the effectiveness of the inventory controls we implemented under the contract modification  which is referred to as the surplus contract incentive 
this incentive was measured quarterly 
on june   we agreed  as provided in the modification to the original surplus contract that became effective as of september   to provide additional value added services with respect to demilitarized property that is returned to the dod for reutilization 
in exchange for our agreement to provide these services  the dod exercised its existing option to increase our share of net proceeds under the original surplus contract by 
on may   the dod agreed to extend the original surplus contract through november   as well as increase our share of net proceeds under the original surplus contract to on property received after june  on november   the dod extended the original surplus contract through december  under the new surplus contract  which began on december   we are not required to distribute any portion of the profits realized under the contract  as the new contract contains a higher fixed percentage price of  of the drms acquisition value  to be paid for the property 
under the scrap contract  we also have a small business performance incentive based on the number of scrap buyers that are small businesses that would allow us to receive up to an additional of the profit sharing distribution 
on may   we entered into a bilateral contract modification under which the dod agreed to increase the profit sharing distribution for the scrap contract from to effective june   in exchange for our agreement to implement additional inventory assurance processes and procedures with respect to the mutilation of demilitarized scrap property sold 
our uk mod agreement 
in july  we were awarded a contract to manage and sell surplus property from the united kingdom ministry of defence 
this contract generated less than of our revenue in fiscal years  and this contract expires in july our commercial agreements 
during fiscal year  we had over corporate clients who each sold in excess of  of surplus and salvage assets in our marketplaces 
our agreements with these clients are generally terminable at will by either party 

table of contents key business metrics our management periodically reviews certain key business metrics for operational planning purposes and to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocation of resources and our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our business 
these key business metrics include gross merchandise volume 
gross merchandise volume  or gmv  is the total sales value of all merchandise sold through our marketplaces during a given period 
we review gmv because it provides a measure of the volume of goods being sold in our marketplaces and thus the activity of those marketplaces 
gmv also provides a means to evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have made and continue to make  including in the areas of customer support  value added services  product development  sales and marketing  and operations 
the gmv of goods sold in our marketplace during fiscal year totaled million 
completed transactions 
completed transactions represents the number of auctions in a given period from which we have recorded revenue 
similar to gmv  we believe that completed transactions is a key business metric because it provides an additional measurement of the volume of activity flowing through our marketplaces 
during the fiscal year ended september   we completed approximately  transactions 
total registered buyers 
we grow our buyer base through a combination of marketing and promotional efforts 
a person becomes a registered buyer by completing an online registration process on one of our marketplaces 
as part of this process  we collect business and personal information  including name  title  company name  business address and contact information  and information on how the person intends to use our marketplaces 
each prospective buyer must also accept our terms and conditions of use 
following the completion of the online registration process  we verify each prospective buyer s e mail address and confirm that the person is not listed on any banned persons list maintained internally or by the us federal government 
after the verification process  which is completed generally within hours  the registration is approved and activated and the prospective buyer is added to our registered buyer list 
total registered buyers  as of a given date  represents the aggregate number of persons or entities who have registered on one of our marketplaces 
we use this metric to evaluate how well our marketing and promotional efforts are performing 
total registered buyers excludes duplicate registrations  buyers who are suspended from utilizing our marketplaces and those buyers who have voluntarily removed themselves from our registration database 
in addition  if we become aware of registered buyers that are no longer in business  we remove them from our database 
as of september   we had approximately  registered buyers 
total auction participants 
for each auction we manage  the number of auction participants represents the total number of registered buyers who have bid one or more times in that auction 
as a result  a registered buyer who bids  or participates  in more than one auction is counted as an auction participant in each auction in which he or she participates 
thus  total auction participants for a given period is the sum of the auction participants in each auction conducted during that period 
we use this metric to allow us to compare our online auction marketplaces to our competitors  including other online auction sites and traditional on site auctioneers 
in addition  we measure total auction participants on a periodic basis to evaluate the activity level of our base of registered buyers and to measure the performance of our marketing and promotional efforts 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately  total auction participants participated in auctions on our marketplaces 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting estimate is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
for transactions in our online marketplaces  which generate substantially all of our revenue  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met a buyer submits the winning bid in an auction and  as a result  evidence of an arrangement exists and the sale price has been determined  title has passed to a buyer and the buyer has assumed risks and rewards of ownership  for arrangements with an inspection period  the buyer has received the merchandise and has not notified us within that period that it is dissatisfied with the merchandise  and collection is reasonably assured 
substantially all of our sales are recorded subsequent to payment authorization being received  utilizing credit cards  wire transfers and paypal  an internet based payment system  as methods of payments 
as a result  we are not subject to significant collection risk  as goods are generally not shipped before payment is received 
revenue is also evaluated for reporting revenue of gross proceeds as the principal in the arrangement or net of commissions as an agent 
in arrangements in which we are deemed to be the primary obligor  bear physical and general inventory risk  and credit risk  we recognize as revenue the gross proceeds from the sale  including buyer s premiums 
arrangements in which we act as an agent or broker on a consignment basis  without taking general or physical inventory risk  revenue is recognized based on the sales commissions that are paid to us by the sellers for utilizing our services  in this situation  sales commissions represent a percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale that the seller pays to us upon completion of the transaction 
we have evaluated our revenue recognition policy related to sales under our profit sharing model and determined it is appropriate to account for these sales on a gross 
the following factors were most heavily relied upon in our determination we are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
we are the seller in substance and in appearance to the buyer  the buyer contacts us if there is a problem with the purchase 
only we and the buyer are parties to the sales contract and the buyer has no recourse to the supplier 
if the buyer has a problem  he or she looks to us  not the supplier 
the buyer does not and cannot look to the supplier for fulfillment or for product acceptability concerns 

table of contents we have general inventory risk 
we take title to the inventory upon paying the amount set forth in the contract with the supplier 
such amount is generally a percentage of the supplier s original acquisition cost and varies depending on the type of the inventory purchased 
we are at risk of loss for all amounts paid to the supplier in the event the property is damaged or otherwise becomes unsaleable 
in addition  as payments made for inventory are excluded from the calculation for the profit sharing distribution under our dod contracts  we effectively bear inventory risk for the full amount paid to acquire the property ie  there is no sharing of inventory risk 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we identify and value intangible assets that we acquire in business combinations  such as customer arrangements  customer relationships and non compete agreements  that arise from contractual or other legal rights or that are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
the fair value of identified intangible assets is based upon an estimate of the future economic benefits expected to result from ownership  which represents the amount at which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
we test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
examples of such events or circumstances could include a significant change in business climate or a loss of significant customers 
we apply a two step fair value based test to assess goodwill for impairment 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is then performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to the fair value of the goodwill 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recorded in our statements of operations 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be realizable 
our management makes certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment  and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value  corroborated by comparisons to estimated market multiples 
these valuations are based on a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets  which totaled million at september  such events may include strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our base of buyers and sellers or material negative changes in our relationships with material customers 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities existing at each balance sheet date using enacted tax rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid or recovered 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets to a level that we believe will more likely than not be realized 
the resulting net deferred tax asset reflects management s estimate of the amount that will be realized 

table of contents we adopted the provisions of authoritative guidance issued by the fasb related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on october  the adoption of this new authoritative guidance did not impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company has concluded that there were no uncertain tax positions identified during its analysis 
we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
stock based compensation 
we recognize in the statements of operations all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair values of share based payments 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with little need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited financial statements and related notes  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
components of revenue and expenses revenue 
we generate substantially all of our revenue from sales of merchandise held in inventory and by retaining a percentage of the proceeds from the sales 
our revenue recognition practices are discussed in more detail in the section above entitled critical accounting estimates 
cost of goods sold excluding amortization 
cost of goods sold includes the costs of purchasing and transporting property for auction  as well as credit card transaction fees 
profit sharing distributions 
our scrap and original surplus contracts with the dod have been structured as profit sharing arrangements in which we purchase and take possession of all goods we receive from the dod at a contractual percentage of the original acquisition cost of those goods 
after deducting allowable operating expenses  we disburse to the dod on a monthly basis a percentage of the profits of the aggregate monthly sales 
we retain the remaining percentage of these profits after the dod s disbursement 
we refer to these disbursement payments to dod as profit sharing distributions 
technology and operations 
technology expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to our programming staff who develop and deploy new marketplaces and continuously enhance existing marketplaces 
these personnel also develop and upgrade the software systems that support our operations  such as sales processing 
because our marketplaces and support systems require frequent upgrades and enhancements to maintain viability  we have determined that the useful life for substantially all of our internally developed software is less than one year 
as a result  we expense these costs as incurred 
operations expenses consist primarily of operating costs  including buyer relations  shipping logistics and distribution center operating costs 

table of contents sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include the cost of our sales and marketing personnel as well as the cost of marketing and promotional activities 
these activities include online marketing campaigns such as paid search advertising 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support our operations and provide an infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of these expenses include executive management and staff salaries  bonuses and related taxes and employee benefits  travel  headquarters rent and related occupancy costs  and legal and accounting fees 
the salaries  bonus and employee benefits costs included as general and administrative expenses are generally more fixed in nature than our operating expenses and do not vary directly with the volume of merchandise sold through our marketplaces 
amortization of contract intangibles 
amortization of contract intangibles expense consists of the amortization of our scrap contract award during june this contract required us to purchase the rights to operate the scrap operations of the dod during the seven year base term of the contract 
the intangible asset created from the million purchase is being amortized over months on a straight line basis 
the amortization period is correlated to the base term of the contract  exclusive of renewal periods 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of the depreciation and amortization of amounts recorded in connection with the purchase of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
interest income and other income  net 
interest income and other income  net consists primarily of interest income on cash and short term investments and interest expense on borrowings under our notes payable and realized gains or losses on short term investments 
income taxes 
during fiscal years  and  we had an effective income tax rate of approximately  and  respectively  which included federal  state and foreign income taxes 
our effective income tax rate increased principally because we recorded a  valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of our foreign subsidiaries  consisting principally of net operating loss carryforwards 
 of the valuation allowance was necessitated by losses in recent years at our uk subsidiary  especially in  primarily as a result of the loss of our largest client 
we estimate that our future effective income tax rate will be approximately  which is comprised of approximately for federal taxes  approximately for state taxes  and approximately for book and tax differences including stock based compensation expenses  primarily related to employee stock options  which are currently expensed in our financial statements but are not deductable for tax purposes until they are exercised

the intangible asset created from the million purchase is being amortized over months on a straight line basis  which began in august depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september   primarily due to additional depreciation expense resulting from the purchase of million of property and equipment during fiscal year ended september  compared to the purchase of million of property and equipment during fiscal year ended september  interest income and other income  net

table of contents net income 
net income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
we did not have any debt as of september  and thus do not have any related interest rate exposure 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income consistent with minimizing risk of material loss 
as of september   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and our short term investments consisted primarily of highly rated short term bonds 
the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are short term in nature 
due to the nature of our short term investments  which have a duration of three to twelve months  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
exchange rate sensitivity 
we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal  as less than six percent of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
we have not engaged in any hedging or other derivative transactions to date
