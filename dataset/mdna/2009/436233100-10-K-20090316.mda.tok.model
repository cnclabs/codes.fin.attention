note regarding known material trends  uncertainties and opportunities impacting hollywood media hollywood media expects to have continuing losses in the near term 
notwithstanding these losses  as described below under liquidity and capital resources  hollywood media expects that it will be able to satisfy its near term liquidity obligations 
other than the normal seasonal variance described under inflation and seasonality  hollywood media does not expect that there will be a significant variance in its earnings or its cash flows near term and accordingly does not expect its trend of losses to accelerate 
known material trends  uncertainties and other factors that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on hollywood media s revenues  earnings and liquidity include the following the united states and global economic downturn  which can adversely affect business and personal discretionary spending for entertainment related items such as theater tickets  and has resulted in a reduction in tickets sold and in net revenue  increases in broadway ticket prices  which can positively affect hollywood media s revenues as the ticket service fees hollywood media earns are based on a percentage of ticket prices  but which can also result in a lower of volume of tickets being sold and could adversely affect hollywood media s revenues and  accordingly  its earnings and cash flow  and new york state s repeal of caps on ticket service fees  which has given hollywood media greater flexibility to charge increased service fees on tickets for high demand shows  such as wicked and jersey boys 
hollywood media is also exploring market opportunities which could have a material impact on its revenues  earnings and liquidity  including expansion into discount ticketing markets 
such expansion would allow hollywood media to sell tickets at variable price points  which hollywood media expects would attract a greater variety of customers 
there is no assurance  however  that hollywood media will ultimately pursue these opportunities or if it does  that they will be successful

critical accounting estimates in response to the sec s release number cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and sec release number  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of 
table of contents our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for compensation and related benefits  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for additional information about our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts hollywood media maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company s accounting for doubtful accounts contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectibility of these accounts 
when preparing these estimates  management considers a number of factors  including the aging of a customer s account  past transactions with customers  creditworthiness of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and the allowance is primarily attributable to receivables due from customers of cinemasonline 
although the company believes its allowance is sufficient  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to unexpectedly deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base and their dispersion across many different geographic regions

 goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  are no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to june  ceased to be amortized beginning january  in addition  sfas changed the way we evaluated goodwill and intangibles for impairment 
beginning january   goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized  however  they are subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test 
the fair value based test is a two step test 
the first step involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to proceed to the second step 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets including unrecognized intangibles and liabilities of the reporting unit  with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value 
as prescribed by sfas no 
 we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by the second quarter of fiscal which did not result in an impairment charge 
additionally  hollywood media established october  as its annual impairment test date and conducted required testing on that date during fiscal  and as part of our fiscal annual impairment evaluation  the company determined that the goodwill associated with its cinemasonline business should be written off  and  accordingly  the company recorded an impairment loss of million 
in addition  the company recorded million in additional impairment to goodwill recorded after our acquisition of always independent entertainment corp 
and our intellectual properties segment 
in december and  there were no adjustments to long lived assets 
as of december   we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of hollywood media s goodwill for impairment further 
the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
at december  and goodwill represented and  respectively  of total assets 
future changes in estimates used to conduct the 
table of contents impairment review  including revenue projections or market values could cause the analysis to indicate that hollywood media s goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of the goodwill 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of our reporting units on the impairment calculation  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
as of december   the company s market capitalization is less than the book value of its equity 
the company believes that the disparity between the book value of its assets as compared to the market capitalization of its business is in large part a consequence of current market conditions  including perceived risks in the debt markets  the company s industry and the broader economy 
while the company believes that some of these risks are unique to specific companies  some represent global industry risks 
the company believes that there is no fundamental change in our underlying business model or prospects for our company 
we consider the decline in our market capitalization to be temporary and based on general economic conditions and a decline in general investor confidence throughout the market and not based on any events or conditions specific to us 
the company has evaluated the impairment of its goodwill  giving consideration to these risks  and their impact upon the respective reporting units fair values  and has reported impairments where it deems appropriate 
the company believes that the fair value of its remaining reporting units that contain goodwill at december  exceeds the book value of those units 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation  we do not believe inflation has a material effect on revenue or results of operations 
we consider our business to be somewhat seasonal and expect net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for our tekno books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi annually 
the broadway ticketing business is also influenced by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the tony awards and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holiday period 
in addition  although not seasonal  our intellectual properties division and netco partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams  earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements 
the recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in our assets or liabilities that might occur due to changes in market rates and prices  such as interest or foreign currency exchange rates  as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
interest rates charged on hollywood media s debt instruments are primarily fixed in nature 
we therefore do not believe that the risk of loss relating to the effect of changes in market interest rates is material 
we have investments in subsidiaries in the united kingdom and sell our services into this foreign market 
our foreign net asset exposures defined as assets denominated in foreign currency less liabilities denominated in foreign currency for the united kingdom at december  of us dollar equivalents was a net liability of million 
our united kingdom subsidiaries sell services and pay for products and services in british pounds 
a decrease in the british foreign currency relative to the us dollar could adversely impact our margins 
an assumed depreciation of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar over the course of fiscal us  in addition to actual exchange experience would have resulted in a translation reduction of our revenue by million for fiscal 
table of contents as the assets  liabilities and transactions of our united kingdom subsidiaries are denominated in british pounds  the results and financial condition are subject to translation adjustments upon their conversion into us dollars for our financial reporting purposes 
a decline in this foreign currency relative to the us dollar over the course of ie  in addition to actual exchange experience would have resulted in a translation increase in our net loss of million for fiscal
