our investment strategy continues to provide benefits to our overall business performance 
we are focused on both the quality of our investment portfolio and on investing new money in investments appropriate for our liabilities and with yields that will increase our portfolio yield 
our net investment income in was slightly below the level of due primarily to a decrease in the level of bond call premiums 
included in results are net realized investment losses from sales and write downs of investments related primarily to fixed maturity securities in the financial institutions  automotive  and media sectors that we either sold or considered other than temporarily impaired during the third and fourth quarters of we believe our investment portfolio is well positioned for the current environment  with historically low levels of below investment grade securities  no exposure to subprime mortgages  alt a loans  or collateralized debt obligations in our asset backed or mortgage backed securities portfolios  and minimal exposure to collateralized debt obligations within our public bond portfolio 
further discussion is included in investments contained in this item strategic and capital initiatives the first priority of our capital management strategy is to maintain sufficient financial flexibility to support our operations over various economic cycles and to respond to opportunities in the marketplace while positioning our company for improvements in its credit ratings 
we have several financial targets which guide our capital management decisions including maintain a risk based capital ratio of percent or greater for our traditional us insurance subsidiaries 
this is to be measured on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula 
maintain leverage at approximately percent 
leverage will be measured as total debt to total capital  which we define as total long term and short term debt plus stockholders equity  excluding the net unrealized gain or loss on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges 
this target level excludes the non recourse debt and associated capital of tailwind holdings and northwind holdings 
maintain cash and liquid investments at our holding companies sufficient to cover one year of fixed charges measured as interest expense plus common stock dividends plus a capital fund which will vary with business and economic conditions 
maintain a common stock dividend yield that is near the median of our peer companies 
at the end of  all of our financial measurements for capital management continue to compare favorably to our target levels 
we have completed our million authorized share repurchase program  and we have maintained our leverage at percent  compared to percent at the end of see liquidity and capital resources contained in this item for further detail 
economic environment analysis and stress testing are important aspects of understanding our financial risk exposure and developing proactive risk management efforts 
as part of our recessionary analysis  we have identified the following potential challenges to our business outlook  as well as what we perceive to be opportunities and mitigating factors  resulting from the current economy 

table of contents 
index to financial statements potential challenges lower premium income from fewer employees in the work force of our markets  employer and employee paid cost pressures may also limit sales and reduce persistency 
lower net investment income from fewer long term assets to match our liability portfolio  lower bond call prepayment income 
lower investment income and or higher realized investment losses due to an increase in defaults 
higher unrealized investment losses 
higher disability claim costs 
higher operating expense ratios due to declining premiums 
opportunities and mitigating factors lower premium income may be mitigated by mix of business and by our growing position in the voluntary market 
lower premium income may be mitigated by the flexibility of our product design and pricing 
we may achieve higher investment income from wider corporate spreads which enhance investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturity securities 
we have low levels of exposure to high risk investments 
we believe our claim reserve discount rates are adequate relative to investment portfolio yield rates 
we believe our risk management is strong  we have a diversified business mix  with a core market focus which generally has lower and less volatile claim incidence 
our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is consistent  even during cycles of economic downturns 
we manage our expenses aggressively and have cost management initiatives in place 
we believe our risk based capital and holding company liquidity position us well for an economic downturn 
our business outlook recognizes both the challenges of the current economic environment as well as the mitigating impact of risk reducing actions we have taken in recent years  including product diversification across sectors and locations  our mix of business  our disciplined underwriting  pricing  claims  and expense management  a reduced credit risk profile in our investment portfolio  our capital management strategy  and better risk management practices 
our outlook is responsive to our risk management framework and is consistent with our risk appetite 
although occurrence of one or more of the risk factors previously discussed herein in item a may cause our results to differ from our outlook  we believe that our business outlook is built on sound operating plans that have been tested against many of the challenges presented by the current economic environment 
focus for during  we intend to continue our focus on a number of key areas 
consistent execution of our operating plans 
we will continue our emphasis on disciplined  profitable growth 
maintain a strong investment portfolio 
we will maintain disciplined credit analysis in our selection of investment assets and continue to be conservative within our investment risk tolerances 
build and effectively use capital 
we intend to continue to build capital and manage it effectively within our stated capital management strategy objectives

the revised second quarter of estimate was based on the cost of approximately percent of the potential inventory of claim reassessment information forms returned to us  with our claim reassessment on approximately percent of the forms completed at that time 
at the time of our second quarter of revision  we had not yet finalized our claim reassessment on the remaining forms but had performed a financial review and included that information in our analysis of emerging experience

significant transactions and events legal and regulatory issues revised claim reassessment reserve estimate in the first quarter of  we completed an analysis of our assumptions related to the reserves we established for our claim reassessment process 
our analysis was based on preliminary data as of the end of the first quarter of  when actual results to date were considered credible enough to enable us to update our initial expectations of costs related to the reassessment process 
we concluded that a change in our initial assumptions  primarily related to the number of claimants for whom payments will continue because the claimant remains eligible for disability payments  was warranted 
we based our conclusion and our revised estimate on the information that existed at that time  which was the actual cost related to approximately percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed 
the characteristics  profile  and cost of those initial percent of claims were more statistically credible than the information on which we based the initial charges in and based on our analysis  in the first quarter of we recorded a charge of million before tax  or million after tax  to reflect our then current estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment 
the first quarter charge decreased before tax operating results for our unum us group disability line of business million and our individual disability closed block segment million 
in the third quarter of  we increased our provision for the cost of the reassessment process million before tax and million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned by the reassessment process and the average cost per reassessed claim 
the revised third quarter estimate was based on the cost of approximately percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed 
the third quarter charge was comprised of million to reflect our revised estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment and million for additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses because of the additional time then estimated to complete the process 
our best estimate of million for the reopened claims assumed that the nature and characteristics of the approximately percent remaining claims estimated to be reassessed at that time would be similar to the

additionally  we responded to investigations about certain of these same matters by state attorneys general and the us department of labor dol 
following highly publicized litigation involving the alleged practices of a major insurance broker  the naic has undertaken to provide a uniform compensation disclosure amendment to the producer licensing model act that can be adopted by states in an effort to provide uniform guidance to insurers  brokers  and customers relating to disclosure of broker compensation 
we expect there to be continued uncertainty surrounding this matter until clearer regulatory guidelines are established 
in june  we received a subpoena from the nyag requesting documents and information relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers or intermediaries and us and our subsidiaries 
in november  we entered into a settlement agreement on broker compensation with the nyag in the form of an assurance of discontinuance that provided for a national restitution fund of million and a fine of million 
we support the full disclosure of compensation paid to both brokers and agents and have implemented policies to facilitate customers obtaining information regarding broker compensation from their brokers 
additionally  we provide appropriate notices to customers stating our policy surrounding disclosure and provide information on our company website about our broker compensation programs 
under these policies  any customer who wants specific broker compensation related information can obtain this information by contacting our broker compensation services at a toll free number

also  under sfas  defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations are to be measured as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end 
the adoption of sfas  which resulted in an million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  had no effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the accounting estimates we deem to be most critical to our results of operations and balance sheets are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits  deferred acquisition costs  investments  and income taxes 
estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known  which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
for additional information  refer to our significant accounting policies in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item reserves for policy and contract benefits our largest liabilities are reserves for claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders 
the two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
these reserves equaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively  or approximately percent of our total liabilities 
reserves ceded to reinsurers were billion and billion at december  and  respectively  and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets 
policy reserves policy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums  allowing a margin for expenses and profit 
these reserves relate primarily to our traditional non interest sensitive products  including our individual disability  individual and group long term care  and voluntary benefits products in our unum us segment  individual disability products in our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements unum uk segment  disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our colonial life segment  and  the individual disability closed block segment products 
the reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate ie  loss recognition occurs 
persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations 
claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations 
discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns 
in establishing policy reserves  we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience  which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation 
we do not  however  establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions 
we perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually  or more frequently if appropriate  using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test  without a provision for adverse deviation 
we group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests 
if the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance  the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency 
thereafter  the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing  referred to as the gross premium valuation method  wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation loss recognition date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive 
we maintain policy reserves for a policy for as long as the policy remains in force  even after a separate claim reserve is established 
policy reserves for unum us  unum uk  and colonial life products  which at december  represented approximately percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our total gross policy reserves  are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by gaap 
in applying this method  we use  as applicable by product type  morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions  claim resolution rate assumptions  and policy persistency assumptions  among others  to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income 
we then apply an interest  or discount  rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive  with a provision for profit allowed 
policy reserves for our individual disability closed block segment  which at december   represented approximately percent of our total gross policy reserves  are determined using the gross premium valuation method based on assumptions established as of january   the date of loss recognition 
key assumptions are policy persistency  claim incidence  claim resolution rates  commission rates  and maintenance expense rates 
we then apply an interest  or discount  rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive 
there is no provision for profit 
the interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for this segment 
under the gross premium valuation method  we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions 
gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient 
we perform loss recognition tests on the policy reserves for this block of business quarterly 
the corporate and other segment includes certain products no longer actively marketed  the majority of which have been reinsured 
policy reserves for this segment represent billion on a gross basis  or approximately percent  of our total policy reserves 
we have ceded billion of the related policy reserves to reinsurers 
the ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable 
we continue to service a block of group pension products  which we have not ceded  and the policy reserves for these products are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates 
expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilities 
claim reserves claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr to us and  as prescribed by gaap  equals our long term best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses 
a claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim  such as the benefits available under the applicable policy  the covered benefit period  and the age and occupation of the claimant  as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration and discount rate 
reserves for ibnr claims  similar to incurred claim reserves  include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims  are also based on historical incidence rate assumptions  including claim reporting patterns  the average cost of claims  and the expected volumes of incurred claims 
our incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptions 
claim reserves  unlike policy reserves  are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change 
each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate 
if we believe  based on our actual experience and our view of future events  that our long term assumptions need to be modified  we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period income 
multiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities  with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages 
available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method  the paid development method  the incurred loss development method  the count and severity method  and the expected claim cost method 
no singular method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines 
the estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserves at that time 
claim reserves supporting our unum us group and individual disability and group and individual long term care lines of business and our individual disability closed block segment represent approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our total claim reserves at december  we use a tabular reserve methodology for group and individual long term disability and group and individual long term care claims that have been reported 
under the tabular reserve methodology  reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants  such as age  length of time disabled  and medical diagnosis 
we believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim 
ibnr claim reserves for our long term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs 
for group short term disability products  an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted  as well as ibnr claims  is determined in aggregate rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for our long term products  using historical patterns of claim incidence as well as historical patterns of aggregate claim resolution rates 
the average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our long term liabilities and results in less estimation variability 
claim reserves supporting the unum us group life and accidental death and dismemberment products represent approximately percent of our total claim reserves at december  claim reserves for these products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid  ibnr death claims  and a liability for waiver of premium benefits 
the death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid  the ibnr reserve is calculated using the count and severity method  and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology 

table of contents 
index to financial statements claim reserves supporting our unum uk segment represent approximately percent of our total claim reserves at december   and are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for unum us disability and group life reserves 
the assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this line of business are based on standard united kingdom industry experience  adjusted for unum uk s own experience 
the majority of the colonial life segment lines of business have short term benefits  which have less estimation variability than our long term products because of the shorter claim payout period 
our claim reserves for colonial life s lines of business  which approximate percent of our total claim reserves at december   are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience 
the incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date 
where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate  we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure 
the key assumptions for claim reserves for the colonial life lines of business are the timing  rate  and amount of estimated future claim payments  and the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims 
the following table displays policy reserves  incurred claim reserves  and ibnr claim reserves by major product line  with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable 
incurred claim reserves represent reserves determined for each incurred claim and also include estimated amounts for litigation expenses and other expenses associated with the payment of the claims as well as provisions for claims which we estimate will be reopened for our long term care products 
ibnr claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products 
the ibnr and reopen claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring that has only been on a combined basis

key assumptions the calculation of policy and claim reserves involves numerous assumptions  but the primary assumptions used to calculate reserves are the discount rate  the claim resolution rate  and the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves 
of these assumptions  our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions 
table of contents 
index to financial statements have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time 
the discount rate  which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves  is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value 
a higher discount rate produces a lower reserve 
if the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns  our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments 
in this case  the reserves may eventually be insufficient 
we set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves  considering current and expected future market conditions 
if the investment yield on new investments that are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio  it is likely that the discount rate assumption on claims will be established to reflect the effect of the new investment yield 
the claim resolution rate  used for both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves  is the probability that a disability claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured 
it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim 
estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time 
claim resolution assumptions involve many factors  including the cause of disability  the policyholder s age  the type of contractual benefits provided  and the time since initially becoming disabled 
we use our own claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions 
these assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability 
our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years  with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years 
we also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience 
the incidence rate  used for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves  is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us 
the incidence rate is affected by many factors including the age of the insured  the insured s occupation or industry  the benefit plan design  and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment 
we establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations 
establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors 
reserves  particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long term disabilities  are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion 
the impact of internal and external events  such as changes in claims management procedures  economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence  the emergence of new diseases  new trends and developments in medical treatments  and legal trends and legislative changes  among other factors  will influence claim incidence and resolution rates 
reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line 
additionally  in any period and over time  our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long term assumptions  either singularly or collectively  and these variances may offset each other 
we test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a long term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time 
therefore it is not possible to bifurcate the assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of a change in each assumption  but rather in the aggregate by product line 
we have presented in the following section an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions  in aggregate  for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for  either favorable or unfavorable 
trends in key assumptions because our actual experience regarding persistency and claim incidence has varied very little from our policy reserve and ibnr claim reserve assumptions  we have had minimal adjustments to our persistency assumptions and claim incidence assumptions during the years through generally  we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent 
table of contents 
index to financial statements that these trends do change  we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time 
however  we have historically experienced an increase in our group long term disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period  particularly in our unum us operations 
given the current weakening economy  it is possible that our claim incidence rates for this type of product may increase 
actual new money interest rates varied throughout but generally trended downward for all segments and product lines during and the assumptions we use to discount our reserves generally trended downward slightly for all segments and product lines during   and reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims have been adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns 
changes in our discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the long duration investment portfolio needed to support the reserves for the majority of our lines of business 
both the mortality rate experience and the retirement rate experience for our block of group pension products have remained stable and consistent with expectations 
claim resolution rates have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions 
these rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately 
claim resolution rates in our unum us segment group and individual long term disability product lines and our individual disability closed block segment have over the last several years exhibited some variability 
relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business  actual quarterly rates during the period through have varied by and percent in our unum us group long term disability line of business  between and percent in our unum us individual disability recently issued line of business  and between and percent in our individual disability closed block segment 
claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time 
during  we experienced quarter to quarter variability in our claim resolution rates 
we believe this variability was primarily the result of a short term reduction in the operating effectiveness of our unum us and individual disability closed block segment claims management performance 
during and continuing throughout  we gained more stability in our claims management performance  and our claim resolution rates were more consistent with our long term assumptions 
our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period  both favorably and unfavorably 
we monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate 
in our estimation  scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions  when modeled together in aggregate  could produce a potential result  either positive or negative  in our unum us group disability line of business that would change our reserve balance by percent 
using our actual claim reserve balance at december   this variation would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of million to our claim reserves 
using the same sensitivity analysis approach for our individual disability closed block segment  the claim reserve balance could potentially vary by percent of our reported balance  which at december   would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of million to our claim reserves 
the major contributor to the variance for both the group long term disability line of business and the individual disability closed block segment is the claim resolution rate 
we believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions  in the aggregate  could result in a material impact on our reserve levels  but we record our reserves based on our long term best estimate 
because these product lines have long term claim payout periods  there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs  either positive or negative 
deferred acquisition costs dac we defer certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortize expense these costs over the life of the related policies 
deferred costs include certain commissions  other agency compensation  selection and policy issue expenses  and field expenses 
acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business  such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy  are excluded from deferral 

table of contents 
index to financial statements over percent of our dac relates to traditional non interest sensitive products  and we amortize dac in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of dac are future persistency and future premium income 
we use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining the expected persistency and premium income 
the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to higher anticipated policy persistency in the early years  which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy 
during  our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization did not change materially from those we had previously used 
we adopted the provisions of sop effective january  the adoption of sop shortened the amortization period of our unum us and unum uk group disability  group life  and group accidental death and dismemberment products  as shown below 
the amortization periods for the other product lines were not impacted by the adoption of sop generally  we do not expect our persistency or interest rates to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent that these trends do change  we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time 
presented below are our assumptions  both before and after the adoption of sop  for the years   and  regarding the length of our amortization periods and the approximate dac balance that remains at the end of years   and  as a percentage of the cost initially deferred 
and balance remaining as a balance remaining as a amortization of initial deferral amortization of initial deferral period year year year period year year unum us group disability group life and accidental death dismemberment to supplemental and voluntary individual disability recently issued long term care to voluntary benefits to unum uk group disability group life individual disability colonial life to amortization of dac on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the anticipated experience  and as a result  the unamortized balance of dac reflects actual persistency 
we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected 
because our actual experience regarding persistency and premium income has varied very little from our assumptions during the last three years  we have had minimal adjustments to our projected amortization of dac during those years 
we measure the recoverability of dac annually by performing gross premium valuations 
our testing indicates that our dac is recoverable 
valuation of investments all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
our derivative financial instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
we hold an immaterial amount of equity securities  which are also reported at fair value 

table of contents

sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the adoption of sfas did not materially change the approach or methods we utilize for determining fair value measurements or the fair values derived under those methods 
definition of fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and  therefore  represents an exit price  not an entry price 
the exit price objective applies regardless of a reporting entity s intent and or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
an active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
a quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment 
pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established  the characteristics specific to the transaction  and overall market conditions 
valuation techniques valuation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types the market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables or matrix pricing 
market multiples might lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable 
the selection of where within the range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment  considering both quantitative and qualitative factors specific to the measurement 
matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but comparing the securities to benchmark or comparable securities 
the income approach converts future amounts  such as cash flows or earnings  to a single present amount  or a discounted amount 
income approach techniques rely on current market expectations of future amounts 
examples of income approach valuation techniques include present value techniques  option pricing models that incorporate present value techniques  and the multi period excess earnings method 
the cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset  or the current replacement cost 
that is  from the perspective of a market participant seller  the price that would be received for the asset is determined based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility 
we use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort 
in some cases  a single valuation technique will be appropriate for example  when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities 
in other cases  multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate 
if we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value  we evaluate and weigh the results  as appropriate  considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results 
a fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the selection of the valuation method s to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued 
for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value  we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  and to a lesser extent  the income approach 
we believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach  considering the type of investments we hold 
our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs 
when markets are less active  brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker 
in weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value  we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions 
we also consider the nature of the quote  particularly whether the quote is an indicative price or a binding offer 
if prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets  adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value 
when relevant market data is unavailable  which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty  the income approach can  in appropriate circumstances  provide a more appropriate fair value 
during  we have applied valuation techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those techniques used at year end due to recent market conditions  the mix and availability of observable inputs for valuation techniques have been volatile  and the risk inherent in the inputs is elevated relative to prior periods 
inputs to valuation techniques inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities  including assumptions about risk  for example  the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as a pricing model and or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
inputs may be observable or unobservable 
observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
observable inputs which we utilize to determine the fair values of our investments and derivative financial instruments include indicative broker prices and prices obtained from external pricing services 
at december   approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on active trades and or broker quotes or prices obtained from pricing services that generally use observable inputs in their valuation techniques  with no additional adjustments to the prices 
these assets were classified as either level or level  with the categorization dependent on whether the price was for an actual representative sale  for identical assets actively traded  and or the quote binding or non binding 
we generally obtain  on average  one quote per financial instrument 
we review the prices obtained to ensure they are consistent with a variety of observable market inputs and to verify the validity of a security s price 
these inputs  along with our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates  will be considered in determining whether the quoted or indicated price  as well as the change in price from quarter to quarter  are valid 
on selected securities where there is not an indicated price or where we cannot validate the price  some combination of market inputs may be used to determine a price using a pricing matrix  or we may use pricing inputs from a comparable security 
at december   we valued approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities using this method 
these assets were classified as level the parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis  as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing 
changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies  rather  the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions 
we consider transactions in inactive or disorderly markets to be less representative of fair value 
we use all available observable inputs when measuring fair value  but when significant other unobservable inputs and adjustments are necessary  we classify these assets as level 
table of contents 
index to financial statements inputs that may be used include the following benchmark yields treasury and swap curves transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades broker dealer quotes and pricing security cash flows and structures recent issuance supply sector and issuer level spreads credit ratings maturity weighted average life seasoning capital structure security optionality corporate actions underlying collateral prepayment speeds loan performance delinquencies public covenants comparative bond analysis derivative spreads third party pricing sources relevant reports issued by analysts and rating agencies the overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price 
these adjustments may be made when  in our judgment  certain features of the financial instrument  such as its complexity or the market in which the financial instrument is traded such as counterparty  credit  concentration  or liquidity  require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources 
additionally  an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument 
we analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the london interbank offered rate libor setting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives fair values 
if counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the libor based fair value obtained from our pricing sources  we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources 
in regards to our own credit risk component  we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the libor based valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit risk 
certain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity 
for these securities  we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs  including valuations based on estimates of future profitability  to estimate the fair value 
additionally  we may obtain prices from independent third party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities 
key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market 
as of december   the key assumptions we generally used to estimate the fair value of these types of securities included those listed below 
where appropriate  we have noted the assumption used for the prior period as well as the reason for the change 
risk free interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities 
this compares to interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities used at december  current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points were added to the risk free rate to reflect the lack of liquidity 
we used spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points at december  the changes were based 
table of contents 
index to financial statements on observable market spreads 
newly issued private placement securities have historically offered yield premiums of basis points over comparable newly issued public securities 
an additional five basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments  consistent with december  additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for certain industries and for individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 
increasing the basis points added to the risk free rate for lack of liquidity by basis points  increasing the five basis points added to the risk free rates for foreign investments by one basis point  and increasing the additional basis points added to each industry considered to be of greater risk by one basis point would have decreased the december  fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio by approximately million 
we believe this range of variability is appropriate  and although the current market is very volatile  historically the inputs noted have generally not deviated outside the range provided 
we regularly test the validity of the fair values determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the prices of assets sold to the fair values reported for the assets in the immediately preceding reporting period 
historically  our realized gains or losses on dispositions of investments have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodologies described above  which  combined with the results of our testing  indicates to us that our pricing methodologies are appropriate 
fair value hierarchy financial instruments measured at fair value are categorized into a three level classification 
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of a financial instrument is used to categorize the instrument and reflects the judgment of management 
financial assets and liabilities presented at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets generally are categorized as follows level inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
level inputs other than quoted prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
level inputs include  for example  indicative prices obtained from brokers or pricing services validated to other observable market data and quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities 
level inputs reflect our best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
generally  assets and liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category are comprised of certain mortgage and asset backed securities  certain corporate fixed maturity securities  certain private equity investments  and certain derivatives 
financial assets and liabilities presented at fair value and categorized as level are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value 
the inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument in a current period transaction  and outputs represent an exit price and expected future cash flows 
unobservable inputs are primarily internally derived credit spread assumptions and lack of liquidity assumptions and are unobservable due to the lack of an active market pertaining to these securities 
as of december   approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as level  percent as level  and percent as level during  we transferred million of fixed maturity securities into level and million of fixed maturity securities out of level the reclassifications between levels resulted primarily from a change in observability of three inputs used to determine fair values of the securities reclassified transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades  broker dealer quotes and pricing  primarily related to the lack of an active and orderly market  and comparable bond metrics from which to perform an analysis 
for fair value measurements of financial instruments that were transferred either into or out of level  we reflect the transfers using the fair value at the beginning of the period 
we believe this allows for

our review procedures include  but are not limited to  monthly meetings of certain members of our senior management personnel to review reports on the entire portfolio  identifying investments with changes in market value of five percent or more  investments with changes in rating either by external rating agencies or internal analysts  investments segmented by issuer  industry  and foreign exposure levels  and any other relevant investment information to help identify our exposure to possible credit losses 
we also determine if our investment portfolio is overexposed to an issuer that is showing warning signs of deterioration and  if so  we make no further purchases of that issuer s securities and may seek opportunities to sell securities we hold from that issuer to reduce our exposure 
we monitor below investment grade fixed maturity securities as to individual exposures and in comparison to the entire portfolio as an additional credit risk management strategy  looking specifically at our exposure to individual securities currently classified as below investment grade 
in determining current and future business prospects and cash availability  we consider the parental support of an issuer in our analysis but do not rely heavily on this support 
we use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation 
mortgage loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and the overall loan portfolio  considering the value of the underlying collateral 
based on our review of the entire investment portfolio  individual investments may be added to or removed from our watch list  which is a list of investments subject to enhanced monitoring and a more intensive review 
if we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value  and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period to the extent of the decline in value 
if the decline is considered temporary  the investment continues to be carefully monitored 
these controls have been established to identify our exposure to possible credit losses and are intended to give us the ability to respond rapidly 
changes in the fair values of fixed maturity securities and derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges  other than declines that are determined to be other than temporary  are reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
if we subsequently determine that any of these securities are other than temporarily impaired  the impairment loss is reported as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income 
the recognition of the impairment loss does not affect total stockholders equity to the extent that the decline in value had been previously reflected in other comprehensive income 
mortgage loans are not

there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities the assessment of a borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations will change 
the economic outlook  either domestic or foreign  may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated  and as such  the investment may not recover in value 
new information may become available concerning the security  such as disclosure of accounting irregularities  fraud  or corporate governance issues 
significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry 
significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased 
adverse rating agency actions may occur 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans for our employees  including non qualified pension plans

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further discussion 
our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
we also use  as applicable  expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits  which reflects a health care cost trend rate 
the assumptions chosen for our pension and opeb plans generally use consistent methodology but reflect the differences in the plan obligations 
the assumptions are reviewed annually  and we use a december measurement date for each of our plans 
the discount rate assumptions and expected long term rate of return assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans 
in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and opeb plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
discount rate assumptions the discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value 
we set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our retirement related benefit plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs

reducing the discount rate assumption by basis points would have resulted in an increase in our pension expense of approximately million  before tax  and an increase in our benefit obligation of approximately million as of december   resulting in an after tax decrease in stockholders equity of approximately million as of december  a basis point reduction in the discount rate assumption would not change our annual opeb costs 
increasing the discount rate assumption by basis points would have resulted in a decrease in our pension expense of approximately million  before tax  and a decrease in our benefit obligation of approximately million as of december   resulting in an after tax increase in stockholders equity of approximately million as of december  a basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would not change our annual opeb costs 
long term rate of return assumptions the long term rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid 
we use a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on pension plan assets 
the investment portfolio for our us pension plans contains a diversified blend of domestic and international large cap  mid cap  and small cap equity securities  investment grade and below investment grade fixed income securities  private equity funds of funds  and hedge funds of funds 
assets for our uk pension plan are invested in pooled funds  with approximately percent in diversified growth assets including global equities  hedge funds  commodities  below investment grade fixed income securities  and currencies 
the remainder of the assets for our uk plan is predominantly invested in fixed interest uk corporate bonds and index linked uk government bonds 
assets for our opeb plan are invested primarily within life insurance contracts issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries 
the terms of these contracts are consistent in all material respects with those the subsidiary offers to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated 
we believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector  with no potential risk concentrations in any one category 
our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance and evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists 
the methodology underlying the return assumption included the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as long term rates of return  volatility of returns  and the correlation of returns between various asset classes 
the expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan s strategic asset allocation 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements  periodic asset liability studies  and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 
risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status  and corporate financial condition 
the long term rate of return on assets used in the net periodic pension costs for our us qualified defined benefit pension plan for and was percent for both years 
the long term rate of return on asset assumption used for and for our uk pension plan was percent and percent  respectively  and for our opeb plan  percent for both years 
the actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period  adjusted for contributions and benefit payments 
changing the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets by basis points would have changed our pension plan expense by approximately million before tax  but our opeb plan expense would not change 
a lower rate of return on plan assets increases our expense

index to financial statements benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets the market related value equals the fair value of assets  determined as of the measurement date 
the assets are not smoothed for purposes of sfas the expected return on assets  therefore  fully recognizes all asset gains and losses  including changes in fair value  through the measurement date 
the fair value of our plan assets is determined in accordance with sfas during  the fair value of our plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan declined million  or approximately percent 
the fair value of plan assets for our uk pension plan declined million  or approximately percent  during although the effect of these declines had no impact on our net periodic pension costs  the unfavorable rate of return on plan assets in increases our net periodic pension costs for we expect that our pension costs will be approximately million higher than our pension costs for we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of a prolonged market decline 
our pension and opeb plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss and an unrecognized prior service credit  which represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses and the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense 
as of december   the unrecognized net loss for these two items combined was approximately million compared to million at december  the increase is primarily due to the unfavorable rate of return on plan assets in and to the decrease in the year end discount rate for our us pension plans 
prior to the adoption of sfas  unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits were amortized as a component of pension expense but were not reported in companies balance sheets 
sfas requires that actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost as of the adoption date of sfas be recognized as components of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the unrecognized gains or losses will be amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive income and included as a component of the net benefit cost  as they were prior to the adoption of sfas our   and pension and opeb expense includes million  million  and million  respectively  of amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial loss and prior service credit 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans  which is million at december   will be amortized over the average future working life of pension plan participants  currently estimated at years for us participants and years for uk participants 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million for our opeb plan will be amortized over the average future working life of opeb plan participants  currently estimated at years  to the extent the loss is outside of a corridor established in accordance with gaap 
the corridor is established based on the greater of percent of the plan assets or percent of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
at december   none of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor 
the fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan was million at december   compared to million at year end this decline in fair value of plan assets  as well as the decrease in the discount rate  more than offset the effect of the plan contribution during  resulting in a year end deficit funding level in the plan of million as of december   compared to a deficit of million as of december  the fair value of plan assets in our opeb plan was million at december  and these assets represent life insurance reserves to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our opeb plan 
our opeb plan represents a non vested  non guaranteed obligation  and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits  which are comprised of retiree life  medical  and dental benefits 
it is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our opeb plan 
we expect to receive subsidies under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of to partially offset these payments 
our expected return on plan assets and discount rate discussed above will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our us pension and opeb plans because we have met all minimum funding requirements set forth by erisa 
we had no regulatory contribution requirements for and  however  we elected to make voluntary contributions of million and million  respectively  to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan 
we expect to make a voluntary contribution of approximately million in  based on current tax law 

table of contents 
index to financial statements during  the federal government enacted the pension protection act of which requires companies to fully fund defined benefit pension plans over a seven year period 
we have evaluated this requirement and have made estimates of amounts to be funded in the future 
based on this assessment  we do not believe that the funding requirements of the pension protection act will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
the fair value of plan assets for our uk pension plan was million at december   compared to million at december  the uk pension plan has a deficit of million at december   compared to million at december  we contribute to the plan in accordance with a schedule of contributions which requires that we contribute to the plan at the rate of at least percent of employee salaries  sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation 
during  we made a required contribution of million 
during  we made a required contribution of million 
we anticipate that we will make contributions during of approximately million 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowance relates primarily to assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards and assets for our basis in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are not likely to be realized in the future based on our expectations using currently available evidence 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we have considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we most likely would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the evaluation of a tax position under fin is a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
if a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured under fin  the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective 
we believe that tax positions have been reflected in our financial statements at appropriate amounts in conformity with fin

index to financial statements also affecting comparability of our financial results between years is the fluctuation in the british pound sterling to dollar exchange rate 
the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling 
in periods when the pound weakens  translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period 
in periods when the pound strengthens  translating pounds into dollars increases current period results in relation to the prior period 
however  it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency 
except for a limited number of transactions  we do not actually convert pounds into dollars 
as a result  we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk because of the volatility in the weighted average pound dollar exchange rate during the last three years  results translated into dollars are not comparable between years 
our weighted average pound dollar exchange rate was   and for the years ended   and  respectively

premium income in the individual disability closed block segment decreased in and  as expected in this closed block of business 
net investment income is marginally lower in relative to the prior year 
our portfolio yield has increased slightly year over year due to the investment of new cash at higher rates than that of prior periods  particularly during the last two quarters of we also received fewer bond call premiums in relative to prior year periods  and the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities declined in relative to the preceding year 
the weaker pound in relative to also unfavorably affected translated results for net investment income 
somewhat mitigating the impact of these items is continued growth in the level of invested assets 
net investment income increased in relative to the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to growth in invested assets  partially offset by a lower yield due to the investment of new cash at lower rates than that of our existing portfolio yield and a decline in the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities 
the pound strengthened during relative to  which favorably affected translated results for net investment income 
we reported a net realized investment loss of million in compared to a loss of million in and a gain of million in included in realized investment losses are million of net realized investment losses from sales and write downs of investments

during  changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative resulted in net realized losses of million compared to net realized losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the dig issue b losses in both and resulted primarily from a widening of credit spreads in the overall investment market 

table of contents 
index to financial statements dig issue b relates to one modified coinsurance arrangement entered into in wherein we assumed the profits and losses related to a closed block of individual disability business 
dig issue b requires us to include in our realized investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us 
however  neither party can unilaterally terminate the reinsurance agreement except in extreme circumstances resulting from regulatory supervision  delinquency proceedings  or other direct regulatory action 
cash settlements or collateral related to this embedded derivative are not required at any time during the reinsurance contract or at termination of the reinsurance contract  and any accumulated embedded derivative gain or loss reduces to zero over time as the reinsured business winds down 
we therefore view dig issue b as a reporting requirement that will not result in a permanent reduction of assets or stockholders equity

sales do not correspond to premium income or fee income reported as revenue in accordance with gaap 
this is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium or fee income over a month period  while premium income and fee income reported in our financial statements are reported on an as earned basis rather than an annualized basis and also include renewals and persistency of in force policies written in prior years as well as current new sales 
premiums for fully insured products are reported as premium income 
fees for aso products those where the risk and responsibility for funding claim payments remain with the customer and we only provide services are included in other income 
sales  persistency of the existing block of business  and the effectiveness of the renewal program are indicators of growth in our premium and fee income 
trends in new sales  as well as existing market share  also indicate our potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new product offerings 
sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions 
we intend to continue with our disciplined approach to pricing and also with our strategy of developing a more balanced business mix 
this strategy is expected to result in a lower premium persistency or market share  particularly in the large case unum us group market  but historically the profitability of business that terminates has generally been lower than the profitability of retained business

a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures of operating revenue and operating income or operating loss differ from revenue and income loss from continuing operations before income tax as presented in our consolidated operating results and in income statements prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of before tax realized investment gains and losses 
we measure segment performance for purposes of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  excluding realized investment gains and losses because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and the underlying trends in the businesses 
our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains and losses  and a long term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business 
realized investment gains and losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments 
however  income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of overall profitability

net investment income declined in in comparison to the prior year due primarily to a lower yield on assets supporting this line of business resulting from the investment of new cash at a lower yield than that of the existing portfolio and also due to a decrease in bond call premiums

other income includes aso fees of million and million for and  respectively 
the benefit ratio for was lower than the benefit ratio for the prior year  excluding the revision to our estimate for the claim reassessment costs  due primarily to a higher rate of claim recoveries in group long term disability and lower paid claims in short term disability 
annual claim incidence rates for both group long term and short term disability are slightly lower than the prior year  with no unusual trends noted by sector or by case size 
an increase in incidence rates for group short term disability generally precedes an increase in long term disability submitted incidence 
interest and debt expense related to the debt issued by tailwind holdings decreased from the prior year due to a decrease in the variable rate of interest during compared to and a decrease in the amount of outstanding debt resulting from principal payments made during and the deferral of acquisition costs was generally consistent with the prior year 
amortization was higher in relative to the prior year due to an increase in amortization related to internal replacement transactions that result in a policy that is substantially changed 
these transactions are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original policy and the issuance of a new policy 
the other expense ratio increased in compared to the prior year due primarily to the decline in premium income and an increase in policy maintenance expenses and product service and development costs 
also contributing to the increase in the other expense ratio was the expense related to the broker compensation settlement previously discussed  of which million was included in expenses for group disability 
as discussed under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements  certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in group disability business 
components of claims experience  including  but not limited to  incidence and recovery rates  may be worse than we expect 
both economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence 
disability claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by  among other factors  the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence 
the relationship between these and other factors and overall incidence is very complex and will vary due to contract design features and the degree of expertise within the insuring organization to price  underwrite  and adjudicate the claims 
adjustments to reserve amounts may be required if there are changes in assumptions regarding the incidence of claims or the rate of recovery  as well as persistency  mortality  and interest rates used in calculating the reserve amounts 
within the group disability market  pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates 
however  these actions take time to implement  and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices 
in addition  changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time

premium persistency and case persistency were both consistent with our expectations given our business mix strategy

periods of economic downturns have historically affected disability claim incidence rates and  to a lesser extent  disability claim recovery rates in certain sectors of the market 
the current downturn may lead to a similar pattern of claim incidence or recoveries

we experienced a slight increase in claim incidence levels during the fourth quarter of  but not in any particular market sector or case size 
it is not determinable as to whether this increase is economically related

the improvement in the accident  sickness  and disability line of business resulted from the continued favorable experience related to several new products introduced between and the life line of business benefit ratio was higher in relative to the prior year due to a higher level of death claims and a higher average claim cost 
the cancer and critical illness product line reported a higher benefit ratio in relative to the prior year due primarily to unfavorable claim experience associated with the older cancer products

the cancer and critical illness product line also reported a slightly lower benefit ratio in relative to the other expense ratio for increased in comparison to due primarily to our investment in brand and product promotion and the development of additional product offerings

the number of new accounts and the new account annualized sales premium per case sold both increased over the prior year 
sales in increased in comparison to primarily due to sales increases in the public sector market for educators and in the commercial market segment for employee groups with less than lives

index to financial statements segment outlook throughout  we focused on sales and distribution growth by accelerating recruiting and development  capitalizing on sales opportunities where we have less market share  and assessing emerging distribution opportunities 
during  we will seek to continue to expand our distribution through recruiting  development  and training programs 
we intend to focus our marketing resources on both existing accounts and new employers to maintain our in force premium and generate sales opportunities 
we believe sales and premium growth will be driven by the growth and productivity of our agency sales system  as well as continued product and brand development 
we will also continue our collaboration with our unum us business partners for marketing and product development opportunities 
periods of economic downturns have historically had minimal impact on the operations of colonial life  due primarily to a diversified product portfolio that is designed with short duration  indemnity benefits 
as of year end  we had not experienced an increase in claim incidence levels  on a seasonally adjusted basis  in the aggregate or in any particular market sector 
we expect to experience some near term impact on sales and premium growth if current economic conditions affect the buying patterns of employees or cause employers to defer introduction of new plans 
we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risk to an economic slowdown or recession and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly 
our outlook for is for the continuance of high levels of profitability in this segment  but with margins decreasing modestly over time as the benefit ratio returns to more historic levels 
premium growth in is expected to be slightly less than due to slower sales trends 
individual disability closed block segment the individual disability closed block segment generally consists of those individual disability policies in force before the substantial changes in product offerings  pricing  distribution  and underwriting  which generally occurred during the period through a small amount of new business continued to be sold after these changes  but we stopped selling new policies in this segment at the beginning of other than update features contractually allowable on existing policies 
as previously discussed  effective with the fourth quarter of  we reclassified the assets  non recourse debt  and associated capital of northwind holdings from our former corporate segment to the individual disability closed block segment

year ended december  compared with year ended december  the decrease in premium income for relative to the prior year is due to the expected run off of this block of closed business due to persistency and policy maturities 
net investment income decreased in compared to the prior year due to a decrease in bond call premiums  a lower level of assets supporting this closed block of business  and a decline in the portfolio yield for this segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an intercompany reinsurance transaction which allowed us to release excess statutory capital previously supporting this reinsured closed block of business 
as a result  the capital allocated to our individual disability closed block segment declined  with a resulting decrease in net investment income due to the lower asset levels needed to support allocated capital 
because this is an intercompany reinsurance arrangement  reported results remain unchanged for this segment other than the lower net investment income 

table of contents 
index to financial statements other income includes the underlying results of certain blocks of reinsured business  including the net investment income of portfolios held by those ceding companies to support the block we have reinsured 
the net investment income for those blocks of reinsured business also declined relative to prior years  primarily due to a lower level of assets 
interest and debt expense is related to the northwind holdings debt issued in the fourth quarter of the interest adjusted loss ratio was lower in compared to the prior year  excluding the decrease in our claim reassessment reserve estimate  due primarily to lower average size of new claims and fewer reopened claims 
the other expense ratio is higher for relative to the prior year due to a million litigation settlement as well as higher legal fees related to two pending cases 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the decrease in premium income for relative to is due to the expected decline in this block of closed business  as well as an adjustment to premium income for a small block of ceded business for which the contract was modified during partially offsetting these declines is an increase in premium income due to the reinsurance recapture  in the third quarter of  of a small block of business  with an effective date of january   and annualized premium income of approximately million 
neither the contract modification nor the recapture had a material effect on operating results for this segment 
net investment income decreased slightly in compared to due to a decrease in the level of assets supporting this business and the decline in the portfolio yield rate 
the lower asset levels were primarily the result of the previously discussed intercompany reinsurance arrangement which lowered the statutory capital requirements for the reinsured block of business 
the interest adjusted loss ratio was lower in than the ratio for  excluding the revisions to the claim reassessment reserve estimate noted previously  due primarily to a higher rate of claim recoveries and a lower rate of submitted claims 
segment outlook as a result of the decline in capital allocated to this segment  net investment income has decreased in relative to due to the lower asset levels needed to support allocated capital 
net investment income was also negatively impacted in by a reduced level of bond call premiums  relative to recent historical experience  as a result of the volatile capital market conditions and uncertain economic environment  and it is likely that this trend may continue in we also expect that operating revenue and income will decline over time as this closed block of business winds down 
we believe that the interest adjusted loss ratio for this block of business will be relatively flat over the long term  but the segment may experience quarterly volatility 
claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time 
our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period 
it is possible  however  that variability in our reserve assumptions could result in a material impact on our reserve levels 
corporate and other segment as previously discussed  effective with the fourth quarter of  we aggregated our former other segment and corporate segment into one reporting segment 
subsequent to that aggregation  additional modifications to the reporting segment included the transfer of assets  non recourse debt  and associated capital of tailwind holdings and northwind holdings out of corporate and other into unum us and individual disability closed block  respectively  and the transfer of excess assets  capital  and the associated investment income from unum uk into corporate and other

segment outlook specific defaults within our investment portfolio are unforeseeable 
we have tested whether our capital plan for has sufficient cushion to absorb possible losses 
because we currently have a margin of excess holding company liquidity and statutory capital above our capital management target guidelines  we believe we are well positioned for the economic downturn 
it is possible  however  that defaults in our investment portfolio will result in realized investment losses  reduced net investment income  and lower statutory capital

investments overview we believe that our investment portfolio  which consists primarily of fixed income securities  is positioned to moderate the potential impact of an economic slowdown on our financial position or operating results 
our portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector 
over the past few years  we have actively reduced our exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities  although additional downgrades may occur during an economic slowdown 
we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur 
we have no exposure to subprime mortgages  alt a loans  or collateralized debt obligations in our asset backed or mortgage backed securities portfolios

the weighted average rating of the underlying securities  absent the guaranty insurance policy  is a we held million fair value million amortized cost of perpetual debentures  or hybrid securities  that generally have no fixed maturity date 
interest on these securities due on any payment date may be deferred by the issuer 
the interest payments are generally deferrable only to the extent that the issuer has suspended dividends or other distributions or payments to any of its shareholders or any other perpetual debt instrument 
below is a summary of our formal investment policy  including the overall quality and diversification objectives 
the majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of our portfolios 
the long term nature of our insurance liabilities also allows us to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns 
a maximum of percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below investment grade securities  percent in equity type instruments  up to percent in private placements  and percent in commercial mortgage loans 
the remaining assets can be held in publicly traded investment grade corporate securities  mortgage backed securities  bank loans  asset backed securities  government and government agencies  and municipal securities 
we intend to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities  in the aggregate  to within a range of ten percent of the liability duration 
the weighted average credit quality rating of the portfolio should be bbb or higher 
the maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries and is more restrictive than the five percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments our insurance subsidiaries are allowed to own 
these internal limits are as follows rating internal limit in millions aaa a bbb bbb bbb bb bb bb b the portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines 
derivative instruments may be used to hedge interest rate risk and foreign currency risk and match liability duration and cash flows consistent with the plan reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
asset mix guidelines and limits are established by us  reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors  and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
the allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification  on a weekly basis  by an investment subcommittee appointed by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
these actions are also reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
we review these investment policies and guidelines annually  or more frequently if deemed necessary  and recommend adjustments  as appropriate

change in fair value of dig issue b derivative we report changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement as realized investment gains and losses  as required under the provisions of dig issue b losses in both and resulted primarily from a widening of credit spreads in the overall investment market  as previously discussed 
dig issue b requires us to include in our realized investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us

generally  below investment grade fixed maturity securities are more likely to develop credit concerns 
in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  we utilize a formal  well defined  and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio

our mortgage asset backed securities were approximately billion and billion on an amortized cost basis at december  and  respectively 
at december   the mortgage asset backed securities had an average life of years  effective duration of years  and a weighted average credit rating of aaa 
the mortgage asset backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services 
the primary risk involved in investing in mortgage asset backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment 
we use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
the timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income 
we recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities 
actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically  and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected 
the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis  and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income

index to financial statements as of december   our exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities was  million  approximately percent of the carrying value of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans 
below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid 
additional downgrades may occur  but we do not anticipate any liquidity problem caused by our investments in below investment grade securities  nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity 
we have a significant interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  a special purpose entity which is a collateralized bond obligation asset trust cbo in which we hold interests in several of the tranches and for which we act as investment manager of the underlying high yield securities 
this entity is a cash flow cbo and was fully funded at the time of issuance 
our potential losses in this cbo are limited to our investment in the entity 
our investment in this entity is reported at fair value with fixed maturity securities in the consolidated balance sheets

our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans 
we expect that we will continue to add investments in this category either through the secondary market or through loan originations 
we believe our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types 
the incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity is currently low 
due to conservative underwriting  we expect the level of delinquencies and problem loans to remain low relative to the industry 
at december   delinquent mortgage loans  or those past due more than days as to interest or principal payments  totaled million and were considered impaired loans 
the impaired loans were deemed permanently impaired and are reported at the estimated net realizable value 
we had no delinquent or impaired mortgage loans at december  and no valuation allowance for mortgage loans at december  or derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to manage reinvestment risk  duration  and currency risk 
historically  we have utilized interest rate futures contracts  current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps  current and forward currency swaps  interest rate forward contracts  forward treasury locks  currency forward contracts  and forward contracts on specific fixed income securities 
all of these freestanding derivative transactions are hedging in nature and not speculative

almost all hedging transactions are associated with the individual and group long term care and the individual and group disability products 
all other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes 
our current credit exposure on derivatives  which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held  was million at december  the carrying value of fixed maturity securities pledged as collateral to our counterparties was million at december  we believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties  all of whom are rated a or better by both moody s and s p

index to financial statements liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations  principally in our insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash 
debt and or securities offerings provide an additional source of liquidity 
cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  and taxes  as well as purchases of new investments 
we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations 
we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business 
however  further deterioration in the credit market could delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner  which may negatively impact our cash flows 
furthermore  if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries  this will negatively impact statutory capital  which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies 
a reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay our stockholder dividends or meet our debt and other payment obligations 
our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments  and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities 
a decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations 
however  our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is consistent  even during cycles of economic downturns  which serves to minimize liquidity risk 
we have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by erisa 
we expect to make a voluntary contribution of approximately million in to our u 
s qualified defined benefit pension plan  based on current tax law 
we have evaluated the pension protection act of which requires companies to fully fund defined benefit pension plans over a seven year period and have made estimates of amounts to be funded in the future 
based on this assessment  we do not believe that the funding requirements of the pension protection act will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we also contribute to our uk pension plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation 
we anticipate that we will make a contribution of approximately million during in the near term  we expect that our need for external financing is small  but changes in our business as noted above could increase our need 
our short term debt repayment requirements for can be met through existing cash flows 
we currently anticipate that we may issue long term debt of million to million during  depending on market conditions and the availability and cost of financing 
in light of the recent credit market turmoil  we have implemented a more conservative cash management strategy with respect to our securities lending and commercial paper investment programs 
in addition  we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility and an open shelf registration that we can utilize as needed to provide additional liquidity and financial flexibility 
we believe our cash resources are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next months and that our current level of holding company liquidity can be utilized to mitigate potential losses from defaults 
during  we intend to retain sufficient capital in our traditional us insurance subsidiaries to maintain a weighted average rbc ratio in excess of our stated long term objective of percent 
we also intend to maintain our leverage ratio at or slightly below our target levels and maintain  as a minimum threshold  liquidity at our holding companies sufficient to cover one year of fixed charges  measured as interest expense plus common stock dividends

the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations has not  nor is it expected to  materially affect liquidity and capital resources 
operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million and  million for the comparable periods of and  respectively 
operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income  offset by payments of claims  commissions  expenses  and income taxes 
premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales  but on renewals of existing business  renewal price increases  and stable persistency 
investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and on the level of portfolio yield rates 
increases in commissions and operating expenses are attributable primarily to new sales growth and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business 
the level of paid claims is due partially to the growth and aging of the block of business and also to the general economy  as previously discussed in the operating results by segment 
included in operating cash flows for   and are voluntary pension contributions to our us qualified defined benefit plan of million  million  and million  respectively 
we also had increased cash inflows of approximately million in due to the reinsurance recapture of a small block of individual disability business 
the fluctuation in the income tax adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to the deferred tax asset established during related to the change in the fair value of the dig issue b derivative and a tax benefit recognized during which resulted from the reversal of tax liabilities related to group relief benefits recognized from the use of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction 
the decrease in the other  net adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities in compared to the prior two years is due primarily to the and reclassification of costs related to early retirement of debt to cash flows from financing activities 
investing cash flows investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments 
investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments 
net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to  million and  million for the comparable periods of and  respectively 
proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities in were consistent with the level of primarily due to an increase in bond maturities and bonds that were called at par  offset by a decrease in sales of fixed maturity securities  a lower level of proceeds from mortgage backed securities prepayments  and the translation of investment proceeds from our uk operations at lower exchange rates 
proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments decreased in primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of common stock investments and a reduction in commercial mortgage loan maturities and prepayments 
the reduction in cash flows received on other investments was partially offset by higher proceeds in from terminations of derivatives within our cash flow hedging programs 
purchases of available for sale securities decreased during relative to in part due to the lower exchange rate for translation of purchases within our uk operations and to investing more heavily in short term investments rather than fixed maturity securities during the last half of during the first half of  we invested more heavily in fixed maturity securities as we continued to transition out of short term investments into floating rate fixed maturity securities to support the floating rate debt issued during the fourth quarter of

net purchases of short term investments increased during compared to as a result of the liquidity needed for our capital redeployment plan previously discussed 
during the fourth quarter of  we issued million of debt and invested the proceeds in floating rate bonds and short term investments

the payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary s board of directors 
the ability of unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries and or finance subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval generally depends on the level of earnings of those insurance subsidiaries as calculated under law 
in addition to regulatory restrictions  the amount of dividends that may be paid by insurance subsidiaries will depend on additional factors  such as rbc ratios  funding growth objectives at an affiliate level  and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings 
insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non insurance subsidiaries except where the non insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by unum group

financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency s view of the overall financial strength capital levels  earnings  growth  investments  business mix  operating performance  and market position of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis

coincident with the ratings action  the company s outlook from s p was revised from positive to stable 
there have been no other changes in any of the rating agencies outlook statements or ratings during or prior to the date of this filing 
agency ratings are not directed toward the holders of our securities and are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold our securities 
each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be regarded as an independent assessment  not conditional on any other rating 
given the dynamic nature of the ratings process  changes by these or other rating agencies may or may not occur in the near term 
based on our ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies concerning our improved insurance risk profile  our financial flexibility  our operating performance  and the quality of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any negative actions from any of the four rating agencies related to either unum group s current issuer credit ratings or the financial strength ratings of its insurance subsidiaries 
however  in the event that we are unable to meet the rating agency specific guideline values to maintain our current ratings  including but not limited to maintenance of our capital management metrics at the threshold values stated and maintenance of our financial flexibility and operational consistency  we could be placed on a negative credit watch  with a potential for a downgrade to both our issuer credit ratings and our financial strength ratings 
see ratings contained herein in item and risk factors contained herein in item a for further discussion

index to financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to various market risk exposures  including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
see investments contained herein in item and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate changes results from our holdings of financial instruments such as fixed rate investments  derivatives  and interest sensitive liabilities 
fixed rate investments include fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  policy loans  and short term investments 
fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities  and redeemable preferred stock  all of which are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
certain of our financial instruments  fixed maturity securities and derivatives  are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of these financial instruments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates may increase the net unrealized loss related to these financial instruments  but may improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on new purchases of fixed maturity securities 
conversely  a decline in interest rates may decrease the net unrealized loss  but new securities may be purchased at lower rates of return 
although changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities and derivatives due to changes in interest rates may impact amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets  these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments  terminate derivative positions  determine that an investment is other than temporarily impaired  or determine that a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge 
other fixed rate investments  such as mortgage loans and policy loans  are carried at amortized cost and unpaid balances  respectively  rather than fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
these investments may have fair values substantially higher or lower than the carrying values reflected in our balance sheets 
a change in interest rates could impact our financial position if we sold our mortgage loan investments at times of low market value 
a change in interest rates would not impact our financial position at repayment of policy loans  as ultimately the cash surrender values or death benefits would be reduced for the carrying value of any outstanding policy loans 
carrying amounts for short term investments approximate fair value  and we believe we have minimal interest rate risk exposure from these investments 
we believe that the risk of being forced to liquidate investments or terminate derivative positions is minimal  primarily due to the level of capital at our insurance subsidiaries  our holding company liquidity position  and our investment strategy which we believe provides for adequate cash flows to meet the funding requirements of our business 
we may in certain circumstances  however  need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements  changes in tax laws  rating agency decisions  and or unexpected changes in liquidity needs 
although the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk  the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk  which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment cash flows with amounts due under insurance contracts 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to minimize interest rate risk 
we model and test asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to our activities in derivative financial instruments 
we use current and forward interest rate swaps  currency forward contracts  forward treasury locks  and options on forward interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements short term and long term debt are not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
if we modify or replace existing short term or long term debt instruments at current market rates  we may incur a gain or loss on the transaction 
we believe our debt related risk to changes in interest rates is relatively minimal 
in the near term  we expect that our need for external financing is small  but changes in our business could increase our need 
our short term debt repayment requirements for can be met through existing cash flows 
we measure our financial instruments market risk related to changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates potential changes in fair values as of december  and based on a hypothetical immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the hypothetical potential changes in fair value of our financial instruments at december  and are shown as follows december  notional hypothetical in millions of dollars amount of derivatives fair value fv bp change in fv assets fixed maturity securities mortgage loans policy loans  net of reinsurance ceded liabilities unrealized adjustment to reserves  net of reinsurance ceded and other short term debt long term debt derivatives swaps forwards dig issue b embedded derivative

changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates may affect the fair value at which the item is reported in our consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding offsetting change reported in other comprehensive income or loss  net of deferred taxes 
the adjustment to reserves and other for unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the adjustments that would be necessary to deferred acquisition costs and policyholder liabilities if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the fixed maturity securities and derivatives had been realized 
changes in this adjustment are also reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss  net of deferred taxes 
the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of basis points in interest rates 
the effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgage backed securities was estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgage backed securities 
these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in the fair values shown in the chart above for all other items were determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because we actively manage our investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 
foreign currency risk the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rates primarily as they relate to the translation of the financial results of our uk operations 
fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our reported financial results 
we do not hedge against the possible impact of this risk 
because we do not actually convert pounds into dollars except for a limited number of transactions  we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk

dividends paid by unum limited are generally held at our uk finance subsidiary 
if these funds are repatriated to our us holding company  we would at that time be subject to foreign currency risk as the value of the dividend  when converted into us dollars  would be dependent upon the foreign exchange rate at the time of conversion 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to certain foreign investment securities denominated in local currencies and us dollar denominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries 
we use current and forward currency swaps and contracts to hedge or minimize the foreign exchange risk associated with these instruments

we employ a pyramid risk committee structure  beginning with unum group s board of director committees and cascading down to business unit risk committees  to govern our erm process and manage our risks in an integrated manner 
collectively  these committees are responsible for managing our strategic  market  credit  insurance  operational  capital and liquidity  and reputational risks 
business unit risk committees for each of our three primary business units as well as our corporate function are responsible for identifying  measuring  reporting  and managing insurance and operational risks within their respective areas  consistent with established corporate risk tolerance levels 
we manage insurance and operational risk at the business unit level  based on consistent principles and policies established at the corporate level 
internal quality controls are routinely monitored by the risk committees 
market and credit risk are jointly managed by our investment committee  which is also responsible for monitoring our investment risk appetite and ratifying investment transactions 
capital and liquidity risk is under the purview of the capital management committee  which is responsible for planning and monitoring capital allocation  financing  liquidity  and solvency considerations 
an executive risk management committee is responsible for overseeing our enterprise wide risk management program that is managed by our chief risk officer 
the executive management team is responsible for managing our strategic risk 
we provide an erm report to the audit committee of unum group s board of directors on a regular basis 
we believe that by effectively executing against these objectives we will be better positioned to fulfill our corporate mission  improve and protect shareholder value  and reduce reputational risk
