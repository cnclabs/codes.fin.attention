item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that judgments and estimates related to the following critical accounting policies could materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and assess the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors including the customer s financial condition and collection history  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory we estimate the carrying value of our inventory based upon historic usage and management s assumptions relating to projected customer purchases  product design changes and product obsolescence 
the changing technology markets that we supply also affect these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
we must estimate our income tax valuation allowance by assessing which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recovered in the future 
based on our assessment of the realization of these assets  we do not have a valuation allowance at december  in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  taxable income in prior carryback years and taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents amounted to  at december   a decrease of  from the december  level 
during  our continuing operations provided cash of  investing activities used cash of  financing activities used cash of  and discontinued operations used cash of  cash provided from continuing operations amounted to  in compared to  in operating cash flows during resulted mainly from net earnings of  and an increase of  for the non cash effects of depreciation  deferred income taxes  and stock compensation expense 
during  the overall components of net working capital remained level with the  decrease in accounts receivable from the amount was mainly due to a decrease in the current year s fourth quarter sales from the comparable period 
the inventory increase of  is mainly due to a combination of the lead times for certain raw material items and the necessary inventory to support the current level of shipments and backlog and to meet customer delivery requirements 
the decrease in accrued liabilities is mainly due to a  reduction in the key employee bonus plan accrual 
capital expenditures amounted to  in our budget for capital expenditures is approximately  the company s board of directors approved a special one time cash dividend in the amount of per share total amount  payable on october  to shareholders of record on october  we believe that based on our current working capital and the expected cash flows from operations  our resources are sufficient to meet our financial needs and to fund our capital expenditures for the projected levels of business in results of operations versus our net sales decreased  from the sales decrease was due to sales reductions in our standard product line of  and our transducer product line of  partially offset by a  sales increase in our high precision and high reliability product lines 
the lower sales in our standard product and transducer product lines were primarily due to a decrease in the number of units sold and  to a lesser extent  decreases in the average selling prices 
the higher sales in our high precision and high reliability product lines were mainly due to an increase in the number of units sold 
we continue to pursue sales of our more value added  higher performance and higher average selling price products included in our high precision product line

we reported an operating profit of  during  compared to an operating profit of  in the current year decrease in operating profit from last year results from the lower sales and corresponding decrease in gross profit of  offset in part by a  decrease in operating expenses 
interest income amounted to  in  compared to  in we reported a pre tax profit of  in compared to a pre tax profit  in for  we reported net earnings of  versus net earnings of  in off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash balances in excess of operating requirements are currently invested in money market accounts 
these money market accounts are subject to interest rate risk and interest income will fluctuate in relation to general money market rates 
based on the cash and cash equivalent balance at december   and assuming the balance was totally invested in money market instruments for the full year  a hypothetical point increase or decline in interest rates would result in an approximate  increase or decrease in interest income 
we purchase certain inventory from and sell product in foreign countries 
as these activities are currently transacted in us dollars  they are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
however  significant fluctuation in the currencies where we purchase inventory or sell product could make the us dollar equivalent of such transactions more or less favorable to us and the other involved parties
