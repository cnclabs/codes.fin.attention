overview we are a leading provider of medical devices in circulatory support and we offer a continuum of care in heart recovery to acute heart failure patients 
our strategy is focused on establishing heart recovery as the goal for all acute cardiac attacks 
our products are designed to enable the heart to rest  heal and recover by improving blood flow and or performing the pumping function of the heart 
we believe we are the only company with commercially available cardiac assist devices approved for heart recovery from all causes by the us food and drug administration  or fda and our products have been used to treat thousands of patients to date 
our products can be used in a broad range of clinical settings  including by heart surgeons for patients in profound shock and by interventional cardiologists for patients who are in pre shock or in need of prophylactic support in the cardiac catheterization lab  or cath lab 
our circulatory care products are designed to provide hemodynamic support for acute patients from the cath lab to the surgery suite  with a goal of heart recovery and sending the patient home with his or her native heart 
we believe heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for patients because it provides a better quality of life than alternatives 
in addition  we believe heart recovery is the most cost effective path for the healthcare system 
since  our executive team has focused our efforts on expanding our product portfolio 
we have significantly increased our product portfolio  which now includes several circulatory care products that either have been approved or cleared by the fda in the us  have received ce mark approval in europe  or have received registration or regulatory approval in numerous other countries 
we also have additional new circulatory care products in development 
our strategic focus and the driver of the most recent revenue growth in our business is the market penetration of our impella product  which received k clearance in june in addition to the k clearance  we are also conducting clinical trials of our impella for additional indications of use  with the goal of establishing impella as the standard of care in the cath lab 
we have found that the k clearance of our impella has significantly slowed our progress in completing the clinical trials  since our customers are now able to use the impella commercially outside of the clinical trials 
we recently received k clearance in april for our impella and impella ld devices  which are larger and provide more blood flow than the impella we are also currently in clinical trials with our impella and ld devices 
similar to our experience with the impella  we expect that the k clearance of the impella and ld will slow down our efforts to complete clinical trials with these devices 
in order for our manufacturing to meet the expected demand for our impella product  we have been increasing our inventory levels and implementing process improvements at our manufacturing facilities in aachen  germany  to increase the output that we can produce at the facility 
we also recently signed a lease for a facility in athlone  ireland  where we plan to establish a high throughput manufacturing facility for the production of our impella products in order to meet anticipated sales volumes of impella we expect our ireland facility to produce its first product for human use by the end of fiscal year revenues from our other heart recovery products have decreased recently as we have strategically shifted our sales and marketing efforts towards our impella products 
we expect that sales from these other products will have limited or no growth in the short term as we dedicate the majority of our focus and resources on our impella products 
we have from time to time engaged in console placement programs related to our ipulse consoles  in order to encourage utilization of our bvs and ab disposables 
we have also developed a portable driver for our ab product which received fda approval under a pma supplement in march this clearance allows for immediate commercial shipment of the device to us hospitals for in hospital and transport use 
the out of hospital use is being studied in a clinical trial to allow patients to go home while waiting for recovery 
we believe that the added mobility afforded by the portable driver will help our overall ab revenues 
our bvs product was launched years ago and revenue from this product has been declining as ab  our next generation product for heart recovery  is designed to provide a longer duration of support than the bvs and facilitates patient mobility in the hospital 
we expect revenue from bvs to continue to decline as our customers transition more to ab disposables and also as our new impella products  especially our recently cleared impella and ld devices  are introduced in the us we expect limited or no growth in our revenues from our ab business during fiscal as we continue to focus on our impella products 
we do not expect that revenues from sales of our replacement heart product  the abiocor  will be a material portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future as our primary strategic focus is centered around heart recovery for acute heart failure patients 
we did not recognize any abiocor revenue during the fiscal we have incurred net losses since our inception  including net losses of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect to incur additional net losses in the future as we continue to invest in research and development expenses related to our products  increase our inventory levels  and ramp up our manufacturing facility in ireland 

table of contents our financial condition has been bolstered by our public offering in august  which yielded us approximately million in net proceeds after deducting offering expenses 
we expect that our existing cash resources  together with our revenues  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  financial instruments  accrued expenses  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  stock based compensation  valuation of long lived assets and investments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimated 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
we also follow the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables when transactions include multiple elements 
revenue from product sales to new customers is deferred until training on the use of the products has occurred 
all costs related to product shipment are recognized at time of shipment 
we do not provide for rights of return to customers on product sales 
maintenance and service support contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
in limited instances  we rent console medical devices on a month to month basis or for a longer specified period of time to customers for which revenue is recognized as earned 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed 
under contracts in which we elect to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  we prospectively recognize revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as related research and development costs are incurred 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  delays in regulatory approval  other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary 
we performed our annual impairment review for fiscal as of october  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
in light of a decrease in our market capitalization since october  and the difficult worldwide economic conditions in recent months  we updated our impairment review as of march  and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
the carrying amount of goodwill at march  was million 
we estimate the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
the net book value of intangible assets at march  was million 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
although such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
warranties our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
although we have established extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  we record a warranty obligation related to anticipated product failure rates and product recalls 
our consoles are covered by a one year limited manufacturer s warranty 
we estimate and record a warranty obligation in cost of revenue at the time of shipment and we record any additional amounts when we determine that such costs are probable and we can reasonably estimate them 
historically  our warranty provision has not been substantial  however  our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of any product failures  including product recalls  exceeds our estimated warranty provision 
inventories we value our inventory of products held for sale at the lower of cost or current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down to its net realizable value any inventory believed to be impaired 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than projected demand  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely impact financial results for the period in which the additional excess or obsolete inventory is identified 
we recorded write downs of inventory in the amount of million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees  such as amounts due to clinical research organizations  professional service fees  such as fees of attorneys and accountants  fees of investigators in conjunction with clinical trials and third party expenses relating to marketing efforts associated with commercialization of our product and product candidates 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments and estimates based upon known facts and circumstances 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation in our statements of operations based on the fair value method in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment 
this expense is determined after consideration of several significant judgments and estimates 
the fair value of each stock option we granted is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of a valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of our stock 
the calculation of the fair value of the options is net of estimated forfeitures 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we estimated the average expected life based on historical experience of our option exercises 
forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures  adjusted to the extent historical forfeitures may not be indicative of forfeitures in the future 
in addition  an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because we do not pay dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at march   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  of approximately million and 
table of contents million  respectively  which begin to expire in fiscal additionally  at march   we had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in fiscal we acquired impella  a german based company  in may the utilization of pre acquisition nols of impella in future periods is also subject to certain statutory approvals and business requirements 
due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets  a valuation allowance of million at march  has been established to offset our net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax benefit  an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
additionally  the future utilization of our nol and research and development credit carry forwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under section of the internal revenue code due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future 
ownership changes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code  can limit the amount of nol carry forwards and research and development credit carry forwards that a company can use each year to offset future taxable income and taxes payable 
we believe that all of our federal and state nol s will be available for carryforward to future tax periods  subject to the statutory maximum carryforward limitation of any annual nol 
any future potential limitation to all or a portion of the nol or research and development credit carry forwards  before they can be utilized  would reduce our gross deferred tax assets 
we will monitor subsequent ownership changes  which could impose limitations in the future 
fair value measurements effective april   we adopted the provisions under sfas no 
 fair value measurements  as required for the valuation of our financial assets and liabilities 
however  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  deferred the effective date of sfas for one year as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
sfas no 
establishes a three level hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
in general  fair value determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability  and includes situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
the value of our level instruments was million and the value of our level investments was million as of march  financial instruments we entered into a convertible note purchase agreement with world heart corporation worldheart in december  a developer of implantable mechanical circulatory support systems for chronic heart failure patients 
under the agreement  we loaned million to worldheart  with the note and accrued interest  at per annum  convertible at our option into common stock of worldheart 
we advanced million of the loan in december with the remaining million advanced in january the conversion feature within the note was an embedded derivative instrument under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and accordingly  was separately valued within the carrying value of the note receivable 
we also received a warrant to purchase up to  shares of worldheart common stock 
the grant date fair values of the assets associated with the note receivable and the warrant  in excess of cash paid were deemed to be deferred income  as analogized to sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
similar to other loan fees  the deferred income related to grant date fair value of the note receivable and the warrant would be recognized over the life of the note receivable  if deemed to be realizable as a yield adjustment 
we initially recorded the derivative financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments were recorded as change in fair value of worldheart note receivable and warrant in the consolidated statements of operations 
the measurement of fair value was based on valuation methodologies considered appropriate by our management 
the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative and warrant was determined using the black scholes method 
because of inherent uncertainty of valuations of derivative instruments  estimated fair values may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market for the investment existed and these differences could have a material impact in the consolidated statements of operations 
in may  worldheart filed a form k disclosing that it had limited cash available to continue operations and that if it was unable to secure additional funding  it would be forced to take extraordinary business measures which could include filing for bankruptcy  ceasing operations and liquidating assets 
due to these events  we recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal relating to our note receivable to worldheart and our associated derivative instruments embedded conversion feature and warrant 
in july  worldheart completed the transactions contemplated by the recapitalization agreement dated june   as amended on july   we entered into with worldheart and the other parties named therein 
as a result of the transaction  we received million 
table of contents common shares of worldheart  which represented approximately of worldheart s issued and outstanding common shares following the transaction 
the shares were received as a result of our conversion of the full amount of principal and interest owed on the million convertible note issued in december  our release of the security interest in all of the assets of worldheart that secured the note  termination of the warrant we held to purchase million common shares of worldheart  forgiveness of other amounts owed to us by worldheart  the amendment of our rights with respect to the distribution of worldheart products  and the appointment of a director or observer to worldheart s board of directors 
in october   worldheart completed a to reverse stock split  as a result of which we held  common shares of worldheart 
in december  we sold  shares of worldheart for net proceeds of million  which was  as a result of our basis having been reduced to zero  recorded as a gain on the sale of worldheart common stock during the three months ended december  as of march   we held  common shares of worldheart  or approximately of worldheart s issued and outstanding shares

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues which includes revenues from products and funded research and development year ended march  revenues product funded research and development total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenue excluding amortization of intangibles research and development selling  general and administrative arbitration decision expensed in process research and development amortization of intangible assets total costs and expenses loss from operations other income and expense investment expense income  net gain on sale of worldheart stock change in fair value of worldheart note receivable and warrant other expense  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal revenue our revenues are comprised of the following year ended march  in s impella other total product revenues funded research and development total revenues product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in impella revenue of due to greater demand in the us following k clearance of the impella in june  offset by a decrease in our other non impella revenue 

table of contents impella revenues for fiscal increased by million  or to million from million for fiscal most of our impella revenue was from disposable product sales of impella  primarily as a result of sales occurring after our k clearance in june our launch strategy of impella has been focused on increasing demand for disposable products by providing consoles to initial sites at no cost 
we expect these console promotions to decrease as the number of hospitals using our impella products increase 
we have sold the impella to over hospitals in the us and our focus for fiscal will be concentrated on working with hospitals to assist them in adopting the impella on a regular basis  thus creating continued demand for the product 
other revenues for fiscal decreased by million or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in other revenue was due to a decrease in bvs and ab disposable revenue as well as a decrease in console revenue supporting these product lines 
we expect that bvs revenue will continue to decline as the product is years old 
we expect that our ab revenue will be rejuvenated somewhat with the approval of the portable driver in the us in march also  our recent k clearance for the impella in april will allow us an opportunity to sell ab as we refocus our efforts on the surgery market 
we expect that demand for our impella products should increase in fiscal and will comprise a higher percentage of total sales in the future based on k clearances of our impella  and ld products in the us and as we enroll more patients in our pci and ami pivotal studies for the impella clinical trial 
as a result  we expect that most of our revenue growth in fiscal will come from our impella product line  with limited or no growth for most of our other products 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues for fiscal increased by million or  to million from million for fiscal this was due to shipments of higher volumes of impella disposable products in fiscal this resulted in gross margin for fiscal of compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the effect of certain impella  ab  ipulse  and portable driver console programs implemented to generate future disposable revenue 
cost of product revenues also was negatively impacted during fiscal from materials  training and other expenses related to our capacity ramp up of impella 
during fiscal  we also wrote off approximately million of inventory for slow moving or obsolete products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was due to higher clinical trial activity for impella  offset by lower program spending on portable driver and abiocor 
research and development expenses for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our impella and us trials 
the increase in product development costs reflects our efforts to expand and enhance our product lines across a clinical spectrum of circulatory care 
we expect research and development spending to increase slightly in fiscal in order to support our efforts in enrolling patients in our pci and ami pivotal studies for the impella clinical trial 
we also will incur expenses to support improvement of our impella product line and continue to invest in research on new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase is due to an increase of million in stock based compensation primarily associated with grants of restricted stock made in may and august we have also made recent investments in marketing initiatives and in sales and clinical representatives with commercial headcount in the us up from at march  to at march  we are investing in our commercial organization to support the launch of the impella platform following k approval in the us we expect to continue to increase our expenditures on sales and marketing activities in fiscal  with particular investments in clinical personnel with cath lab expertise and we also plan to increase our marketing  service and training investments to support the efforts of the sales and field clinical teams to drive recovery awareness for acute heart failure patients 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets was million for each of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 

table of contents investment expense and income  net investment expense  net  was million for fiscal  representing a decrease of million from investment income of million for fiscal the decrease in investment income for the fiscal was due to realized and unrealized losses incurred on our investment in the columbia fund and a decrease in interest rates on short term marketable securities 
investment income and expense  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and investments and changes in the value of the columbia fund 
other expense income in december  we entered into an agreement in which we made a million investment in worldheart  a developer of an implantable mechanical circulatory support system for chronic heart failure patients 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal  reducing the carrying value of the investment to zero 
in july  the note receivable and warrant were converted into common stock of worldheart 
in december  we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which  as a result of our basis having been reduced to zero  resulted in a gain of million that was recorded during fiscal the changes in other expense are mainly due to foreign exchange effects 
provision for income taxes during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision is primarily due to a deferred tax liability related to a difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortizable over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
differences between amounts recorded as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet versus amounts recorded in the statements of operations are due to an unrealized gain from fluctuations in foreign currency with respect to our european operations 
the net deferred tax liability cannot be offset against our deferred tax assets since it relates to an indefinite lived asset and is not anticipated to reverse in the same period 
net loss during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to increased impella sales as a result of k clearance of the impella in the us in june we also incurred in fiscal a million charge relating to the change in value of the worldheart note receivable and warrant and a million charge relating to the arbitration award and warrant repurchase 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we plan to invest in expanding our global distribution to support revenue growth and as we invest in research and development and our impella pivotal studies to bring impella and other new products to market 
fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal revenues total revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal our revenues are primarily from sales of medical products for heart recovery 
product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal revenues from disposables  service and other products non console revenues comprised approximately and of total revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  revenues from impella disposables increased  ab disposables revenue increased and revenues from bvs declined approximately 
the impella disposables revenue increase was due to revenue recognized during our fiscal year from products used for the us pivotal studies for the impella device  as well as higher sales of the impella in europe 
we also recorded million in revenue during our fourth quarter of fiscal from sales of the abiocor total replacement heart 
comparing total revenues for fiscal to fiscal  total sales of our impella products consoles and disposables increased approximately  total sales of our ab products consoles and disposables decreased approximately  and total sales of our bvs products declined by approximately 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues for fiscal increased by million or  to million from million for fiscal this was due to an increase in cost of sales of disposable products as more of these products were sold in fiscal compared fiscal partially offset by lower cost of sales for consoles as console revenue declined in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  we recorded cost of product revenues for product shipped during fiscal in connection with the impella us pivotal studies and recently approved abiocor product 
there were no abiocor product sales in fiscal cost of product revenues also was unfavorably impacted during fiscal from materials  training and other expenses related to our strategic capacity ramp up of impella and ab console deployment programs 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million for a write off of inventory 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal research and development expenses for fiscal and included and million  respectively  in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our impella and us trials 
the increase in product development costs reflected our efforts to expand and enhance our product lines across a clinical spectrum of circulatory care  particularly related to increased clinical trial activity on impella selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase was due to increased investments in our global distribution of sales and clinical representatives with headcount up approximately as compared to fiscal  and is also due to our increased investments in our marketing initiatives 
arbitration decision in may  richard a 
nazarian  as selling stockholder representative  filed a demand for arbitration subsequently amended with the american arbitration association 
the claims arose out of our purchase of intellectual property rights relating to the penn state heart program and the related warrant agreements 
in november  we paid the warrant holders million of cash consideration to repurchase the warrants and in final settlement to release us of all potential claims by the warrant holders 
the excess of the million of cash consideration over the million estimated fair value of the warrants at october  was recorded as selling  general and administrative expense in the statements of operations during fiscal we expect that there will be no other future payments to warrant holders relating to this arbitration decision 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets was million for both fiscal and amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 
change in fair value of worldheart note receivable and warrant we marked to market the fair value of the conversion feature on the note receivable and warrant associated with the worldheart transaction through march  in may  worldheart filed a form k disclosing that it had limited cash available to continue operations and that if it was unable to secure additional funding  it would be forced to take extraordinary business measures which could include filing for bankruptcy  ceasing operations and liquidating assets 
due to these events  we recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal related to our note receivable from worldheart and its associated derivative instruments 
investment income  net investment income  net  was million for fiscal  representing an increase of million from million for fiscal due primarily to a higher cash and investments balance during fiscal compared to fiscal investment income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and investments less million in realized losses associated with our columbia fund for fiscal also included in investment income  net  is an unrealized loss on short term marketable securities of million incurred during fiscal due to a write down to fair value of securities we held in the columbia fund 
we deemed that the unrealized loss on the columbia fund was not temporary as the market value of the columbia fund was approximately of its carrying value 
other expense income the decrease in other income for fiscal was due to foreign exchange effects of million and miscellaneous income 
provision for income taxes during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in each year 
the income tax provision is primarily due to a deferred tax related to a difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortizable over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
differences between amounts recorded as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet versus amounts recorded in the statements of operations are due to an unrealized gain from fluctuations in foreign currency with respect to our european operations 
the net deferred tax liability cannot be offset against our deferred tax assets since it relates to an indefinite lived asset and is not anticipated to reverse in the same period 

table of contents net loss during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased selling  general and administrative expenses of million related to the expansion of our global distribution and an increase of million in research and development expenses for costs of our impella us pivotal studies 
included in the net loss for fiscal is a million charge relating to the change in value of the worldheart note receivable and warrant  million charge relating to the arbitration award and warrant repurchase and million for the unrealized loss on marketable securities 
liquidity and capital resources at march   our cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities totaled million  an increase of million compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities at march  in august  we completed a public offering in which we received net proceeds of million 
we believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources  including the cash received from our public offering  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
marketable securities at march  include million of marketable securities held in the columbia fund 
at march   other short term marketable securities consist of million held in funds that invest solely in us treasury securities 
in december  the columbia fund ceased accepting redemption requests from new or current investors and changed its method of valuing the securities in the columbia fund to market value rather than amortized cost 
as a result  we reclassified the securities in the columbia fund from cash equivalents to short term marketable securities as the columbia fund was no longer expected to have a maturity of less than days 
we deemed that the unrealized loss on the columbia fund was not temporary as the market value of the columbia fund was approximately of its carrying value at march  the columbia fund is being liquidated with distributions to us occurring from december through may since december  and through may   we have received disbursements of approximately million from the columbia fund with the most recent disbursement occurring on may  at approximately of its original value 
we have recorded million of the columbia fund as long term marketable securities at march  because bank of america  the sponsor of the columbia fund  has indicated that it cannot predict with certainty whether or not the columbia fund will redeem this amount within the next year 
the recent and unprecedented disruption in the credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial and other institutions 
our investments in the columbia fund have been frozen since december and we are subject to redemptions of these investments based on the discretion of the fund 
when redemptions have occurred  we have realized losses on our original investment and we expect to incur losses on future redemptions 
since december  we have incurred million in realized losses and million in unrealized losses on the columbia fund through march  we are not a party to any interest rate swaps  currency hedges or derivative contracts of any type and have no exposure to commercial paper or auction rate securities markets 
we continue to monitor our cash position closely with recent economic events and currently only invest excess cash in short term us treasury securities 
financial instruments  such as the columbia fund for which the fair value is derived primarily from broker quotes or pricing services may fall within level  or of the sfas fair value hierarchy  depending on the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value 
we review the pricing assumptions  inputs and methodologies in determining an instrument s fair value as a basis for classification within the sfas fair value hierarchy 
if we believe that these estimates of fair value differ significantly from our internal expectations  we review our findings with respect to data sources or assumptions used to determine whether the value is appropriate 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the overall health of the credit markets 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any further disruption in the credit environment 
our primary liquidity needs are to fund the expansion of our impella manufacturing capacity in germany and ireland  to fund new product development  and general working capital needs 
through march   we have funded our operations principally from product revenue and through the sale of equity securities  including our august stock offering in which we received proceeds of million 
we also generate funds from product and funded research and development revenue 
our operating activities during the year ended march  used cash of million as compared to million during the same period in the prior year 
our net loss for the year ended march  of million was the primary cause of our cash use from operations 
increases in accounts receivable used cash of million during fiscal due to increased sales activity  primarily related to impella 
in addition  the increases in inventories used cash of million during the year ended march   reflecting our inventory build up to support anticipated increases in global demand for our products  particularly impella additionally  we recorded million in write downs of inventory for excess and obsolescence during fiscal these decreases in cash were partially offset by non cash adjustments of million related to stock based compensation expense and million of depreciation and amortization 
our investing activities during the year ended march  used cash of million as compared to million during the same period in the prior year 
cash used by investment activities for the year ended march  consisted primarily of million of

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  was primarily comprised of million in net proceeds related to our august public offering and million attributable to the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
capital expenditures for fiscal are estimated to be to million  which relate primarily to our planned manufacturing capacity increases for impella in germany  our expansion in ireland  and software development projects 
our liquidity is influenced by our ability to sell our products in a competitive industry and our customers ability to pay for our products 
factors that may affect liquidity include our ability to penetrate the market for our products  maintain or reduce the length of the selling cycle  and collect cash from clients after our products are sold 
exclusive of activities involving any future acquisitions of products or companies that complement or augment our existing line of products  we believe that current available funds and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures  working capital  and other cash requirements at least through the next months 
we continue to review our long term cash needs on a regular basis 
currently  we have no debt outstanding 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

we apply the disclosure provisions of fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  and interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 or fin no 
to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
these disclosure provisions expand those required by sfas no 
by requiring that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance is remote 
the following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor 
we enter into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business  typically with underwriters  contractors  clinical sites and customers that include indemnification provisions 
under these provisions we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements at march  clinical study agreements in our clinical study agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the participating institutions against losses incurred by them for claims related to any personal injury of subjects taking part in the study to the extent they relate to use of our devices in accordance with the clinical study agreement  the protocol for the device and our instructions 
the indemnification provisions contained within our clinical study agreements do not generally include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs related to the indemnification provisions contained in our clinical study agreements 
product warranties we accrue for estimated future warranty costs on our product sales at the time of shipment 
all of our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates 
our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision 
patent indemnifications in many sales transactions  we indemnify customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by our products 
the indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales transactions 
under the provisions of fin no 
 intellectual property indemnifications require disclosure only 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk primary market risk exposures our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial 
short term and long term marketable securities at march  consist of million in the columbia fund and million in five funds that invest in us treasury securities and related interest 
in december  the columbia fund ceased accepting redemption requests from new or current investors and changed its method of valuing the securities in the columbia fund to market value rather than amortized cost 
as a result  we reclassified the securities in the columbia fund from cash equivalents to short term marketable securities as the columbia fund was no longer expected to have a maturity of less than days 
we deemed that the unrealized loss on the columbia fund was not temporary as the market value of the columbia fund was approximately of its carrying value at december  and the company did not expect to recover the value in liquidation 
the columbia fund is being liquidated with distributions to us occurring during fiscal and since december  and through may   we have received disbursements of approximately million 
table of contents from the columbia fund with the most recent disbursement occurring on may  at approximately of its original value 
we have recorded million of the columbia fund as long term marketable securities at march  because bank of america  the sponsor of the columbia fund  has indicated that it cannot predict with certainty whether or not the columbia fund will redeem this amount within the next year 
while it is our intent to liquidate securities in the columbia fund in future periods to reduce our exposure to future deterioration of these securities  we believe that our operating results and cash flows could be affected significantly by market value adjustments to the columbia fund 
there can be no assurance that we will not have to take additional losses on the columbia fund 
in july  worldheart completed the transactions contemplated by the recapitalization agreement dated june   as amended on july   among us  worldheart  world heart  inc  venrock partners v  lp  venrock associates v  lp  venrock entrepreneurs fund v  lp  special situations fund iii qp lp  special situations cayman fund  lp  special situations private equity fund  lp  special situations life sciences fund  lp  austin marxe and new leaf ventures ii  lp as a result of the transaction  we received million common shares of worldheart  which represented approximately of worldheart s issued and outstanding common shares following the transaction 
the shares were received as a result of our conversion of the full amount of principal and interest owed on the million convertible secured note issued in december  our release of the security interest in all of the assets of worldheart that secured the note  termination of the warrant we held to purchase million common shares of worldheart issued in december  and forgiveness of other amounts owed to us by worldheart

in december  we sold  shares of worldheart for net proceeds of million 
as a result  as of march   we now hold  common shares of worldheart  or approximately of worldheart s issued and outstanding shares 
we are accounting for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
the carrying value of this investment was zero at march  currency exchange rates our foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the euro 
therefore  our investment in our subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
had a depreciation in the euro occurred relative to the us dollar as of march   the result would have been a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the estimated fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
considerable judgment is required  however  to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts
