item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are the leading  and only international  company providing a make your own stuffed animal interactive entertainment experience under the build a bear workshop brand  in which our guests stuff  fluff  dress  accessorize and name their own teddy bears and other stuffed animals 
our concept  which we developed for mall based retailing  capitalizes on what we believe is the relatively untapped demand for experience based shopping as well as the widespread appeal of stuffed animals 
the build a bear workshop experience appeals to a broad range of age groups and demographics  including children  teens  their parents and grandparents 
as of january   we operated stores in the united states and canada  stores in the united kingdom  one store in ireland and three stores in france  and had franchised stores operating in international locations under the build a bear workshop brand 
in addition to our stores  we sell our products on our e commerce web site  www 
buildabear 
com and market our products and build our brand through our virtual world website  buildabearville 
com  which complements our interactive shopping experience and positively enhances our core brand value 
we also operate non traditional store locations in major league baseball ballparks  one location in a zoo and one location in a science center 
on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of the bear factory limited  a stuffed animal retailer in the united kingdom  and amsbra limited  our former uk franchisee 
the results of this acquisition s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
in conjunction with those transactions  we obtained retail locations in the united kingdom and ireland 
four of those locations closed during of those four locations  two closed due to overlapping store locations in the amsbra and bear factory portfolios  and the other two locations were concessions within department stores  which is a format that we chose not to continue in the united kingdom 
we converted and rebranded bear factory stores to build a bear workshop stores in time for the holiday season  resulting in a unified company brand throughout the uk and ireland 
during the store conversion and rebranding process  stores were temporarily closed on average for days while many of the costs to operate the stores continue 
during  we improved sales performance and adopted internal best practices in the areas of merchandising  marketing  purchasing and store operations  across the acquired store base  resulting in improved sales and earnings from the acquisition 
also in  we terminated our french franchise agreement and opened our first company owned stores in france 
we operate in three segments that share the same infrastructure  including management  systems  merchandising and marketing  and generate revenues as follows company owned retail stores located in the united states  canada  puerto rico  the united kingdom  ireland  and france  a webstore and seasonal  event based locations  international stores operated under franchise agreements  and license arrangements with third parties which manufacture and sell to other retailers merchandise carrying the build a bear workshop brand 
selected financial data attributable to each segment for fiscal  and  are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for a discussion of the key trends and uncertainties that have affected our revenues  income and liquidity  see the revenues  costs and expenses and expansion and growth potential subsections of this overview 
we believe that we have developed an appealing retail store concept that  for stores open for the entire year  averaged million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in net retail sales per store  for stores open for the entire year  not including our european stores 
for a discussion of the changes in comparable store sales in fiscal years  and  see revenues 
store contribution  which consists of income before income tax expense  interest  store depreciation and amortization  store preopening expense  store closing expense and general and administrative expense  excluding franchise fees  income from licensing activities and contribution from our webstore and seasonal event based locations  as a percentage of net retail sales  excluding revenue from our webstore and seasonal and event based locations  was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal total company net income as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal  for fiscal and 
table of contents for fiscal see non gaap financial measures for a reconciliation of store contribution to net income 
the store contribution of our average store  coupled with the fact that we have opened or acquired company owned stores in the united states  canada  puerto rico  the united kingdom  ireland and france since the beginning of fiscal had been the primary reasons for our net income increasing over the period from fiscal through fiscal net income declined in and due primarily to the decrease in comparable store sales 
as we have added stores and grown our sales volume  the quantities of merchandise and supplies we purchase have increased which has created economies of scale for our vendors allowing us to obtain reduced costs for these items and increase our merchandise margin 
in and  merchandise margin improvement was more than offset by fixed occupancy cost deleverage due primarily to the decrease in comparable store sales 
in our results reflect the challenging retail environment economic recession  declining mall traffic  and slowing consumer spending factors impacting many retailers and particularly our company given the discretionary nature of our products and our experience 
our total store contribution declined  primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales  this decrease in total store contribution was partially offset by improved store contribution from our european operations and increased contribution from our franchising and licensing operations 
our plan balances our long term business goals while recognizing the near term challenges of the retail environment 
while our full market potential in north america remains more than stores  we will slow new store growth in to new store  down from stores in slowing new store growth allows us to refocus on our business and align all operations around our goals of new guest acquisition and guest retention aimed at improving our comparable stores sales performance  while also building our long term brand value with the addition of our virtual world  buildabearville 
com 
our brand strategy is to be wherever families and children go to have fun and our investment in buildabearville 
com recognizes the emerging trend of kids interaction and play in the online space 
we believe we are strongly positioned to lead in this space with over million stuffed animals sold and over million households in our database 
in addition to leveraging buildabearville 
com to bring traffic to our stores  our ongoing marketing and merchandise plans balance initiatives to attract new guests and retain existing guests 
we will enhance communications to our loyalty program members who today include over four million active guests  and place emphasis on our product newness and collectability  a fundamental strength of our brand 
additionally  we have implemented cost reduction initiatives expected to result in approximately million in annualized pre tax savings 
we ended fiscal debt free and with million in cash and cash equivalents after investing million in new stores and other capital projects 
while our near term sales trends reflect the continuing decline in consumer spending  we believe that our business plan  superior store contribution model  strong cash flow and flexible capital structure will deliver long term sales and earnings growth 
following is a description and discussion of the major components of our statement of operations revenues net retail sales net retail sales are revenues from retail sales including our webstore and other non mall locations  are net of discounts  exclude sales tax  include shipping and handling costs billed to customers  and are recognized at the time of sale 
revenues from gift cards are recognized at the time of redemption 
our guests use cash  checks and third party credit cards to make purchases 
we classify stores as new or comparable stores and do not include our webstore or seasonal  event based locations in our store count or in our comparable store calculations 
stores enter the comparable store calculation in their thirteenth full month of operation and as such  european stores were not included for as of january   we operated nine friends b made locations 
all but one of these locations are inside or adjacent to a build a bear workshop store and share common store management  employees and infrastructure 
other than our stand alone store in ontario  california  these locations are considered expansions of the existing build a bear workshop store and are not considered an addition to our total store count 
the net retail sales of these expanded build a bear workshop stores are excluded from comparable store sales calculations until the thirteenth full month of operation after the date of the expansion 
we have an automated frequent shopper program in the united states  the stuff fur stuff club  whereby guests enroll in the program and receive one point for every dollar or partial dollar spent and after reaching points receive a discount on a future purchase 
this program was automated in july and replaced our former buy stuff club program  which was a manual punch card system with limited tracking capability 
the reward earned under the new program did not change 
an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on historical redemption rates  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales at the time of purchase 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales  in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the discount 
we account for changes in the deferred revenue account at the total company level only 
this is due to the fact that the frequent buyer discount can be earned or redeemed at any of our store locations 
therefore  when we refer to net retail sales by location  such as comparable stores or new stores  these amounts do not include any changes in the deferred revenue amount 
see critical accounting estimates for additional details on the accounting for the deferred revenue program

fiscal first quarter was the first quarter that our european operations met the criteria for inclusion in our comparable store calculation 
as such  there is no comparable data for europe for fiscal or excludes our webstore and seasonal and event based locations 
prior to  as a group our younger stores have performed at the highest sales per square foot level  above the chain wide average 
often our stores open with strong sales performance in their first year of operation and show comparable store sales declines in years two and three  new stores typically pay for themselves between their first and second year of operation 
our older stores consistently perform the best on a comparable store sales basis

in fiscal consolidated comparable store sales decrease of 
fiscal was the first year that our european operations met the criteria for inclusion in our comparable store calculation 
the growth in comparable store sales in europe largely reflects increases in brand awareness and improvements in merchandise  store operations  guest satisfaction and inventory flow since we completed the uk acquisition in we believe the decline in consolidated comparable store sales was attributed primarily to the following factors the economic recession and dramatic decrease in consumer wealth has resulted in a significant decline in consumer sentiment resulting in a pullback in consumer spending  the decline in shopping mall customer traffic during fiscal compared to fiscal has impacted the number of new and returning guests visiting our stores  and changes in media  online entertainment  children s media consumption  and play patterns  particularly for girls  have increased the interactive play alternatives available to children 
comparable store sales decreased by in fiscal following a decrease of in fiscal we believe these changes can be attributed primarily to the following factors a decline in shopping mall customer traffic and consumer discretionary spending  changes in media  online entertainment  children s media consumption  and play patterns  particularly for girls  and lower than expected customer purchases of select licensed movie products introduced in the fiscal second quarter 

table of contents franchise fees we receive an initial  one time franchise fee for each master franchise agreement which is amortized to revenue over the life of the respective franchise agreement  which extend for periods up to years 
master franchise rights are typically granted to a franchisee for an entire country or countries 
continuing franchise fees are based on a percentage of sales generally made by the franchisees stores and are recognized as revenue at the time of those sales 
as of january   we had stores  including opened and seven closed in fiscal  operating under franchise arrangements in the following countries japan south africa denmark australia thailand singapore germany russia norway benelux other benelux includes belgium  the netherlands and luxembourg 
on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of amsbra limited  our former uk franchisee 
amsbra operated all of the franchised build a bear workshop stores located in the united kingdom 
upon completion of the acquisition  all of the franchised locations in the united kingdom became company owned stores 
licensing revenue licensing revenue is based on a percentage of sales made by licensees to third parties and is recognized at the time the product is shipped by the licensee or at the point of sale 
we have entered into a number of licensing arrangements whereby third parties manufacture and sell to other retailers merchandise carrying the build a bear workshop trademark

these expenses also include depreciation and amortization of central office leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment as well as the amortization of intellectual property costs 
central office general and administrative expenses have grown over time in order to support the increased number of stores in operation and we believe will continue to grow as we add stores  but we expect this increase to be at a lower rate than the percentage increase in total revenues 
advertising increased significantly with the introduction in fiscal of our national television and online advertising campaign 
we decreased the level of advertising expense as a percentage of net retail sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal and maintained the level of expense as compared to fiscal we anticipate continuing our investment of to of total revenues in advertising programs during other store expenses such as credit card fees and supplies historically have increased or decreased proportionately with net retail sales

store contribution should not be considered a substitute for net income  net income per store  cash flows provided by operating activities  cash flows provided by operating activities per store  or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe store contribution is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it  along with the number of stores in operation  directly impacts our profitability

our operating results for one period may not be indicative of results for other periods  and may fluctuate significantly because of a variety of factors  including those discussed under risk factors risks related to owning our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations could cause the price of our common stock to substantially decline 
the timing of new store openings may result in fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of the revenues and expenses associated with each new store location 
we typically incur most preopening costs for a new store in the three months immediately preceding the store s opening 
we expect our growth  operating results and profitability to depend in some degree on our ability to increase our number of stores 
for accounting purposes  the quarters of each fiscal year consist of weeks  although we will have a week quarter approximately once every six years 
the fiscal fourth quarter was a week quarter 
quarterly fluctuations and seasonality may cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to fall 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for the opening of new stores  information systems and working capital 
historically  we have met these requirements through capital generated from the sale and issuance of our securities to private investors and through our initial public offering  cash flow provided by operations and our revolving line of credit

most of our retail stores are located within shopping malls and all are operated under leases classified as operating leases 
our leases in north america typically have a ten year term and contain provisions for base rent plus percentage rent based on defined sales levels 
many of the leases contain a provision whereby either we or the landlord may terminate the lease after a certain time  typically in the third to fourth year of the lease  if a certain minimum sales volume is not achieved 
in addition  some of these leases contain various restrictions relating to change of control of our company 
our leases also subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters  including rights of termination in some cases 
our leases in the uk and ireland typically have terms of to years and generally contain a provision whereby every fifth year the rental rate can be adjusted to reflect the current market rates 
the leases typically provide the lessee with the first right for renewal at the end of the lease 
we may also be required to make deposits and rent guarantees to secure new leases as we expand

french leases for premier retail properties frequently have entry fees and or key money payments required to be made in conjunction with signature of the leases 
such entry fees or key money payments may be recovered  in whole or in part  upon disposal of the leases 
the leases typically provide the lessee with the first right for renewal at the end of the lease 
rent deposits consisting of three months rent are also required to be paid on execution of the leases 
rents are negotiated on a fixed basis  but are reviewed annually in relation to an inflation index and therefore also have a variable rent component 
rents are charged quarterly and paid in advance

capital spending in fiscal was primarily for the opening of new stores in north america and in europe  and the continued installation and upgrades of central office information technology systems 
in fiscal  the average investment per new store  which includes leasehold improvements  fixtures  equipment and inventory  was approximately million 
we anticipate the investment per store in fiscal will be approximately the same as fiscal on february   we announced a million share repurchase program of our outstanding common stock over the following twelve months 
the program was authorized by our board of directors 
on march   we announced an expansion of our share repurchase program to million for an additional twelve months

we currently intend to purchase up to million of our common stock in the in the open market including through b plans  through privately negotiated transactions or through an accelerated repurchase transaction 
the primary source of funding for the program is expected to be cash on hand 
the timing and amount of share repurchases  if any  will depend on price  market conditions  applicable regulatory requirements  and other factors 
the program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 
shares repurchased under the program will be subsequently retired 
as of march   approximately  shares at an average price of per share have been repurchased under this program for an aggregate amount of million 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash flow requirements for at least the next months 
our credit agreement expires on december  off balance sheet arrangements we hold a minority interest in ridemakerz  llc  which is accounted for under the equity method 
we purchased a call option from a group of other ridemakerz investors for  for million ridemakerz common units at an exercise price of per unit 
the call option was immediately exercisable and expires april  simultaneously  we granted a put option to the same group of investors for million common units at an exercise price of per unit 
the put option was exercisable on april  and expires on april  as of january   the investment in ridemakerz was approximately million  which represented an ownership interest of approximately 
under the current agreements  we could own up to approximately of fully diluted equity in ridemakerz

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and commercial commitments include future minimum obligations under operating leases and purchase obligations 
our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise inventory and obligations associated with building out our stores 
the future minimum payments for these obligations as of january  for periods subsequent to this date are as follows payments due by fiscal period as of january  total beyond in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our total liability for uncertain tax positions under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin was million as of january  during the next fiscal year  it is reasonably possible to reduce unrecognized tax benefits by million either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or expiration of statute of limitations 
at this time  we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next year 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have identified the following critical accounting estimates inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on an average cost basis 
historically  we have not conducted sales whereby we offer products below cost 
throughout the year we record an estimated cost of shortage based on past experience 
the amount accrued for shortage each period is based on detailed historical averages 
the accrual rate remained unchanged for fiscal  and periodic physical inventories are taken and any difference between the actual physical count of merchandise and the recorded amount in our records are adjusted and recorded as shortage 
historically  including fiscal years  and  the timing of the physical inventory has been in the fourth quarter so that no material amount of shortage was required to be estimated on activity between the date of the physical count and year end 
however  future physical counts of merchandise may not be at times at or near the end of a fiscal quarter or fiscal year end  and our estimate of shortage for the intervening period may be material based on the amount of time between the date of the physical inventory and the date of the fiscal quarter or year end 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset  or asset group  to expected future net cash flows generated by the asset  or asset group 
if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated 
table of contents undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount is compared to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized to the extent of the difference 
for purposes of evaluating store assets for impairment  we have determined that each store location is an asset group 
as of january   store assets represented approximately million  or approximately of total property  plant and equipment  net 
factors that we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant changes in our business strategies and or negative industry or economic trends 
we assess events and changes in circumstances or strategy that could potentially indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable as they occur 
due to the seasonality of operations  we assess store performance annually  using the full year s results 
we consider a historical and or projected negative cash flow trend for a store location to be an indicator that the carrying value of that asset group may not be recoverable 
as a result of our review  we determined that several stores would not be able to recover the carrying value of certain store leasehold improvements through expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to fair value  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset group  and recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is included in cost of merchandise sold 
in the event that we decide to close any or all of these stores in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment  lease termination charges  severance charges and other charges 
no store assets were impaired in fiscal or impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends  and thus could be significantly different than historical results 
as we continue to face a challenging retail environment and general uncertainty in the global economy  the assumptions used in future calculations of fair value may change significantly which could result in further impairment charges in future periods 
in the fiscal third quarter  we announced plans to close its friends b made concept 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million  related to the closures 
in addition  we expect to incur pre tax charges of approximately to million through the third quarter of fiscal the majority of these charges are attributable to potential lease termination costs and other potential costs associated with the closure plan 
corporate assets  including computer hardware and software and the company owned distribution center approximately million as of january   and intangible assets  such as trademarks and intellectual property  net  approximately million as of january   have a broad applicability and generally considered to be recoverable  unless abandoned 
other long lived assets are comprised of deferred franchise and lease costs  including key money deposits  approximately million as of january   that are monitored in relation to the specific franchisee and store location  respectively 
none of these corporate long lived assets were impaired in fiscal  or goodwill and other intangibles we record goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
all of our recorded goodwill  which is associated with our uk acquisition  is recorded in the european reporting unit 
at january  and december   our goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
goodwill is subject to periodic evaluation for impairment when circumstances warrant  or at least once per year 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment is tested in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  by comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
as there are not quoted prices for our reporting unit  fair value is estimated based upon a present value technique using estimated discounted future cash flows  forecasted over the reasonably assured lease terms for retail stores  with growth rates forecasted for the reporting unit and using a credit adjusted discount rate 
we use current results  trends  future prospects  and other economic factors as the basis for expected future cash flows 
assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we make every effort to forecast these future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed 
however  changes in the assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of goodwill  and could result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
factors that have the potential to create variances between forecasted cash flows and actual results include but are not limited to i fluctuations in sales volumes  ii long term growth in the number of stores  and iii distribution costs  including fuel  and other product costs 
refer to forward looking statements included in the beginning of this form k for further information regarding the impact of estimates of future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the financial performance of the reporting unit  future growth rate  and discount rate 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease in cash flows  and made changes to our projected growth rate and discount rate which we believe are considered appropriate 
based on the goodwill analysis performed as of january   the outlined changes in our assumptions would not affect the results of the impairment test  as the reporting unit still had an excess of fair value over the carrying value 
however  as we continue to face a challenging retail environment and general uncertainty in the global economy  the assumptions used in future calculations of fair value may change significantly which could result in impairment charges in future periods 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues from retail sales  net of discounts and excluding sales tax  are recognized at the time of sale 
guest returns have not been significant 
revenues from gift certificates are recognized at the time of redemption 
unredeemed gift cards are included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have an automated frequent shopper program in the united states  the stuff fur stuff club  whereby guests enroll in the program and receive one point for every dollar or partial dollar spent and after reaching points receive a discount on a future purchase 
this program replaced the former buy stuff club 
an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on historical redemption rates  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales at the time of purchase 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales  in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the discount 
we track redemptions of these various cards and use actual redemption rates by card series and historical results to estimate how much revenue to defer 
we review these redemption rates and assess the adequacy of the deferred revenue account at the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to the estimates involved in these assessments  adjustments to the deferral rate are generally made no more often than semi annually in order to allow time for more definite trends to emerge 
based upon an assessment at the end of fiscal  the deferred revenue account was adjusted downward by million  effective at the beginning of fiscal  with a corresponding increase to net retail sales  and a million increase in net income 
additionally  the amount of revenue being deferred for future periods has been decreased by bps to give effect to the change in redemption experience and the increased visibility of the redemptions with the automated system 
in  we reduced the estimated liability associated with the former buy stuff cards by million 
redemptions of buy stuff cards were no longer allowed after august  existing points earned on buy stuff cards can be transferred to the new stuff fur stuff club program 
based on the assessment at the end of fiscal  no adjustment was made to the deferral rate 
based on the most recent assessment at the end of fiscal  the deferred revenue account was adjusted downward by million  effective at the beginning of fiscal  with a corresponding increase to net retail sales  and a million increase in net income 
additionally  the amount of revenue being deferred for future periods has been decreased by bps to give effect to the change in redemption experience and the increased visibility of the redemptions with the automated system 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement  which deferred the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
in accordance with this interpretation  we adopted the provisions of sfas on december  with respect to our financial assets and financial liabilities 
the provisions of sfas have not been applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
the major categories of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value  for which we will wait until to apply the provisions of sfas  are as follows reporting units measured at fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test under sfas and long lived assets measured at fair value for an impairment assessment under sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas no 
r 
this statement requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires additional disclosures by the acquirer 
under this statement  all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
this statement became effective for us on january  and will be applied to business combinations occurring after the effective date 
earlier application was prohibited 
the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our financial statements will be on adjustments made to pre acquisition income tax contingencies  which will no longer be reflected as an adjustment to goodwill but recognized through income tax expense beginning in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our results of operations and our cash flows can be impacted by changes in interest rates 
outstanding balances under our credit facility bear interest at our option of prime minus or libor plus 
we had no borrowings outstanding during fiscal accordingly  a basis point change in interest rates would result in no material change to our annual interest expense 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we conduct operations in various countries  which expose us to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries and franchisees may be materially impacted by exposure to fluctuating exchange rates 
reported sales  costs and expenses at our foreign subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement 
while exchange rate fluctuations can have a material impact on reported revenues  costs and expenses  and earnings  this impact is principally the result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows 
although we do enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the us  these obligations are settled primarily in us dollars and  therefore  we believe we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks for our purchase obligations 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes
