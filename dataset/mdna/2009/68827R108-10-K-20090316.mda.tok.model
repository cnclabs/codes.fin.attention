you should read this discussion together with our financial statements and notes included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
highlights we believe cellular therapies have certain advantages over traditional medical approaches 
for example  cell therapies can be targeted  avoiding many of the safety complications arising from systemic treatments 
cell therapies can also be responsive to their environment  turning on or off certain effects as conditions in the surrounding tissue change 
cell therapies can also be multifaceted 
for example  the cells in prochymal  our leading biologic drug candidate  have demonstrated the ability to not only down regulate inflammation  but also repair the damage caused by the inflammation 
we believe the combination of these unique properties will allow us to solve many of the more challenging questions facing medicine today 
we have established ourselves as the leader in the emerging field of cell therapy 
we are an industry leader in the field  having developed the only commercially available stem cell product on the market 
we are continuing to make advances  with eight active clinical trials 
four of the trials have progressed to phase iii  each of which has been granted fast track status by the fda 
during  we formed major strategic alliance with genzyme corporation pursuant to a collaboration agreement worth up to billion  for the development and commercialization of prochymal and chondrogen in countries outside the united states and canada  utilized the first million of the non contingent  non refundable up front payment received under our collaboration agreement with genzyme to extinguish all of our outstanding debt and now report cash  short term investments and receivables of million as of december  we are scheduled to receive an additional million non contingent payment under this agreement on july   sold our osteocel business in a transaction worth up to million 
to date  we have earned and received the million of initial purchase price and the first million milestone under this transaction  awarded a contract by the united states department of defense to develop and stockpile prochymal for acute radiation syndrome ars  fully valued at up to million  
table of contents completed enrollment in first worldwide phase iii stem cell clinical trial for the treatment of steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease gvhd  reached agreement with the fda regarding the timing and content of the submission of the first marketing application for a stem cell drug  received approval to treat pediatric patients suffering from gvhd with prochymal under the fda s expanded access program  received fda clearance to broaden prochymal expanded access program to adults with gvhd  received approval to initiate prochymal expanded access program in canada for pediatric patients suffering from life threatening gvhd  completed enrollment of phase ii clinical trial evaluating prochymal in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  and reported positive two year data from the phase i clinical trial evaluating prochymal in heart attack patients 
business overview we are a leading stem cell therapeutic company focused on developing and marketing products to treat medical conditions in the inflammatory  orthopedic and cardiovascular areas 
our biologic drug candidates utilize mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs 
we launched the only commercially available stem cell product in we currently have eight clinical trials ongoing  including four phase iii clinical trials 
we are conducting phase iii trials for prochymal  our lead biologic drug candidate  for the treatment of steroid refractory acute gvhd  first line treatment of acute gvhd  biologics refractory crohn s disease  and acute radiation syndrome  which is under the animal rule 
we have received fast track status from the fda for each of these pivotal phase iii trials for prochymal 
we have initiated phase ii clinical trials for prochymal for both type diabetes and acute myocardial infarction 
we are a fully integrated company  having developed capabilities in research  development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of stem cell products 
we have developed an extensive intellectual property portfolio to protect our technology in the united states and a number of foreign countries  including us and foreign patents owned or licensed 
we believe that our biologic drug candidates have advantages over other stem cell therapeutics in development for at least the following reasons stem cell source 
our stem cells are obtained from adult bone marrow  a readily available source 
the cells are drawn from the hips of volunteer donors between the ages of and years  using a simple needle and syringe aspiration 
because the cells are obtained from consenting adult donors  we are able to largely avoid the ethical controversy surrounding embryonic and fetal stem cell research 
ability to mass produce 
through our proprietary manufacturing methods  we can grow mesenchymal stem cells msc in a controlled fashion to produce up to  treatments of our biologic drug candidates from a single bone marrow donation 
our ability to produce a large quantity of treatments from one donation provides us with manufacturing efficiencies and product consistency that are essential to commercialization 
universal compatibility 
many stem cell therapies under development can elicit a rejection response in the recipient and therefore require donor to recipient matching or potentially harmful immunosuppression 
this greatly reduces manufacturing efficiencies and creates a risk of mismatch which can result in an acute inflammatory response and  potentially  in death 

table of contents based on our clinical experience  we believe that our biologic drug candidates are not rejected by the patient s immune system and so  like type o negative blood  do not require donor to recipient matching 
this universal compatibility allows us to produce a standardized product available to all patients in almost any medical setting 
treatment on demand 
our biologic drug candidates can be stored frozen at end user medical facilities until they are needed 
we anticipate that medical facilities will be able to prescribe and dispense these products in much the same way as conventional drugs 
in contrast  other stem cell technologies under development require weeks to prepare after a patient s need is identified 
this is a key feature of our technology  as many patients in the critical care setting require prompt treatment 
on october   we entered into a collaboration agreement with genzyme corporation for the global development and commercialization of prochymal and chondrogen 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  we retain the right to commercialize prochymal and chondrogen in the united states and canada and genzyme is granted the exclusive right and license to commercialize the products in all other countries except with respect to gvhd in japan where prochymal has previously been licensed to another pharmaceutical company 
in july  we separately partnered with genzyme for the development of effective countermeasures to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
in january  we were awarded a contract from the us department of defense  pursuant to which we  in partnership with genzyme  are seeking to develop and stockpile prochymal for the repair of gastrointestinal injury resulting from acute radiation exposure 
additionally  we have partnered with the jdrf for the development of prochymal as a treatment for the preservation of insulin production in patients with newly diagnosed type diabetes mellitus 
in april  we committed to a plan to sell our assets related to osteocel  a product that we have produced and marketed since july  for regenerating bone in orthopedic indications 
on may   we entered into an agreement to sell our entire osteocel and osteocel xo product line to nuvasive  inc the agreement provides for the sale to be effected at two closings a technology assets closing  at which technology and certain other business assets are transferred  and a manufacturing assets closing  at which manufacturing assets and facilities are transferred 
the technology assets closing  occurred on july   at which time we received an initial payment of million and entered into a manufacturing agreement under which we will continue to manufacture osteocel for up to eighteen months after the technology assets closing  and sell of the product to nuvasive at specified prices 
nuvasive has certain minimum purchase order obligations under the manufacturing agreement 
the asset purchase agreement provides that the manufacturing assets closing is to occur eighteen months after the technology assets closing  or upon earlier termination of the manufacturing agreement 
as a result of these transactions  all of the activities related to our osteocel product line have been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
financial operations overview revenue in  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genzyme for the development and commercialization of prochymal and chondrogen that provides for non contingent  non refundable up front payments of million and contingent milestone payments 
this collaboration agreement has multiple deliverables  and consistent with our accounting policy for such transactions  we are amortizing these amounts into revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated completion period of the deliverables  which extend through the first quarter of we recognized million of revenue in related to this agreement 
contingent milestone payments earned and for which we have no 
table of contents continuing performance obligations  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of the related milestone  while milestone payments for which we have a continuing performance obligation will be deferred when received and amortized to revenue over the term of the related performance obligations 
in  we partnered with genzyme to develop prochymal as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
in the first quarter of  we were awarded a contract from the united states department of defense dod pursuant to which we  in partnership with genzyme  are seeking to develop and stockpile prochymal for the repair of gastrointestinal injury resulting from acute radiation exposure 
under the terms of the contract  the dod will provide funding to us  and if we are successful in obtaining fda approval for acute radiation syndrome  the contract provides for the additional purchase of up to  doses of prochymal  at  per dose 
we recognized million in revenue under the terms of this contract in in prior years  we have entered into strategic agreements with other companies for the development and commercialization of select stem cell biologic drug candidates for specific indications and geographic markets 
in  we entered into a collaborative agreement with the juvenile diabetes research foundation jdrf to conduct a phase ii clinical trial evaluating prochymal as a treatment for type diabetes mellitus 
this collaborative agreement provides for jdrf to provide up to million of contingent milestone funding to support the development of prochymal for the preservation of insulin production in patients with newly diagnosed type diabetes mellitus 
the contingent milestone payments under the agreement are amortized into revenue on a straight line basis over the duration of our obligations under the collaborative agreement as they are earned 
we received million in milestone payments from jdrf in and recognized million in revenue during under this agreement 
in  we entered into an agreement with a foreign pharmaceutical company granting it exclusive rights to prochymal for the treatment of gvhd in japan 
we recognized million of revenue during related to this agreement 
also in we entered into an agreement with a major pharmaceutical company relating to the development of our cardiac biologic drug candidate  and we received a million fee for licensing the use of our technology 
this agreement was terminated in and as a result we regained the worldwide rights to prochymal for cardiac indications 
we recognized million in license fee revenue in and million in related to this agreement 
research and development costs our research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing biologic drug candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs of contract research and manufacturing  costs of facilities  and the costs of manufacturing clinical batches of biologic drug candidates  quality control supplies and material to expand biologic drug candidates 
consistent with our focus on the development of biologic drug candidates with potential uses in multiple indications  many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified product 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects 
accordingly  we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
from inception through december   we incurred aggregate research and development costs of approximately million 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in the future  as we expand our clinical trial activity for our existing biologic drug candidates as they advance through the development cycle and as we invest in additional product opportunities and research programs 
clinical 
table of contents trials and preclinical studies are time consuming and expensive 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to many uncertainties 
we test our products in several preclinical studies  and we then conduct clinical trials for those biologic drug candidates that we determine to be the most promising 
as we obtain results from clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay trials for some biologic drug candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising biologic drug candidates 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  size of trial and intended use of a biologic drug candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the number of sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the duration of patient treatment and follow up  the costs of producing supplies of the biologic drug candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the efficacy and safety profile of the biologic drug candidate  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
as a result of these uncertainties  we are unable to determine with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our biologic drug candidates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with our general management  including salaries  allocations of facilities and related costs  and professional fees such as legal and accounting expenses 
we have increased our general and administrative expense for legal and accounting compliance costs  investor relations and other activities associated with operating as a publicly traded company and strengthened our administrative capabilities as we approach the commercial launch of prochymal 
continued increases will also likely result from the hiring of additional operational  financial  accounting  facilities engineering and information systems personnel 
interest expense  net interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and investments available for sale 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on capital leases and other debt financings 
we pay interest on our promissory notes  capital leases and convertible long term debt 
we do not expect to incur material interest expense in the future as we have extinguished all of our outstanding debt as of december   and had invested the excess in investments available for sale 
income taxes we have not recognized any deferred tax assets or liabilities in our financial statements since we cannot assure their future realization 
because realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  a full valuation allowance has been recorded on the net deferred tax assets  which relate primarily to net operating loss and research and development carry forwards 
in the event that we become profitable within the next several years  we have net deferred tax assets before a valuation allowance of approximately million that may be utilized prior to us having to 
table of contents recognize any income tax expense or make payments to the taxing authorities 
utilization of our net operating loss carry forwards in any one year may be limited under irc section  and we could be subject to the alternative minimum tax  thereby potentially diminishing the value to us of this tax asset 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  deferred tax assets  share based compensation  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from collaborative agreements  research licenses  and a government contract 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues from collaboration agreements are evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 draft abstract  accounting for collaboration agreements 
management evaluates revenues from agreements that have multiple elements to determine whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
to recognize a delivered item in a multiple element arrangement  eitf issue no 
requires that the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  that there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items and that delivery or performance is probable and within our control for any delivered items that have a right of return 
the determination whether multiple elements of a collaboration agreement meet the criteria for separate units of accounting requires us to exercise judgments 
revenues from research licenses and government contracts are recognized as earned upon either the incurring of reimbursable expenses directly related to the particular research plan or the completion of certain development milestones as defined within the terms of the agreement 
payments received in advance of research performed are designated as deferred revenue 
non refundable upfront license fees and certain other related fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the development periods of the contract deliverables 
fees associated with substantive at risk  performance based milestones are recognized as revenue upon their completion  as defined in the respective agreements 
incidental assignment of technology rights is recognized as revenue as it is earned and received 
in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genzyme corporation for the development and commercialization of prochymal and chondrogen 
under the agreement  genzyme is obligated to pay to us non contingent  non refundable cash payments totaling million  with million paid during november and million scheduled to be paid on july  the agreement provides genzyme with certain rights to intellectual property developed by us  and requires 
table of contents that we continue to perform certain development work related to the subject products 
management has evaluated the deliverables related to these payments under eitf  and concluded that the various deliverables represent a single unit of accounting 
accordingly  we have deferred the recognition of revenue related to the upfront payments  and are amortizing these amounts to revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated delivery period of the required development services  which extend through the first quarter of the agreement also provides for contingent milestone payments of up to billion in the aggregate  as well as royalties to be paid to us on any sales by genzyme 
consistent with our revenue recognition policies  we will recognize revenue from these contingent milestone payments for which we have no continuing performance obligations upon achievement of the related milestone 
for any milestone payments for which we have a continuing performance obligation  the milestone payments will be deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the related performance obligations 
in  we partnered with genzyme to develop prochymal as a medical countermeasure to nuclear terrorism and other radiological emergencies 
in january  we were awarded a contract from the united states department of defense pursuant to which we  in partnership with genzyme  are seeking to develop and stockpile prochymal for the repair of gastrointestinal injury resulting from acute radiation exposure 
we began recognizing revenue under this contract during the first quarter of contract revenue is recognized as the related costs are incurred  in accordance with the terms of the contract 
in october  we entered into a collaborative agreement with the juvenile diabetes research foundation jdrf to conduct a phase ii clinical trial evaluating prochymal as a treatment for type diabetes mellitus 
this collaborative agreement provides for jdrf to provide up to million of contingent milestone funding to support the development of prochymal for the preservation of insulin production in patients with newly diagnosed type diabetes mellitus 
the contingent milestone payments under the agreement are amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the duration of our obligations under the collaborative agreement as they are earned 
in july  we launched our first commercial product  osteocel 
revenues on osteocel sales are recognized when legal title to the product has passed to the customer 
in april  we committed to a plan to sell the osteocel product line 
concurrent with the technology assets closing on july   we entered into a manufacturing agreement under which we will continue to manufacture osteocel for up to months and thereafter sell of the product to nuvasive at specified prices 
osteocel operations are accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements  and the prior period financial statements have been restated for comparative purposes 
we have entered into several strategic agreements with other pharmaceutical companies focusing on the development and commercialization of its stem cell drug products 
in  we entered into such an agreement with boston scientific corporation pertaining to our cardiac drug development and received a million fee for licensing the use of our technology 
we terminated the agreement with boston scientific corporation in and recognized the remaining unamortized license fee 
also in  we entered into a similar agreement with jcr pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
pertaining to our hematologic malignancies drugs for distribution in japan  and recognize revenue upon the achievement of milestone events specified in the agreement 
we also earn royalties on the sale of human mscs sold for research purposes and recognize the revenue on these sales as the sales are made 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value 
as of december  and  there was no allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable from continuing operations  as we believe the reported amounts are fully collectible 
accounts receivable balances are not collateralized

results of operations year ended december  compared to december  revenue total revenues increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million in the corresponding period in the increase is the result of the genzyme collaboration agreement and the dod contract  each of which was entered during  and the jdrf agreement entered into in revenues in included million of unamortized license fees that was recognized in upon the termination of the agreement with boston scientific corporation in december research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in research and development expenses in reflects the increased number of clinical trials in process versus the prior year and the resulting increases in clinical doses of our drug candidates 
we also incurred additional research and 
table of contents development costs in connection with the development of our biologics license application bla as we approach the commercialization of prochymal 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was attributable to additional personnel and related costs to support our expanded operations as we approach the anticipated commercialization of prochymal 
share based payments to related parties we pay fees to members of our board of directors through grants of our common stock and or a combination of stock and cash 
in  we issued  shares of common stock for services on the board and valued these shares at the then current closing price of our stock on the nasdaq global market  resulting in the million charge 
in  we also issued  shares of common stock for services on the board and recorded a million charge 
interest expense  net interest expense  net was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
interest expense decreased significantly in due to a reduced amount of debt outstanding throughout the year 
we did not have any debt outstanding as of december  interest expense in included million paid to related parties  as discussed more fully in note to the accompanying financial statements included in item to this annual report on form k 
interest expense in also includes a non cash charge of million resulting from the induced conversion of million of our convertible promissory notes into common stock and million of previously deferred debt financing fees 
year ended december  compared to december  revenue total revenues increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million in the corresponding period in our revenues in both years resulted primarily from licensing fees and royalties  and the increase in is due to the additional revenue recognized for the balance of the unamortized license fees under our collaborative agreement with boston scientific corporation  which was terminated in december research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in research and development expenses in reflects the increased number of clinical trials in process versus the prior year as well as higher costs associated with the phase iii clinical trials for prochymal 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in was attributable to our increased operations and costs related to our status as a publicly traded company following our ipo during the third quarter of 
table of contents related party expenses fees paid to related parties were million for the twelve months ended december  and were made in connection with pre ipo financings 
share based payments to related parties share based payments to related parties were million in for stock awards for services on our board of directors

friedli for service on our board of directors 
interest expense  net interest expense  net was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in resulted from the non cash charge of million resulting from the induced conversion of our convertible promissory notes and million of previously deferred debt financing fees compared to charges of million of previously deferred debt financing costs associated with debt that was converted in conjunction with our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity at december   we had million in cash and million in investments available for sale and million of short term receivables 
in addition  we had extinguished all of our outstanding debt as of that date 
cash flow years ended december  amounts in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities we generated cash from operating activities for the first time since our inception during the year ended december  the cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of the million of up front fees received under the collaboration agreement with genzyme 
we used a portion of these proceeds to completely extinguish our outstanding debt  and made net purchases of investments available for sale of million during the year with our excess cash 
we have progressively increased our clinical trial activities since inception as we strive to bring our biologic drug candidates to market  and we expect this trend will continue in the foreseeable future as our existing biologic drug candidates continue in their development cycles and we develop additional product opportunities 
although there can be no assurances  based on current expectations  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity on hand as of december  to fund our operations through the commercialization of prochymal for an initial indication 
prior to this year  we had historically financed our research and development activities through cash flows provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december  during that period  our continuing operations used million of cash  primarily reflecting our loss from continuing operations and cash used to fund operating assets  which was

capital resources our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and results of our research and preclinical development programs  the scope and results of our clinical trials  particularly regarding the number of patients required for our phase iii trials  the timing of and the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our biologic drug candidates  which could be more lengthy or complex than obtaining approval for a new conventional drug  given the fda s limited experience with late stage clinical trials and marketing approval for stem cell therapeutics  the timing and achievement of contingent milestone payments under the nuvasive agreement and the genzyme collaboration agreement 
the costs of maintaining  expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio  including possible litigation costs and liabilities  and the costs of enlarging our work force consistent with expanding our business and operations and status as a public company 
as of december   we had completely extinguished our outstanding debt 
as a result of our financial position and forecasts as of that date  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity on hand as of that date to fund our operations through the initial commercialization of our biological drug candidate 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and we have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations at december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based on the terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of item under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and certain assumptions 
future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts 
payment due by fiscal year contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years amounts in thousands operating lease facilities contract research organizations clinical manufacturing services agreement capital leases equipment interest payments total contractual cash obligations contract research organizations 
we utilize independent contract research organizations cros to perform the clinical trials of our biological drug candidates 
under the terms of these agreements  we design the protocol regarding the testing to be performed  and the cro enrolls the patients and testing sites  administers the trial  performs statistical analysis of the results  and compiles the final report 
we pay fees directly to the cros for their professional services  which may be payable upon specified trial milestones or as they provide services  depending on the structure of the contract 
we are also responsible for reimbursing the cros for certain pass through expenses they incur in administering the trial 
our agreements with cros provide for cancellation for various reasons 
in the event any of our agreements with cros are cancelled our liablities will be reduced 
the timing of our payments to the cros is dependent upon the progress of the various trials  which is highly variable dependent upon the speed with which the cros are able to enroll patients and testing sites 
as such  we are unable to specifically predict the timing of future payments to cros 
as of december   we had contracted with cros to perform six clinical trials which were in varying stages of completion 
the total contracted payments to cros under these agreements were million  of which we have incurred million 
although we cannot specifically predict the timing of the remaining payments  based on our current estimates and assumptions  we currently expect to make payments to the cros through as detailed above 
clinical manufacturing services agreement 
we have contracted for lot screening services for the isolation  growth  and differentiation of the mscs to be used in our biological drug candidates 
due to the long production cycle for mscs  we are obligated to provide a twelve month future forecast production plan  under which the counterparty will produce our required msc doses for a fixed price per dose 
the term of the agreement is five years  provided that we continue to provide a forecast production plan 
we have the right to terminate the contract with thirty days written notice 
in the event we terminate the contract  we are obligated for any in process production as of the termination date that has been initiated according to our production forecast 
accordingly  our minimum 
table of contents contractual commitment under this contract is limited to in process production at any given time 
our obligation would not extend for a period longer than twelve months  the maximum outlook of the production forecast 
based on our current forecast production plan  we estimate that our future minimum contractual commitments under this contract were million as of december  leases 
as previously discussed  we have executed an asset purchase agreement for the sale of our osteocel asset disposal group 
nuvasive has agreed to assume the lease to our columbia facility concurrent with the manufacturing asset closing under that agreement  which we expect to occur during the amount of our future lease payments for the columbia facility is dependent upon the occurrence and exact timing of the manufacturing assets closing 
accordingly  the table above includes all payments specified by the lease agreement 
effect of inflation 
inflation and changing prices are not generally a material factor affecting our business 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and lease costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk due to the short duration of our investment portfolio and the high quality of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any material degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
we believe that the interest rate risk related to our accounts receivable is not significant 
we manage the risk associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value for non collectability and establishment of appropriate allowances in connection with our internal controls and policies 
foreign current exchange rate risk we conduct clinical trial activities in areas that operate in a functional currency other than the united states dollar usd 
as a result  when the usd rises and falls against the functional currencies of these other nations  our costs will either increase or decrease by the relative change in the exchange rate 
foreign currency gains and losses were not significant during the three years ended december   and at the present time  we have elected not to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
derivative instruments we do not enter into hedging or derivative instrument arrangements
