table of contents segment income before provision for taxes in millions year ended december  advanced ceramic operations esk ceramics semicon associates thermo materials ceradyne canada boron inter segment elimination total segment income before provision for taxes we categorize our products into four market applications 
the table below shows the percentage contribution of our total sales to external customers of each market application in the different time periods 
year ended december  defense industrial automotive diesel commercial total the principal factor contributing to our growth in sales from through was increased demand by the us military for ceramic body armor that protects soldiers  which has been driven primarily by military conflicts such as those in iraq and afghanistan 
shipments of the current generation of esapi enhanced small arms protective inserts body armor for the us army represented of our total revenues and of our body armor revenues in these shipments were made against a million adjusted value indefinite delivery indefinite quantity id iq contract awarded to us in august and represent the final deliveries against that contract 
our sales also increased from through because of our acquisition of esk ceramics in august  our acquisition of minco  inc in july  our acquisition of eaglepicher boron  llc in august  which we renamed boron products  llc  and the recent expansion of our operations into china 
our sales declined in primarily because of reduction in shipments of body armor 
in october  we were awarded an id iq contract by the us army for the next ballistic threat generation of ceramic body armor plates  known as xsapi  as well as additional deliveries of the current generation of esapi plates 
this five year contract has a maximum value of billion 
however  we anticipate that the government will order either xsapi or esapi  but not both 
therefore  the total amount of this id iq award likely will not exceed billion over the life of the contract 
two of our competitors were awarded similar id iq contracts 
we expect that government orders under these contracts will be split among the three successful bidders  so the potential orders we may receive under our contract will likely be less than the billion possible total amount 
delivery orders under this contract have been delayed due primarily to a protest by one of our competitors 
because of this delay  we expect that initial production quantity delivery orders under these id iq contracts will not be issued until march or later 
however  there can be no assurance as to when or to what extent ceradyne will receive production quantity deliveries under its id iq contract 
since it is our policy to include in backlog only delivery orders with firm delivery dates  our backlog at december  does not include any amounts under this id iq contract 
based on our current backlog for ceramic body armor  we expect our shipments of ceramic body armor to be lower in fiscal year than in moreover  government contracts typically may be cancelled by the 
table of contents government at any time without penalty 
for the next several quarters  and perhaps longer  demand for ceramic body armor is likely to be the most significant factor affecting our sales 
although we believe that demand for ceramic body armor will continue for many years  the quantity and timing of government orders depends on a number of factors outside of our control  such as the amount of us defense budget appropriations and the level of international conflicts 
moreover  ceramic armor contracts generally are awarded in an open competitive bidding process 
therefore  our future level of sales of ceramic body armor will depend on the us military s continued demand for these products and our ability to successfully compete for and retain this business 
our esk ceramics subsidiary produces boron carbide powder  which serves as a starter ceramic powder in the manufacture of our lightweight ceramic body armor 
owning this source of our principal raw material  together with the substantial manufacturing capacity for ceramic armor at our lexington  kentucky plant and in our irvine  california facility  should allow us to fulfill current and anticipated demand for our ceramic body armor 
our order backlog was million as of december  and million as of december  orders for ceramic armor represented approximately million  or of the total backlog as of december  and million  or of the total backlog as of december  we expect that substantially all of our order backlog as of december  will be shipped during our sales to customers located outside of the united states have varied in recent years  representing million  or of net sales in  million  or of net sales in  and million  or of net sales in we currently have sales offices in germany  china  england and canada as well as commissioned independent sales representatives in other parts of europe and asia 
of our sales to customers located outside the united states  were denominated in us dollars during net sales 
our net sales consist primarily of revenues from the sale of products  which we recognize when an agreement of sale exists  the product has been delivered according to the terms of the sales order and collection is reasonably assured 
cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead expenses 
our business requires us to maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead 
as a result  our gross profit  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  is greatly impacted by our sales volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
additionally  because many of our products are customized  we are frequently required to devote resources to sustaining engineering expenses  which we also include in cost of product sales 
the cost of electricity comprises a significant portion of our cost of product sales 
in  we began expanding our high energy utilization silicon nitride manufacturing operations at our facility in lexington  kentucky  where costs  particularly for electricity and occupancy  are lower than in california 
we have increased our manufacturing capacity for the production of body armor plates by adding three hot press lines at this facility 
we chose this facility for the location of the hot press expansion for the same reasons lower cost of electricity and occupancy 
the cost of electricity for our manufacturing operations in the united states and europe was approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  and approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in selling expenses 
our selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for direct sales and marketing employees  commissions for direct sales employees and for independent sales representatives  trade show expenses  rent for our sales offices  product literature  and travel and entertainment expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  employee bonuses  which are computed quarterly and accrued in the quarter earned  professional service fees  rent for facilities and expenses for information technology 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  materials and supplies related to ongoing application engineering in response 
table of contents to customer requirements  and the research and development of new materials technology and products 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
review of historical stock option grant procedures in july  the company voluntarily initiated a review of its historical stock option grant practices and related accounting treatment 
the review was conducted by a special committee comprised of three independent members of the company s board of directors  with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic accounting experts 
the scope of the special committee s review included all stock options granted by the company from january through september the special committee has completed its review 
until september  stock option grants generally were approved by unanimous written consents signed by the members of the stock option committee of the board of directors 
throughout this period  the stock option committee consisted of the ceo and one other non management director 
the date specified as the grant date in each unanimous written consent was used i to determine the exercise price of the options and ii as the accounting measurement date 
the review found that from january through september  the date selected by management as the grant date and accounting measurement date was the date specified in the unanimous written consent  but that  in all but one case  the unanimous written consents were not prepared  approved or executed by the company s stock option committee until a later date 
there were a total of grant dates from january through september the company s ceo was responsible for selecting the grant dates and followed a consistent practice of seeking low grant prices and he was unaware of the accounting implications of the method he used 
therefore  the use of the date specified in the unanimous written consent as the accounting measurement date was incorrect in all but one case 
the proper accounting measurement date was the date the unanimous written consent was signed by the members of the stock option committee 
based upon information gathered during the review by independent legal counsel  the special committee and the board of directors have concluded that  while the company applied an option price date selection practice that resulted in the use of incorrect accounting measurement dates for options granted between january and september  the accounting errors resulting from the use of incorrect measurement dates were not the product of any deliberate or intentional misconduct by the company or its executives  staff or board of directors 
however  as a result of using revised measurement dates for options granted from january through september  the company recorded a charge in the second quarter ended june  of million million after income taxes pertaining to the years ended december  to and the six months ended june  the stock based charge 
the stock based charge was included as a component of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income as this is where the affected individual s normal compensation costs are recorded 
the stock based charge includes non cash compensation expense of million million after income taxes primarily related to stock option grants made during the period from january through september that should have been measured as compensation cost at the actual stock option grant dates  and subsequently amortized to expense over the vesting period for each stock option grant 
the stock based charge also includes million million after income taxes of estimated additional employment and other taxes that are expected to become payable 
from september to february  all stock option grants were approved at meetings held by the stock option committee  and  since february  all stock option grants have been approved at meetings held by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
the dates of these meetings have been used correctly as the accounting measurement date for all stock options granted since september had this estimated stock based charge been reflected  as and when incurred  in the company s results of operations for prior years  the impact on net income for ceradyne s fiscal years ended december would have been a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  and a reduction of  in as of 
table of contents december   the total remaining incremental stock based compensation charge related to these stock option grants that are expected to vest in future periods with a revised accounting measurement date is immaterial 
there was no impact on revenue or net cash provided by operating activities as a result of the estimated compensation charge 
the company does not believe that a restatement of its prior period financial statements is required for the stock based charge 
based on the materiality guidelines contained in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 materiality sab  the company believes that the stock based charge is not material to any of the individual prior periods affected and the aggregate stock based charge is not material to the results for the year ended december  prior to december   the current members of ceradyne s board of directors  all current executive officers and all other employees of the company amended all unexercised stock options they held which had an exercise price that is less than the price of the company s common stock on the actual date of grant  by increasing the exercise price to an amount equal to the closing price of the common stock as of the actual grant date 
the company has and will continue to reimburse all non executive officer employees for the increase in the exercise price for the modified options as they vest 
such reimbursement has and will not be material 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items from our financial statements for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administration acquisition related charge research and development income from operations other income expense income before provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the corresponding prior year period 
our advanced ceramic operations division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the primary reason for this decrease was that shipments of ceramic body and other armor components for defense customers amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from million of net sales in the prior year due to reduced demand from the us department of defense 
the decrease in armor sales was partially offset by a million increase in net sales of our automotive diesel component product line  including cam rollers  from million in to million in the primary reason for the increase in sales of the automotive diesel component product line was million of shipments of ceramic 
table of contents cam rollers to our north american automotive suppliers because their customers were making forward purchases of the current engine which is being replaced by a new  more expensive engine 
the remaining increase of million was due to more ceramic cam rollers shipped to european suppliers for use in off highway engines 
our esk ceramics subsidiary had net sales for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
approximately million of the sales in are attributable to a higher value of the euro versus the us dollar in compared to sales of industrial products for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
on a constant currency basis  sales of industrial products for the year ended december  decreased by million 
sales of automotive diesel products for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
on a constant currency basis  sales of automotive diesel products for the year ended december  decreased by million 
the decreases in sales on a constant currency basis for industrial and automotive diesel products were primarily the result of a severe economic contraction in the fourth quarter of sales of defense products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or from the million in the prior year 
included in sales of defense products for the year ended december  were inter segment sales of million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million of shipments to our advanced ceramic operations division 
the balance of the decrease was due to a reduction in sales of boron carbide powder to third parties in the defense industry for the year ended december   because their sales of ceramic body armor declined 
on a constant currency basis  sales of defense products decreased by million for the year ended december  our semicon associates division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the increase in sales reflects higher shipments of microwave and laser cathodes of million  this was partially offset by lower shipments of cathode ray tubes and magnets in when compared to our thermo materials division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the increase was due in part to the growth of million in sales of crucibles used in the manufacture of photovoltaic cells for the solar energy markets  including million by our new operation in china 
also contributing to the increase in sales during was million in sales  including inter company sales  as a result of a full year inclusion of the financial results of minco  inc which we acquired and initially consolidated commencing july  sales to the defense industry were higher by million due to increased demand for ceramic missile radomes 
our ceradyne canada subsidiary had net sales for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the increase in sales reflects higher shipments of our boral product line to the nuclear industry of million 
this was partially offset by a million reduction in sales of metal matrix composite products 
our boron segment which includes our ceradyne boron products subsidiary  which we acquired on august   and our semequip  inc subsidiary  which we acquired on august  had net sales for the year ended december   of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the increase in sales was the result of a full year consolidation in of the ceradyne boron products subsidiary while results in included net sales for the period from september to december  also contributing to the increase was the consolidation as of august  of the results of semequip  inc  which had sales of million for the period from august through december  gross profit 
our gross profit for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was the result of lower sales  
table of contents particularly of body armor  resulting in a poorer sales mix and lower operating leverage resulting in less absorption of manufacturing overhead expenses 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily caused by the decrease in body armor and other armor component sales  this resulted in a reduction of million of gross profit compared to results 
this decrease was partially offset by gross profit from the increased sales of ceramic crucibles and the full year consolidation in of operations of our minco  inc and ceradyne boron products subsidiaries  both of which were acquired in our advanced ceramic operations division posted gross profit for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales were decreased sales of body armor  resulting in poorer sales mix and lower operating leverage causing manufacturing overhead to be under absorbed 
our esk ceramics subsidiary had a gross profit for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the decrease in gross profit and in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was the result of increased labor and electricity expenses  continued price reductions in our evaporation boat and our functional coating businesses due to competitive forces  and a reduction in higher margin boron carbide powder sales to external customers 
our semicon associates division had gross profit for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit and in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was due primarily to price increases that were successfully passed on to customers of our microwave and laser cathodes products 
our thermo materials division had gross profit for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the improvements in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales were primarily due to lower sales of fused silica and casting product lines which have lower gross margins and an increase in the sales of crucibles which have higher gross margins 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was the full year consolidation in of operations of our minco  inc subsidiary  which was initially consolidated as of july  our ceradyne canada subsidiary had gross profit for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  from a negative gross profit of million in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was due to an improved sales mix caused by increased sales of our boral product line in and higher operating leverage 
our ceradyne boron segment  which includes our ceradyne boron products subsidiary  which we acquired on august   and our semequip  inc subsidiary  which we acquired on august   had gross profit of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily caused by a million gross loss from the results of semequip  inc which were consolidated from august  our ceradyne boron products subsidiary had gross profit of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
contributing to the decrease were poor manufacturing yields and a decrease in sales of higher margin products to the semiconductor industry when compared to selling expenses 
our selling expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
selling expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  selling expenses at our esk ceramics subsidiary  which constitute a relatively large 
table of contents portion of the total  are denominated in euros and increase when translated into dollars at lower exchange rates  this caused an increase of million in selling expenses in other factors contributing to the increase were million of additional selling expenses due to the full year consolidation in of the results of our ceradyne boron products which was initially consolidated commencing september   million of additional selling expenses due to the full year consolidation in of our minco subsidiary which was initially consolidated commencing july   and million of selling expenses due to the inclusion of the results of our recently acquired semequip  inc subsidiary 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in headcount and related personnel and travel expenses of million at our aco division 
the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to a reduction in net sales that was not fully offset by a proportionate decrease in selling expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  the consolidation of the operations of our minco  inc and ceradyne boron products subsidiaries for all of and the consolidation of our semequip  inc subsidiary commencing as of august   contributed million to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses also increased in due to a million increase in professional fees for auditing  tax and information technology consulting services  and due to million of additional expenses in connection with the expansion of our business in china 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bonus payments of million as a result of a decrease in pre tax income in compared to acquisition related charge 
we incurred an acquisition related compensation charge of million for the year ended december  associated with a pre closing commitment by semequip  inc for incentive compensation for several of its employees and advisors 
this million charge includes million of cash paid by ceradyne at closing  and the balance represents the discounted present value of the portion of the estimated contingent consideration payable as incentive compensation to these employees and advisors over years 
for additional information regarding this acquisition  see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements commencing at page f of this report 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
research and development expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  the primary reason for these decreases were the reduction in expenses associated with the development of next generation body armor products and the development of combat vehicle armor 
other income expense 
our net other income and expense for the year ended december  was a net expense of million  a decrease of million  or  from million of other net income in the prior year 
there were two principal reasons for this decrease 
we earned million less interest income on our cash balances and short term marketable securities because of a substantial decline in interest rates in we also incurred charges of million for impairment due to other than temporary reductions in the value of our investments in auction rate securities 
interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately million  a decrease of  or  from million in the prior year 
income before provision for income taxes 
our income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
our advanced ceramic operations division s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the decrease in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was a result of lower sales of body armor and a decrease in gross margins as a result of a poorer sales mix and lower operating leverage 

table of contents our esk ceramics subsidiary s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the decrease in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was the result of increased labor and electricity expenses  continued price reductions in our evaporation boat and our functional coating businesses due to competitive forces  a reduction in higher margin boron carbide powder sales to external customers and the negative impact of the exchange rate of the euro when compared to the us dollar 
our semicon associates division s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  or  from million in the prior year 
the increase in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was a result of higher sales of our microwave and laser cathodes products resulting in improved sales mix and operating leverage 
our thermo materials division s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the increase in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was due to a sales mix change from lower sales of fused silica and casting product lines which have lower gross margins and an increase in the sales of crucibles  primarily in china  and defense products which have higher gross margins 
the operations of our minco  inc subsidiary  which were consolidated for all of compared to only part of  contributed million to the increase in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  compared to a contribution of  in the prior year 
our ceradyne canada subsidiary s loss before provision for income taxes improved to  for the year ended december   from a loss before provision for taxes of million in the prior year 
the decrease in the loss before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was due to an improved sales mix caused by increased sales of our boral product line in compared to and higher operating leverage 
our boron segment s loss before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from income before provision for income taxes of million in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily caused by a million loss before provision for income taxes incurred by our semequip  inc subsidiary  which we acquired on august  included in the loss was a million acquisition related compensation charge associated with a pre closing commitment by semequip  inc for incentive compensation for several of its employees and advisors 
semequip is a late stage development company that incurred operating losses in connection with the development and marketing of cluster molecules such as bh for use in the ion implantation of boron b in the manufacturing of semiconductors 
we anticipate that semequip will continue to incur operating losses for the next two fiscal years 
additionally  our boron products subsidiary incurred a loss before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of million due to a reduction of sales of high margin products to the semiconductor industry as a result of a business contraction in that industry and poor manufacturing yields 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year resulted from a higher proportion of our pre tax income originating from our operations in china where we did not pay income tax 
income taxes also decreased because pre tax income was lower in compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the corresponding prior year period 
our advanced ceramic operations division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
the primary 
table of contents reason for this improvement was the shipment of million of ceramic body and other armor components for defense customers  an increase of million  or  from the million of net sales in the prior year due to increased demand from the us department of defense 
net sales for our automotive diesel component product line  including cam rollers  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
the primary reasons for this decrease were that our customers produced less heavy duty diesel truck engines in and two of our customers replaced some of our ceramic cam rollers with cheaper steel products 
net sales of our orthodontic brackets product line were million  an increase of  or  from the million in the prior year 
our esk ceramics subsidiary had net sales for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
approximately million of this increase is attributable to a higher value of the euro versus the us dollar in compared to sales of industrial products for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
this increase was the result of a higher demand for fluid handling and industrial wear parts 
sales of automotive diesel products for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
this was caused by sales to new original equipment manufacturer oem customers in sales of defense products for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
included in sales of defense products for the year ended december  were inter segment sales of million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease was due to a decrease of million in sales of boron carbide powder to third parties in the defense industry for the year ended december   partially offset by an increase of  in sales of boron carbide powder to our advanced ceramic operations division 
third parties purchased less boron carbide powder in because their sales of ceramic body armor declined 
our semicon associates division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
the decrease in sales reflects lower shipments of microwave and laser cathodes of million and  of magnets in when compared to our thermo materials division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
the increase was due to an increase of million in sales of crucibles used in the manufacture of photovoltaic cells for the solar energy markets 
of this increase  million was from sales of crucibles manufactured by our new operation in china 
also contributing million of the increase in sales was the consolidation of our acquisition  minco  inc  as of july  offsetting these increases  were a decline in sales to the defense industry and a reduction in sales of ceramic rollers to the glass industry 
our ceradyne canada subsidiary  which commenced operations in july  had net sales for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or from the million in the prior year 
the increase was due to a full year of operations in compared to only six months in  and an increase in sales of metal matrix composite products 
our ceradyne boron subsidiary  which we acquired on august   had net sales for the four month period ended december  of million 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was the result of increased sales  particularly of body armor  improved sales mix and higher operating leverage 
the increase in gross profit was primarily caused by the increase in body armor sales and the inclusion of our acquisitions during of minco  inc and ceradyne boron products in our consolidated results of operations 
our advanced ceramic operations division posted gross profit of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a 
table of contents percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the primary reasons for the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales were increased sales of body armor  improved sales mix and higher operating leverage 
our esk ceramics subsidiary had a gross profit of million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to gross profit of million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was the result of increased labor and electricity expenses  continued price reductions in our evaporation boat business due to competitive forces and a reduction in higher margin armor sales to external customers 
our semicon associates division had gross profit of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit and in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  were due primarily to sales returns and losses in our magnet business and lower sales of microwave and laser cathodes resulting in higher per unit manufacturing expenses 
our thermo materials division had gross profit of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the improvements in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales were primarily due to lower sales of fused silica and casting product lines which have lower gross margins and an increase in the sales of crucibles which have higher gross margins 
also contributing million of the increase in gross profit was the consolidation of our new acquisition  minco  inc  as of july  our ceradyne canada subsidiary  which commenced operations in july  had a gross loss for the year ended december  of million  an increase in the gross loss of million  or  from the million gross loss in the prior year 
the increase in the gross loss was caused by the continuation of start up expenses and higher scrap rates 
our ceradyne boron subsidiary  which we acquired on august   contributed million of gross profit for the four month period ended december  selling expenses 
our selling expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
selling expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to higher personnel expenses that could not be offset by price increases to customers 
increases in the number of employees and related personnel expenses and an additional million of selling expenses from the consolidations of our acquisitions of minco  inc as of july  and ceradyne boron products as of september  primarily accounted for the increase in selling expenses for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  contributing million to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was the consolidation of our acquisitions of minco  inc and ceradyne boron products 
also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were increases in the number of employees and related personnel expenses  including increased bonus accruals as a result of the company s higher operating profits 
the comparison to the prior year was favorably impacted by a non cash charge of million in the second quarter of based on the results of our special committee s review of our historical stock option practices  including our underlying option grant documentation and procedures  as described in more detail above under the caption overview review of historical stock option grant procedures  and a related charge for payroll tax and penalties of million 

table of contents research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
research and development expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  the primary reason for these increases were development of next generation body armor products and the continuing development of combat vehicle armor 
other income expense 
our net other income for the year ended december  was million  compared to net other income of million in the prior year 
the primary reason for the increase was an increase in interest income received from investing higher cash balances in short term marketable securities 
offsetting this was a charge of million for impairment due to the other than temporary reduction in the value of our investments in auction rate securities 
interest expense was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
income before provision for income taxes 
our income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
our advanced ceramic operations division s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the increase in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was a result of higher sales of body armor and an increase in gross margins as a result of improved sales mix and higher operating leverage 
our esk ceramics subsidiary s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the decrease in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was the result of increased labor and electricity expenses  higher selling expenses due to increases in the number of employees and related personnel expenses  higher research and development expenses because of the development of next generation ceramic powders for body armor products  and the negative impact of the exchange rate of the euro when compared to the us dollar 
our semicon associates division s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  or  from million in the prior year 
the decrease in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was a result of lower sales of our microwave and laser cathodes products resulting in higher per unit manufacturing expenses  and sales returns and losses in our magnet business 
our thermo materials division s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the increase in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was primarily due to a sales mix change due to lower sales of fused silica and casting product lines which have lower gross margins and an increase in the sales of crucibles which have higher gross margins 
also contributing to the increase in income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  of operating profit from our new acquisition  minco  inc our ceradyne canada subsidiary s loss before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the increase in the loss before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was caused by the continuation of start up expenses  higher scrap rates and lower sales resulting in higher per unit expenses 
our ceradyne boron product subsidiary s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to in the corresponding prior year period 
the 
table of contents increase in the effective tax rate results from higher state tax rates due to apportionment of more sales inside of california and decreases in extraterritorial income related deductions 
these increases to the effective tax rate were partially offset by an increase in the manufacturing deduction 
liquidity and capital resources we generally have met our operating and capital requirements with cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock 
our net cash position increased by million during the year ended december   compared to a million increase during the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to million 
the primary factors contributing to cash flow from operating activities in the year ended december   were net income of million  and adjustments of non cash amounts related to depreciation and amortization of million  stock compensation of million  and million of unrealized losses on auction rate securities 
also contributing to the increase in cash flow from operating activities was a decrease in accounts receivable and other receivables of million due to lower sales compared to the previous year  a decrease in production tooling of million due to lower production volume  an increase of million in other long term liabilities due primarily to the accrual of the pre acquisition commitment by semequip  inc to pay incentive compensation to several of its employees and advisors  and an increase of million in the accrual for employee benefits at our esk and boron products subsidiaries due to poor investment results during at their respective pension funds 
these contributions to our cash flow from operating activities were offset in part by deferred income taxes of million  increased levels of inventories of million  an increase of million in prepaid expenses due to an increase in tax deposits  and decreases of million in accounts payable  million in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
higher levels of inventories were largely caused by a increase in raw materials and finished goods inventory in connection with the expansion of our ceramic crucible business in china and in the united states  an increase of million at our boron segment and an increase of million in inventory at our esk subsidiary 
esk experienced rapidly declining sales in the fourth quarter of and due to long lead times in their production cycle could not reduce their inventory levels quick enough to offset the decline in sales during the quarter 
these increases in inventory levels were partially offset by a decrease of million in inventories at our aco division because of a reduction in sales in decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were caused by lower levels of business activity at our aco division 
income taxes payable decreased because of lower levels of pre tax net income in compared to investing activities consumed million of our cash for the year ended december  this included million for acquisitions  comprising million net of million cash received for the acquisition of semequip  inc and million for the acquisition certain assets and developed technology related to proprietary technical ceramic bearing patents and intellectual property 
we also spent million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
included in this amount is million for additional capacity for the production of ceramic crucibles at our china and atlanta facilities  an additional to support the production of raw materials at our minco subsidiary that are consumed in the production of the ceramic crucibles  million for the purchase of land and buildings to expand our general production capacity at our esk ceramics subsidiary s plant in kempten  germany  million to increase capacity for the fluid handling product line at esk and million for rolling mill equipment to support future growth at our canada segment 
these expenditures were partially offset by million of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
financing activities during the year ended december  consumed net cash of million 
during the year  we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million under a stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
we are authorized to repurchase and retire an additional million for a total of million 
the negative effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents of million during the year ended december  was due to our investment in our german subsidiary  esk ceramics  and in our chinese subsidiary  ceradyne tianjin technical ceramics  ltd 

table of contents our net cash position increased by million during the year ended december   compared to a million decrease during the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to million 
the primary factors contributing to cash flow from operating activities in the year ended december   were net income of million  and adjustments of non cash amounts related to depreciation and amortization of million and stock compensation of million 
a decrease in production tooling and prepaid expenses of million and increases in other liabilities and other long term liability of million added an aggregate of million to cash flow 
these contributions were offset in part by deferred income taxes of million  increase in accounts receivable and other receivables of million due to higher amounts of sales over the previous year  increased levels of inventories of million  and decreased levels of accounts payable  accrued expenses  income tax payable and employee benefits that added an aggregate of million 
the increase in inventory was due to the increase in sales and production to support the growth of the advanced ceramic operations segment 
during the year ended december   we used million of our cash for investing activities 
uses of cash included million for capital expenditures  million in acquisition costs related to the purchases of minco  inc and ceradyne boron products  purchases of marketable securities of million and we allocated million of cash to a restricted status 
capital expenditures included million to construct a building and purchase equipment for our expansion in china for the production of ceramic crucibles used to manufacture photovoltaic solar cells and million for the expansion at esk ceramics for increased production capacity for our boroneige boron nitride product line 
proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities added million of cash flow from investing activities 
financing activities during the year ended december  provided net cash of million 
we received cash proceeds of  relating to the issuance of common stock under our stock plan  and proceeds of million from issuance of stock due to exercise of stock options and the gross tax benefit of million due to exercise of stock options and issuance of stock upon vesting of restricted stock units 
the effect of exchange rates on cash and equivalents was a positive million due to our investments in our german subsidiary  esk ceramics  and in our chinese subsidiary  ceradyne tianjin technical ceramics co  ltd 
during december  we issued million principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due december  interest on the notes is payable on december and june of each year  commencing on june  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock for each  principal amount of the notes which represents a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes are convertible only under certain circumstances  including if the price of our common stock reaches  or the trading price of the notes falls below  specified thresholds  if the notes are called for redemption  if specified corporate transactions or fundamental change occur  or during the trading days prior to maturity of the notes 
we may redeem the notes at any time after december   for a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest as described below  if any  up to but excluding the redemption date 
with respect to each  principal amount of the notes surrendered for conversion  we will deliver the conversion value to holders as follows an amount in cash equal to the lesser of a the aggregate conversion value of the notes to be converted and b  and if the aggregate conversion value of the notes to be converted is greater than  an amount in shares or cash equal to such aggregate conversion value in excess of  the notes contain put options  which may require us to repurchase in cash all or a portion of the notes on december   december   december   december   and december  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest as described below  if any  to but excluding the repurchase date 
we are obligated to pay contingent interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period from june to december and from december to june  commencing with the six month period beginning december  and ending on june   if the average trading price of the note for the five trading 
table of contents day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant contingent interest period equals  of the principal amount of a note or more 
the amount of contingent interest payable per note for any relevant contingent interest period shall equal per annum of the average trading price of a note for the five trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant contingent interest period 
in december  we established an unsecured million bank line of credit 
as of december   there were no outstanding amounts on the line of credit 
however  the available line of credit at december  has been reduced by outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million 
the interest rate on the credit line is based on the libor rate for a period of one month plus a margin of percent  which equaled percent as of december  there is an additional charge per quarter based on a ratio of funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
for the quarter ended december   based on this ratio the additional charge for the unused portion of the credit line amounted to percent of the undisbursed portion of the credit line 
pursuant to the bank line of credit  the company is subject to certain covenants  which include  among other things  the maintenance of specified minimum amounts of tangible net worth and quick assets to current liabilities ratio 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   compared to million at december  at december   we had working capital of million  compared to million at december  our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies  and the repatriation of those cash balances from our esk ceramics subsidiary does not result in additional tax costs 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash available from the sale of short term investments  cash available from additional borrowings under our revolving line of credit and cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
our anticipated capital requirements primarily relate to the possible expansion of our manufacturing facilities in china and normal replacements of equipment 
we also may utilize cash  and  to the extent necessary  borrowings from time to time to acquire other businesses  technologies or product lines that complement our current products  enhance our market coverage  technical capabilities or production capacity  or offer growth opportunities 
we have no present agreements for any material acquisitions 
our material contractual obligations and commitments as of december  are as follows amounts in thousand payments due by period less than after total year years years years debt  principal amount capital lease obligations non cancelable leases pension benefits information technology services cash commitments for interest expense utility contract total contractual obligations as of december   we have million of uncertain tax positions 
we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding settlement of these uncertain tax positions  and as a result  they have been excluded from the table 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the only off balance sheet arrangement is the conversion feature of our convertible senior subordinated notes discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements which begin on page f of this report 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  any temporary or other than temporary impairment of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses the assistance of outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
sales recognition 
sales are recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  the product has been delivered according to the terms of the sales order and collection is reasonably assured 
management is required to make judgments about whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we reduce revenue with reserves for sales returns 
allowances  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  are based upon historical sales returns 
we do not record a warranty reserve on the sale of our products 
for our largest product line  body armor  all of which is sold to the us government  each lot of body armor is tested at an independent laboratory and the lot cannot be released for shipment to the us government until positive test results are received by both the us government and us 
for our non body armor sales  we have experienced minimal claims from these types of sales 
additionally  due to the inherent nature  strength  durability and structural properties of ceramics  as well as a rigid quality control program that includes  for some of our customers  having the customer accept quality test results prior to shipment  we do not believe a warranty reserve is necessary 
accounts receivable 
we review our trade accounts receivables and our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different aging categories and establish allowances based on the length of time receivables are past due based on contractual terms 
a write off will occur if the settlement of the account receivable is less than the carrying amount or we ultimately determine the balance will not be 
table of contents collected 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ materially from the amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for doubtful accounts in the financial statements included in this report beginning on page f inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the write down of inventory for obsolete items is based on our estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of inventory items 
in estimating the allowance  we rely on our knowledge of the industry as well as our current inventory levels 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ from the estimated amounts 
inventory costs include the cost of material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal for long lived assets sfas long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flow over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flow discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other assets and liabilities 
goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas goodwill is not being amortized  but instead is subject to an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill as of the fiscal year end in the fourth quarter of each year 
goodwill is allocated to six reporting units  which represent the company s operating segments 
the company has defined its reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level  as defined by sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company s reporting units are advanced ceramics operations  semicon associates  thermo materials  esk ceramics  ceradyne canada and ceradyne boron products 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value 
fair value was determined based on discounted cash flows and market multiples for each business unit with significant goodwill 
we compared each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the use of discounted cash flows requires that we make various economic  market and business assumptions in developing our internal forecasts  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital that reflect our best estimates when performing the annual impairment test 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable 
however  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change in the future which may then cause us to later conclude that an impairment exists  or with hindsight  it may appear that we could have understated the extent of impairment based on new information that was unknown at the prior testing date 
we may incur a goodwill impairment charge in the future  if for example  the market price of our stock materially declines  if the financial results of our operations deteriorate or other circumstances require an impairment charge 
at december   our net book value was below our market capitalization 
based on a control factor that was considered and the discounted cash flows used in our assessment  an impairment to goodwill was not warranted at december  at december   no impairment of goodwill had occurred 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the economic consumption method 
pension 
the company provides pension benefits to its employees of its subsidiaries of esk ceramics and ceradyne boron products 
for the pension plans of both subsidiaries  we make several assumptions that 
table of contents are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans 
these key assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
in selecting the expected long term rate of return on assets  we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plans 
this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan 
the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due 
in addition the expense and liabilities of the plan were determined using other assumptions for future experience  such as mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated  which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less than two years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
our long term investments at december  included million of auction rate securities net of a pre tax temporary impairment charge of million against accumulated other comprehensive income and a pre tax other than temporary impairment charge of million against earnings 
the company s investments in ars represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of residential and commercial mortgages or credit cards  insurance securitizations and other structured credits  including corporate bonds 
these auction rate securities are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
during the second half of the year  the auctions for these securities failed 
as a result of current negative conditions in the global credit markets  auctions for the company s investment in these securities have recently failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid through the normal auction process and may be liquid if a buyer is found outside the auction process 
the company reviews impairments associated with the above in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf and fsp sfas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other than temporary 
the company believes that a portion of the impairment of its auction rate securities investments is temporary and a portion is other than temporary 

table of contents we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
average maturity of our investment portfolio is days  therefore  the movement of interest rates should not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statement 
at any time  a significant increase decrease in interest rates will have an impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve  which are representative of historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers our investment and is based on the weighted average maturity of our investments as of december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately million at december  and approximately  at december  similarly a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investments of approximately million at december  and approximately  at december  actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuer of the securities may have the right to repurchase such securities 
we classify short term investments in current assets  as all such investments are available for current operations 
we are not exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt as it is fixed rate debt 
consequently  we do not utilize interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments regarding our debt 
foreign currency fluctuations we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management team to focus its attention on its core business operations 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges 
we measure the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
revenues  costs and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income miscellaneous
