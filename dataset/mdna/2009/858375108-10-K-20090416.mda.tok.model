item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview stein mart s stores offer the fashion merchandise  service and presentation of a better department or specialty store  at prices up to percent off department or specialty store original prices  every day 
our focused assortment of merchandise features current season moderate to better fashion apparel for women and men  as well as accessories  gifts  linens and shoes 
management believes that stein mart differentiates itself from typical off price retail chains by offering i primarily current season merchandise carried by better department or specialty stores  ii at moderate to better price levels  iii a stronger merchandising statement  consistently offering more depth of color and size in individual stock keeping units  and iv merchandise presentation and customer service more comparable to other upscale retailers 
the company faces competition for customers and for access to quality merchandise from department or specialty stores and  to a lesser degree  from off price retail chains 
many of these competitors are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than the company 
the retail apparel industry is highly fragmented and competitive  and the off price retail business may become even more competitive in the future

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventories 
capital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds  a revolving credit facility and credit terms from vendors 
working capital is needed to support store inventories and capital investments for new store openings and to maintain existing stores 
historically  the company s working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and highest in either the third or fourth quarter in anticipation of the fourth quarter peak selling season 
as of january   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in despite the increased net loss  cash provided by operating activities increased million over the increase was primarily due to million less cash used for inventories  a million decrease in cash used for income taxes receivable payable and million more cash provided by other operating activities  offset by million less cash provided by net loss plus non cash charges and million more cash used to reduce accounts payable 
less cash was needed for income taxes in due to a significant income tax receivable recorded at february  inventories decreased in compared to due to lower sales resulting in less inventory being purchased and lower inventory levels 
operating cash flows for decreased million from due to a million decrease in cash provided by net income loss plus non cash charges  a million increase in cash used for income taxes receivable payable and a million increase in cash used for other working capital accounts excluding inventory 
inventories decreased million in and increased million in inventories decreased in compared to due to lower sales resulting in less inventory being purchased and lower inventory levels 
net cash used in provided by investing activities was million in  million in and million in the net liquidation of short term investments provided million and million of cash in and  respectively 
capital expenditures were higher in due primarily to remodeling costs for existing stores and the roll out of new point of sale equipment and software 
capital expenditures were lower in compared to primarily due to fewer new stores opened 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in more cash was provided by financing activities during primarily due to higher net borrowings  no cash dividends paid and fewer shares of common stock repurchased 
in february  the board of directors suspended the payment of a quarterly dividend in order to conserve cash until improvements occur in the company s business and in the current difficult economic conditions 
dividends paid were higher in compared to due to a special dividend of per share totaling million 
the company expects to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in the cost of opening a new store in ranged from  to  for fixtures  equipment  leasehold improvements and pre opening costs primarily advertising  stocking and training 
pre opening costs are expensed at the time of opening 
initial inventory investment for a new store is approximately  the company has a million senior revolving secured credit agreement the agreement with a group of lenders which extends through january borrowings are based on and collateralized primarily by eligible inventory 
during the third quarter of  the company borrowed an additional million under the agreement to increase its cash position while building seasonal inventories and approaching peak borrowing needs and in light of uncertainties in the credit markets at that time 
at january   the company had million in direct borrowings  million of outstanding standby letters of credit and million invested in short term us treasury money market funds 
subsequent to year end  the company liquidated these money market funds and repaid that portion of its borrowings 
approximately million was available under the agreement at january  and the company is in compliance with the terms of the agreement 
although our cash provided by operating activities may be negatively affected by general economic conditions  we believe that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations  which  along with our available cash and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement  will provide the means needed to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
while we have available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement  tightening of the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through public or private equity or debt financing 
the effects of these changes could also require us to make additional changes to our current plans and strategies 

table of contents contractual obligations to facilitate an understanding of the company s contractual obligations  the following payments due by period data is provided in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases total long term debt represents the direct borrowings at january  under our senior revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in january future annual interest payments have been excluded from the above table because they cannot be accurately estimated due to the variable interest rates in our senior revolving credit agreement 
other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  deferred compensation  deferred rent liability  postretirement benefit liability and other long term liabilities that do not have specific due dates  so are excluded from the preceding table 
other long term liabilities also include long term store closing reserves  a component of which is future minimum payments under non cancelable leases for closed stores 
these future minimum lease payments total million and are included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million securing certain insurance programs at january  if certain conditions were to occur under these arrangements  the company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  the company does not expect to make any payments  therefore  the letters of credit are excluded from the preceding table 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements that could affect the financial condition of the company 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal in nature with a higher percentage of the company s merchandise sales and earnings generated in the fall and holiday selling seasons 
accordingly  sg a expenses are typically higher as a percent of net sales during the first three quarters of each year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while the company believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies retail inventory method and inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
the use of rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail values of inventories 
based on a review of historical markdowns  current business trends and seasonal inventory categories  additional inventory reserves may be recorded to reflect estimated markdowns which may be required to liquidate certain inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes its inventory valuation methods approximate the net realizable value of clearance inventory and result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we perform physical inventory counts at all stores annually 
included in the carrying value of merchandise inventories is a reserve for shrinkage 
shrinkage is estimated based on historical physical inventory results as a percentage of sales for the year 
the difference between actual and estimated amounts in any year may cause fluctuations in quarterly results  but is not a factor in full year results 
vendor allowances 
the company receives allowances from some of its vendors primarily related to markdown reimbursement  damaged defective merchandise and vendor compliance issues 
vendor allowances are recorded when earned 
allowances received from vendors related to profitability of inventory recently sold are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold in the 
table of contents later of the period that the merchandise markdown is incurred or the allowance is negotiated 
allowances received from vendors related to damaged defective inventory are reflected as reductions to the cost of merchandise as it is received 
allowances received due to compliance issues primarily violations of shipping and merchandise preparation requirements are reflected as a reduction of the cost of the merchandise when negotiated 
although it is unlikely that there will be a significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support  if a reduction were to occur  the company could experience higher cost of merchandise sold 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
for long lived assets held for use  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets 
impairment reviews are performed for individual stores during the fourth quarter  or more frequently should circumstances change 
a significant change in cash flows or estimated market values could result in an increase in asset impairment charges 
the economic downturn experienced during had a significant impact on the retail industry and our operating results 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in pre tax asset impairment charges related to stores closed in  stores closing in and certain other under performing stores 
store closing costs 
the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  to record store closing costs 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred 
lease termination costs are recorded net of estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained for the properties 
in the event the company is not successful in subleasing closed store locations  additional store closing costs may be recorded 
insurance reserves 
the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by the covered employees 
the company is responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are estimated actuarially  based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions 
as of january  and february   insurance reserves of million and million  respectively  were included in accrued liabilities 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in trends and other actuarial assumptions have not been significant in  and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook  and although the company was profitable in and posted a small loss in  the results in produced a cumulative three year loss  which is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome 
accordingly  the company established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million through a charge to tax expense 
income tax reserves 
the company records liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to federal and state income taxes in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
these liabilities reflect the company s best estimate of its ultimate income tax liability based on the tax code  regulations  and pronouncements of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
estimating our ultimate tax liability involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions 
if the company s actual results differ from estimated results  the company s effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change
