item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview was a challenging year for the economy  the lodging industry and the company 
all of the economic statistics that we utilize as indicators to forecast demand and evaluate the health of our business weakened dramatically throughout the year 
as such  our revenue per available room revpar  funds from operations ffo per diluted share and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda per diluted share declined as compared to our business has been significantly impacted by the economic crisis and specifically  the pressure on most businesses to reduce spending including travel  meetings of all kinds  as well as the hesitance of the leisure customer to spend money as many have been personally impacted by the economic crisis 
we have consistently and prudently invested in our hotels  positioning them to outperform in any part of the economic cycle 
additionally  our properties are primarily located in cities that have proven to be hour markets with high barriers to entry and multiple demand generators which outperform over the long term 
we have a balance sheet that will serve us well through this tough economic environment 
the company has taken the following steps to enhance the balance sheet  increase liquidity and reduce operating expenses to mitigate decreases in revenue reduced common dividend to one cent per quarter  expanded our senior unsecured credit facility from million to million  preserved capital by limiting capital investments at the hotels in to those related to life safety  emergency capital maintenance and a few minor projects that are currently underway  modified the fast track schedule for the ibm building conversion in chicago to a normal development schedule with major construction commencing at the appropriate time  coordinated with our hotel managers to significantly reduce management and hourly staffing levels at the hotel properties  and requested plans  procedures and triggering mechanisms from our hotel managers for monitoring of and further reductions in staffing levels and operating expenses 
for  the company had net income applicable to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share 
ffo was million  or per diluted share unit and ebitda was million 
revpar was 
we consider revpar and ebitda to be key measures of the performance of the individual hotels 
revpar for the total portfolio decreased for the revpar decrease is attributable to a decrease in average daily rate adr to and a decrease in occupancy to 
the company s hotel portfolio ebitda decreased to million 
hotel ebitda margin declines were limited to basis points due to proactive aggressive and effective efforts to reduce operating costs 
during  we completed the largest redevelopment and repositioning program in our company s history placing our hotels in excellent competitive condition 
with the economy weakening dramatically during the latter months of  we made significant cost reduction moves corporately and at our properties to position our properties for substantially lower demand in 
table of contents hotel operations depend on the state of the overall economy which can significantly impact hotel operational performance and thus  impact the company s financial position 
should any of the hotels experience a significant decline in operational performance  it may affect the company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders  service debt or meet other financial obligations 
the company measures hotel performance by evaluating financial metrics such as revpar  ffo and ebitda 
the company evaluates the hotels in its portfolio and potential acquisitions using the measures discussed above to determine each portfolio hotel s contribution or acquisition hotel s potential contribution toward reaching the company s goal of maintaining a reliable stream of income and moderate growth to shareholders 
the company invests in capital improvements throughout the portfolio to continue to increase the competitiveness of its hotels and improve their financial performance 
the company actively seeks to acquire new hotel properties that meet its investment criteria 
currently  due to the dislocation between buyers and sellers  the tight lending conditions  deteriorating operating fundamentals and lack of economic or industry clarity  it is difficult for the company to identify hotels to acquire that fit its stringent investment criteria at prices that are generally acceptable to sellers 
please refer to non gaap financial measures below for a detailed discussion of the company s use of ffo  ebitda and hotel ebitda and a reconciliation of ffo  ebitda and hotel ebitda to net income  a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap measurement 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the operating partnership  lhl and the company s other consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized the information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
for example  included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of million and no estimated valuation allowance on deferred tax asset as of december  management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize this deferred tax asset of million and has determined that no valuation allowance is required 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may determine these estimates differently  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses

for investments subject to ground leases  assets are depreciated over the shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the term of the ground lease 
renovations and or replacements that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
furniture  fixtures and equipment under capital leases are carried at the present value of the minimum lease payments 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives and classification of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation expense to reflect each year with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company change the expected useful life or classification of particular assets  it would result in a change in depreciation expense and annual net income 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of each hotel to determine if circumstances exist indicating impairment to the carrying value of the investment in the hotel or that depreciation periods should be modified 
if facts or circumstances support the possibility of impairment  the company will prepare an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  of the specific hotel and determine if the investment in such hotel is recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  an adjustment will be made to the carrying value of the hotel to reflect the hotel at fair value 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
the company does not believe that there are any facts or circumstances indicating impairment in the carrying value of any of its hotels

r  share based payment using the modified prospective transition method 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date  and  based on the requirements of sfas  for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
the company has not issued any share option awards since the company recognizes compensation cost for restricted shares issued based upon the fair market value of the common shares at the grant date  adjusted for forfeitures 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period

historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most real estate industry investors consider ffo and ebitda to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
the white paper on ffo approved by nareit in april defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and items classified by gaap as extraordinary  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred finance costs and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo consistent with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
with respect to ffo  the company believes that excluding the effect of extraordinary items  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits  even though ffo does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
however  ffo may not be helpful when comparing the company to non reits 
with respect to ebitda  the company believes that excluding the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are also based on historical cost accounting and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and amortization  and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  even though ebitda also does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 

table of contents with respect to hotel ebitda  the company believes that excluding the effect of corporate level expenses  non cash items  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control 
we believe property level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and effectiveness of the third party management companies operating our business on a property level basis 
neither ffo  ebitda nor hotel ebitda represents cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  cash flow from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
neither is ffo  ebitda or hotel ebitda a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is ffo  ebitda or hotel ebitda indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
neither measurement reflects cash expenditures for long term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred 
ffo  ebitda and hotel ebitda may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures  property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
to compensate for this  management considers the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or the evaluation of the company s operating performance

reserve funds certain of the company s agreements with its hotel managers  franchisors and lenders have provisions for the company to provide funds  generally to of hotel revenues  sufficient to cover the cost of a certain non routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels  and b replacements and renewals to the hotels furniture  fixtures and equipment 
certain agreements require that the company reserve cash 
as of december   the company held million of restricted cash reserves  million of which was available for future capital expenditures 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders  is the operating cash flow from hotels leased by lhl 
additional sources of cash are the company s senior unsecured credit facility  lhl s credit facility and secured financing on one or all of the company s nineteen unencumbered properties 
lhl is a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership 
payments to the operating partnership are required pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements between lhl and the operating partnership relating to the properties owned by the operating partnership and leased by lhl 
the lessee s obligations under the participating lease at le montrose suite hotel are unsecured and the lessee s ability to make rent payments to the operating partnership  and the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  are dependent on the lessee s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the hotel 

table of contents in addition  cash flow from hotel operations is subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include adverse effects of weak national  regional and local economic conditions  tightening credit standards  competition for guests and meetings from other hotels  including competition and pricing pressures from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs including wages  benefits  insurance  property taxes and energy due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increases in room rates  labor strikes  disruptions or lockouts that may impact operating performance  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares and other expenses related to travel  which may negatively affect traveling  and terrorism  terrorism alerts and warnings and military actions such as the engagement in iraq  pandemics or other medical events which may cause decreases in business and leisure travel 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of the hotel operators to generate revenues which could adversely affect the lessees of the company s hotels and their ability to make rental payments to the company pursuant to the participating leases and ultimately impact the company s liquidity 
the company s senior unsecured credit facility and lhl s credit facility contain certain financial covenants relating to debt service coverage  interest coverage  fixed charge coverage  net worth and total funded indebtedness and contains financial covenants that  assuming no defaults  allow the company to make shareholder distributions 
there are currently no other contractual or other arrangements limiting payment of distributions by the operating partnership 
failure to comply with our financial covenants contained in our credit facilities and non recourse secured mortgages could result from  among other things  changes in our results of operations  the incurrence of additional debt or changes in general economic conditions 
if we violate the financial covenants contained in either credit facility  we may attempt to negotiate a waiver of the violation or amend the terms of the credit facility with the lenders thereunder  however  we can make no assurance that we would be successful in any such negotiations or that  if successful in obtaining a waiver or amendment  such amendment or waiver would be on terms attractive to us 
if a default under any of the above debt instruments were to occur  we would possibly have to refinance the debt through additional debt financing  private or public offerings of debt securities  or additional equity financings 
if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms  including upon maturity of the debt  we may be forced to dispose of hotel properties on disadvantageous terms  potentially resulting in losses that reduce cash flow from operating activities 
if  at the time of any refinancing  prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  increases in interest expense would lower our cash flow  and  consequently  cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
as of december   the company is in compliance with all debt covenants  current on all loan payments and not otherwise in default under the credit facilities or mortgages

additionally  the company had million available under the senior unsecured credit facility and million available under the lhl credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  primarily due to the operations of hotels leased by lhl and participating lease revenues from hotels leased to third parties  which were offset by payments for real estate taxes  personal property taxes  insurance and ground rent 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  due to the purchase of the n 
wabash avenue property and outflows for improvements and additions at the hotels  partially offset by proceeds from restricted cash reserves

the company has considered its short term one year or less liquidity needs and the adequacy of its estimated cash flow from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
the company believes that its principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service requirements  distributions on the preferred shares and the minimum distribution required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the code 
the company anticipates that these needs will be met with cash flows provided by operating activities  borrowings under the senior unsecured credit facility and equity issuances available under the shelf registration statement 
the company also considers capital improvements and property acquisitions as short term needs that will be funded either with cash flows provided by operating activities  utilizing availability under the senior unsecured credit facility  the issuance of other indebtedness  or the issuance of additional equity securities 
the company expects to meet long term greater than one year liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other nonrecurring capital improvements utilizing availability under the senior unsecured credit facility  estimated cash flows from operations  the issuance of long term unsecured and secured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities 
the company expects to acquire or develop additional hotel properties only as suitable opportunities arise  and the company will not undertake acquisition or development of properties unless stringent acquisition development criteria have been achieved 
reserve funds the company is obligated to maintain reserve funds for capital expenditures at the hotels including the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment as determined pursuant to leases and operating agreements 
please refer to off balance sheet arrangements for a discussion of the reserve funds 
inflation the company s revenues come primarily from its pro rata share of the operating partnership s cash flow from the participating leases and the lhl hotel operating revenues  thus the company s revenues will vary based on changes in the underlying hotels revenues 
therefore  the company relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessees abilities to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
the hotel operators can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessees and hotel operators abilities to raise rates faster than inflation or even at the same rate 
the company s expenses primarily real estate taxes  property and casualty insurance  administrative expenses and lhl hotel operating expenses are subject to inflation 
these expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation  except for energy costs  property and casualty insurance  liability insurance  property tax rates  employee benefits  and some wages  which are expected to increase at rates higher than inflation  and except for instances in which the properties are subject to periodic real estate tax reassessments 
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effects of interest rate changes 
as of december   approximately of the company s borrowings were subject to variable rates 
the company limits the risks associated with interest rate changes by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives 
for interest rate exposures  derivatives are used primarily to align rate movements between interest rates associated with the company s hotel operating revenue  participating lease revenue and other financial assets with interest rates on related debt  and manage the cost of borrowing obligations 
the company may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
the company requires that hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge 
this effectiveness is essential in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
instruments that meet these hedging criteria are 
table of contents formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures 
the company did not utilize any derivative financial instruments during and there were no derivatives outstanding at december  the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
to manage interest rate risk  the company may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying exposure 
the company utilizes a variety of borrowings including lines of credit and medium and long term financings 
to reduce overall interest cost  the company uses interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts 
the resulting cost of funds is usually lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing as of each valuation date 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives and long term debt  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
item a

thereafter total fixed rate debt weighted average interest variable rate debt weighted average interest total the table above presents the principal amount of debt maturing each year  including annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
this table reflects indebtedness outstanding as of december  and does not reflect indebtedness  if any  incurred after that date 
the variable rate debt of  and  which mature in and  respectively may be extended to and  respectively 
the company s ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of adjustment  the ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate mortgage debt was 
table of contents the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company seeks to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring the company s variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
as of december   approximately million of the company s aggregate indebtedness of total indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates 
if market rates of interest on the company s variable rate long term debt fluctuate by  interest expense would increase or decrease  depending on rate movement  future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under the company s variable rate debt remains at million  the balance at december
