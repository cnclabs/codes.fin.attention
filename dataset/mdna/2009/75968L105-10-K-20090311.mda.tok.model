item a 
risk factors reliance on single product line 
our accelerated reader software and supplemental accelerated reader quizzes accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
an overall decline in sales of accelerated reader and supplemental quizzes would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
geographic concentration of sales 
a substantial portion of our sales is concentrated in several states  including california  texas  florida  georgia and north carolina  which accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of our net sales in if large numbers of schools or a district or districts controlling a large number of schools in such states were to discontinue purchasing our products and services  our business  financial condition  and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on educational institutions and government funding 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from sales to educational institutions  individual educators  and their other suppliers 
there can be no assurance that educational institutions and or individual educators will continue to invest in technology based products and professional development for reading and other curricula or continue to respond favorably to our marketing 
our inability to sustain the number of products sold or number of schools served would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of our dependence on educational institutions  the funding of which is largely dependent on government support  a substantial decrease in government budgets or funding for educational software or technology would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic slow downs such as the current one have the potential to negatively affect school funding and can therefore adversely impact the sale of our products and services to schools 
in addition  certain aspects of government sponsored education initiatives may not endorse  or be complementary to  the principles and methodologies underlying and associated with our products and services  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on continued product development 
the educational technology and services markets in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards  frequent product introductions and sudden technological change 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  on a number of factors  including our ability to enhance our existing products  develop and successfully introduce new products in a timely fashion  and respond quickly and cost effectively to technological change  including shifts in operating systems  hardware platforms  programming languages  alternative delivery systems  the internet and other uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that new products will be as well received as our established products  particularly since they may require technology and or resources not generally available in all schools 
we attempt to maintain high standards for the demonstrated academic effectiveness of our products 
our adherence to these standards could delay or inhibit the introduction of new products 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our products will not be rendered obsolete or that we will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments or be able to develop and market the products required to maintain our competitive position 
reliance on statistical studies to demonstrate effectiveness of our products and services 
we rely on statistical studies to demonstrate that our products and related services improve student achievement 
we believe that these studies accurately reflect the performance of our products 
these studies  however  involve the following risks i the sample sizes used in our studies may yield results that are not representative of the general population of students who use our products  ii the methods used to gather the information upon which these studies are based depend on cooperation from students and other participants  and inaccurate or incomplete responses could distort results  iii schools studying the effectiveness of our products may apply different methodologies and data collection techniques  making results difficult to aggregate and compare  iv we facilitate the collection and analysis of data for some of these studies  and v we hire researchers to aggregate and present the results of some of these studies and  in some cases  to conduct the studies 
there is growing demand from the no child left behind act and other sources for research and studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of educational programs and products 
our selling and marketing efforts  as well as our reputation  could be adversely impacted if the public  including our existing and potential customers  is not convinced that the product effectiveness is supported by the studies 
limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we regard certain of our technologies as proprietary and rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and employee non disclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
we also employ serialization techniques to prevent unauthorized installation of our software products and related content 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our rights will be adequate to prevent or deter misappropriation 
in addition  while we do not believe that our products  trademarks or other proprietary rights infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that a third party will not make a contrary assertion 
the cost of responding to such assertions can be material  regardless of whether an assertion is validated 
the software publishing industry has traditionally experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of products in violation of intellectual property rights 
such activity is difficult to detect and legal proceedings to enforce intellectual property rights are often burdensome and involve a high degree of uncertainty and costs 
there can be no assurance that our software products and the content will not experience unauthorized reproduction and distribution  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
selling and marketing strategy and product acceptance 
our selling and marketing strategy includes the introduction of new products and services directed at new markets as well as the development of new sales and distribution channels 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in offering new products and services  entering new markets and developing new sales and distribution channels or that any such products or services  if introduced  will achieve acceptance in the marketplace 
risks of international expansion 
a component of our growth strategy is the expansion of our operations in international markets 
doing business in international markets is subject to a number of risks  including  among others acceptance by foreign educational systems of our approach to educational products  lack of existing customer base  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  changing economic conditions  exposure to different legal standards particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if any of these risks were to materialize  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
educational philosophies 
our products support all teaching methods and curricula by focusing on continuous feedback  increased student practice of essential skills  and demonstrated product effectiveness through measurable results 
certain educators  academics  politicians  and theorists  however  advocate philosophies of instruction that can lead them to oppose certain educational products or services 
these philosophies can include  but are not limited to  opposition to standardized testing or over reliance on the same  opposition to computers or motivational techniques  narrow focus on particular types of direct instruction  and subjective opinions of what research supports product effectiveness 
these philosophical stances have the capacity to negatively influence the market for our products and services  and such influence could have a material adverse impact on demand for our products and services and thus on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
highly competitive industry 
the educational technology and professional development markets in which we operate are very competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other companies offering educational software products  computing devices  interactive response systems  professional development  and technology consulting services to schools 
education continues to emerge as a major global industry and potential competitors  including large hardware manufacturers  software developers  educational publishers  and consulting firms  may enter or increase their focus on the schools market  resulting in greater competition for us 
in addition  we compete against more traditional methods of education  training and testing  including pencil and paper testing 
as we enter into new markets  existing competitors could increase the barriers to entry by driving prices lower or making modifications to enhance their products 
success in selling our established products and services may cause competitors to focus on us in their marketing efforts thereby increasing direct competition 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to market our products successfully or compete effectively in the educational marketplace 
dependence on key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued active participation of certain key members of management 
we do not have employment agreements with these individuals and have no current intention of entering into any such employment agreements 
the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our continuing ability to retain the employees  including senior management personnel  who have assisted in the development and marketing of our products and to attract and retain qualified employees trained in computer technology  sales  marketing  finance  and other disciplines to enhance our product offerings and broaden our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
the failure to attract or retain the necessary personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly performance 
we generally deliver products as orders are received 
our reported revenue in any quarter can be affected by a variety of factors  including delays in the development and or shipment of new products  the closing of large contract sales  such as those to school districts  the shipment of new products for which orders have been building for a period of time  seasonal variations due to  among other things  the budget and school year cycles of our school customers and annual ordering patterns related to subscription based products and services  particularly accelerated reader enterprise and accelerated math enterprise  and seasonal variations due to delays in reading quiz and math library order patterns as customers consider upgrading to accelerated reader enterprise and accelerated math enterprise  which include access to all of our reading quizzes and math libraries 
in addition  our quarterly results can also be affected by charges related to acquisitions and divestitures  including related expenses  the write off of in process research and development  the amortization of intangible assets  asset impairments and similar items  charges related to obsolete or impaired tangible assets  intangible assets  goodwill  capitalized software development costs and similar items  supply chain issues such as manufacturing problems  delivery delays  component shortages  strikes or quality issues  expenses related to product development and marketing initiatives  and seasonal variability of product support costs 
our overall gross margins also fluctuate based upon the mix of software  hardware and service sales 
we realize higher margins on our software product sales than our hardware and service sales 
some of our revenues tend to be seasonal due to annual school budget cycles  customer preferences as to when products and services are delivered and the timing of our larger professional development events  resulting in seasonal variations in margins 
share price volatility 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
these factors include announcements of technological innovations and or new products by us and our competitors  earnings releases and other announcements by us and our competitors  expectations regarding government funding levels for education  market conditions in the industry  announcements by us of significant acquisitions and or divestitures  and the general state of the securities markets 
the market price of our common stock may decline significantly if we fail to meet our forecasts or the published earnings estimates of analysts and others 
in addition  quarterly fluctuations of our results of operations as described above may cause a significant variation in the market price of our common stock 
war  acts of war and terrorism 
delays and reductions in purchases of our products and services may occur as a result of war  acts of war and terrorism  and the related impacts  including a reduction of funds available to our customers to purchase our products and services and disruptions in our ability to develop  produce and distribute products and services to our customers 
these events would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentration of share ownership  control by principal shareholders management 
as of february   our principal shareholders  judith paul and terrance paul  our chairman and chief executive officer  respectively  and co founders of the company  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these principal shareholders have the ability to control and direct our business and affairs 
shares eligible for future sale 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
as of february   approximately million shares of our common stock were held by affiliates and may be publicly sold only if registered under the securities act of or sold in accordance with an applicable exemption from registration  such as rule in addition  we have filed registration statements under the securities act of to register an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our stock incentive plan and an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan espp  which will  when issued in accordance with such plans  be eligible for immediate sale in the public market  subject to the rule resale limitations for affiliates 
we did not offer the espp to our employees in  or and have no intention of offering it in cash dividends 
we declared quarterly cash dividends of per share for each of the four quarters of we also declared a special dividend of per share during our dividend policy may be affected by  among other things  our views on potential future capital requirements  including those related to research and development  creation and expansion of sales distribution channels  acquisitions  legal risks and stock repurchases 
our dividend policy may change from time to time  and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts 
a change in our dividend policy could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
possible antitakeover effects of certain articles and by laws provisions and provisions of wisconsin law 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  along with wisconsin statutory law  contain provisions that could discourage potential acquisition proposals and might delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
such provisions could result in our being less attractive to a potential acquirer and could result in the shareholders receiving less for their common stock than otherwise might be available in the event of a takeover attempt 
divestitures 
from time to time  we may  for any number of reasons  determine it is in our best interests and in the interests of our shareholders to discontinue or dispose of a business or product line 
divestitures involve a number of difficulties and risks  including  among others  the diversion of management time and resources and the resulting disruption to our ongoing business  and unanticipated costs and liabilities 
if we are unable to manage the divestiture process successfully or if we are incorrect in our assumptions regarding the costs associated with a disposition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
acquisitions 
we evaluate strategic opportunities from time to time  including acquisitions 
acquisitions involve a number of difficulties and risks  including  among others the failure to integrate personnel  technology  research and development  marketing and sales operations of the acquired company  the diversion of management time and resources and the resulting disruption to our ongoing business  the potential loss of the acquired company s customers  as well as our own  and unanticipated costs and liabilities 
integration processes require significant time and resources  and we may not be able to manage the process successfully 
if customers of the acquired company  or our customers  are uncertain about our ability to operate on a combined basis with the acquired company  they could delay or cancel orders for products and services 
moreover  we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction 
if we fail to integrate an acquired company or business successfully  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected  including the potential need to record a non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles

our sales are derived primarily from the sale of software products  computerized hardware products and related services 
revenues are recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
allowances for bad debts are also recorded at the time of the sale 
product revenue is derived primarily from the sale of educational software and hardware 
revenue from sales of hardware is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue recognition from sales of our software depends on whether the software is i off the shelf or customized and ii whether it is licensed on a perpetual basis or as a subscription 
we recognize revenue from off the shelf perpetually licensed software sales upon delivery to customers 
subscription based software sales are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
sales of software that require substantial modification or customization are recognized as revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues and deferred revenues from software that require substantial modification or customization are not significant in any of the years presented 
service revenue is derived primarily from i product support services  ii professional development and product training seminars and conferences  iii application hosting  iv technical services  v consulting and vi other remote services 
product support services included with sales of perpetually licensed software have a duration of months or less and the associated revenue is recognized at the time the software is shipped with the related costs of providing the telephone support accrued for at the same time 
revenue from professional development and product training seminars and conferences is recognized when the seminar or conference is held 
revenue from other product support services and application hosting is initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  typically months 
revenue from technical services  consulting and other remote services is recognized as the services are performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period 
deferred revenue includes i amounts invoiced for products not yet delivered and services not yet performed  ii advance invoicing on contracts and iii that portion of product support agreements and subscription based product sales that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
it is our practice to announce new products prior to when the products are ready for shipment to allow customers sufficient lead time for budgeting and curriculum purposes 
this practice can result in fluctuations in backlog for orders of new products 
these orders are generally filled within a relatively short period of time after the product is ready for shipment 
registrations for seminars and conferences are generally received from customers in advance of the events  resulting in a backlog for these services 
additionally  under district wide implementations  customers commit to a comprehensive solution consisting of products and services in advance of delivery of the products and services 
the delivery of backlogged products and services in certain periods can cause those periods to have higher revenue and higher revenue growth rates than other periods 
cost of sales consists of expenses associated with sales of our software and hardware products and the delivery of services 
these costs include i personnel related costs  ii costs of purchased materials such as our neo laptops  optical mark card scanners  know response systems  educational products  training materials  manuals and  motivational items  iii shipping and freight costs  iv amortization of capitalized development costs and  v other overhead costs 
we realize higher gross profit margins on our software sales than on our hardware and service sales 
we expense all development costs associated with a software product until technological feasibility is established  after which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized product development costs are amortized into cost of sales  beginning when the product is available for general release  using the straight line method over their estimated economic life  which is generally estimated to be months 
results of operations our results of operations can be affected by many factors including the general economic environment  state and federal budgetary decisions and  the length and complexity of the sales cycle for school districts 
national trends  federal and state legislation  department of education policies and  the way the foregoing align with our products and services can impact our business 
an important component of our software product strategy is a transition to a subscription based software sales model 
we believe that a business model based on subscription based software offers long term advantages over traditional perpetual licensing  including i improved product utilization leading to higher levels of customer satisfaction  ii product adoption by more schools  iii more lifetime revenue per customer and  iv a more predictable and reliable revenue stream 
we believe the percentage of customers using the subscription based enterprise version of our reading and math products is an important indicator of i the progress of this strategic growth initiative  ii the magnitude of the growth opportunities still existing with regard to this strategy and  iii the impact of the new seasonal patterns on our business 
as of the end of  approximately of our active reading product customers were using the enterprise version 
worldwide  we currently have approximately  active accelerated reader customers   active accelerated math customers and   active star reading and star math customers 
customer counts have been adjusted from those previously reported as we refined our counting process with respect to various factors  including the definition of an active customer school  how we count schools involved in a district implementation and  how to handle transfers of products and subscriptions between schools 
the transition to subscription based products affects customer ordering patterns 
compared to orders for non subscription based offerings  customer orders of our subscription based offerings tend to more closely follow school budgeting patterns resulting in a more seasonal order pattern weighted to the second and third calendar quarters 
also  after customers transition to our subscription based enterprise products  they no longer order reading quizzes and math libraries since access to this content is included in their subscription 
historically  our customers have ordered more of this content in the first and fourth quarters 
the combined effect is that a much greater proportion of a year s orders is expected in the second quarter and to an even greater extent in the third quarter than we have experienced historically 
transitioning to subscription based software can also adversely impact orders for expansions  add on reading quizzes and math libraries by customers who own our software under perpetual license agreements  as they may delay purchases of expansions  reading quizzes and math libraries while they are contemplating a transition to subscription based versions of our products 
this transition can also significantly affect reported financial results 
since our renaissance place product and service offerings are typically sold on a subscription basis with a term of months  a large portion of our revenue is initially deferred and recognized into income over the subscription period 
driven primarily by sales of our subscription based enterprise software packages  deferred revenue increased million and million  over the years ended december  and  respectively 
this timing difference between receipt of an order and revenue recognition  on subscription based products and services  can result in reported revenue being significantly lower or significantly higher than the amount of orders received in any given period and can also affect comparative results from one period to another 
additionally  our renaissance place products are often sold at the school district level and district level sales are more complex  have a longer sales cycle  and are typically for a larger dollar amount than sales made to individual schools 
revenues from district sales are therefore more uneven and more difficult to accurately predict than individual school level sales 
consequently  our revenues and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the timing of large district orders 
large infrequent charges are another factor that can significantly affect our results of operations 
in we recorded i a non cash  non recurring charge of million after tax for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition of alphasmart  ii a charge of million related to a lawsuit regarding defective parts from a supplier for which we received an unfavorable court decision and  iii a million charge to terminate contracts for professional development events where we altered the timing or location of those events 
in we took a charge of million to reorganize our product development resources  reducing staff and assets related to the laptop line 
our net income and results of operations was impacted by a charge of million in separation expense  primarily for former executives 
the following table sets forth certain consolidated income statement data as a percentage of net sales  except that individual components of cost of sales and gross profit are shown as a percentage of their corresponding component of net sales net sales products services total net sales cost of sales products services total cost of sales gross profit products services total gross profit operating expenses product development selling and marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill intangible assets operating income loss other  net income loss before taxes income tax provision net income loss years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in revenue in increased primarily due to recognition of deferred revenue from orders received in earlier periods and to a lesser extent by increased orders for our products and services received in the current year 
customer orders for our products and services increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to during  deferred revenue increased by million as compared to an increase of million in product revenue decreased by million  or  to million in  essentially unchanged from million in service revenue increased by million  or  to million in from million in nearly all service categories achieved growth  with the largest increases in our remote technical services  primarily hosting and installations 
service revenues also increased because we held a national conference in the first quarter of  but did not hold a national conference in cost of sales 
the cost of sales of products decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales of products decreased to in from in primarily due to lower manufacturing costs of our scanner and a product mix shift in the laptop line to the more profitable neos 
the cost of sales of services increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales of services  the cost of sales of services decreased to in from in the improvement resulted from growth of our more profitable technical service offerings  especially hosting  and increased utilization of our fixed costs during our overall gross profit margin percentage increased to in from in the improvement is attributable to the increased profitability on products and services explained above  tempered by an overall revenue mix weighted more heavily towards services in product development 
product development expense  which excludes amounts capitalized  decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  product development expenses decreased to in from in the reduction in product development expenses is primarily due to i a charge of million in to reorganize our product development resources  reducing staff and assets related to the laptop line  ii ongoing savings from the restructuring in and  iii research costs incurred in related to the expansion of the united kingdom product offerings 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in selling and marketing expenses increased in  partly due to increased commissions as a result of higher customer order levels and  higher promotional expenses related to the neo  partially offset by lower spending on advertising and direct marketing 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were in compared to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to a charge of million related to a lawsuit regarding defective parts from a supplier for which we received an unfavorable court decision and  a million charge to terminate contracts for professional development events where we altered the timing or location of those events  partially offset by other cost reductions 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative costs decreased to in from in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in we recorded the following pretax impairment charges related to the acquisition of alphasmart i million of goodwill  ii million for the alphasmart trademark and  iii million for the customer relationships 
the overall current economic climate  the more discretionary nature of school purchases of the laptop products and  recent sales performance of this product line have caused us to lower our growth expectations  which in turn resulted in a lower valuation of this product line and  consequently  the aforementioned impairment charges 
operating income 
an operating loss of million occurred in compared to operating income of million in the operating loss was primarily a result of the alphasmart impairment charges which were partially offset by earnings from ongoing operations 
the impairment charges negatively impacted operating income by million and net income after tax by million 
other income 
other income  which is mainly interest income from our investment securities  decreased to million in from million in due to somewhat lower average cash balances in and to lower market rates of return on fixed income investments 
income tax provision 
in the annual effective rate of our provision for income taxes was 
our annual effective income tax rate  excluding the tax effect of the impairment charge to goodwill and other intangibles  was in since the write down of the alphasmart goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes it does not generate a current tax benefit  resulting in tax expense of million during in spite of the reported pre tax loss 
the tax accounting treatment of the goodwill write down is the primary reason in for the difference between the rate and the actual rate of reflected in the financial statements 
this compares to income tax expense of million that was recorded in at an effective income tax rate of of pre tax income 
years ended december  and net sales 
our net sales decreased by million  or  to million in from million in a significant portion of this decline was related to our customers purchasing more subscription based products and services  particularly accelerated reader 
revenues from subscription based products are initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the subscription period  generally one year  while the majority of revenues from non subscription based sales are recognized immediately upon delivery 
during  deferred revenue increased by million as compared to an increase of million in customer orders for our products and services increased by approximately million  or  in as compared to product revenue decreased by million  or  to million in from million in product revenues decreased primarily due to the significant increase in deferred revenue and to a lesser extent due to lower laptop sales 
service revenue increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in service revenues increased primarily due to order improvements for technical services such as application hosting and installations  and in professional development services  both remote and onsite  partially offset by the impact of not holding a national conference in cost of sales 
the cost of sales of products decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales of products was in  relatively unchanged from in the cost of sales of services increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales of services  the cost of sales of services increased to in from in primarily due to personnel and infrastructure additions that were required for some of our remote and technical services  and to price reductions in some of our on site professional development service offerings 
our overall gross profit margin percentage decreased to in from in this resulted from the lower service margins and the higher proportion of total revenue attributable to services in product development 
product development expense  which excludes amounts capitalized  increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  product development expenses increased to in from in we capitalized product development expenses of million in compared to million in product development expenses were higher in primarily due to i a million restructuring cost related to a partial reorganization of product development resources for the laptop line in  ii the higher level of software development cost capitalized in than in and  iii a million increase in research and development costs related to our united kingdom products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in selling and marketing expenses increased in  partly due to increased commissions as a result of higher customer order levels and partly due to salaries as a result of our sales force expansion  partially offset by lower spending on advertising and direct marketing 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were in compared to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were lower in primarily due to the impact of an executive severance charge of million taken in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to in from in due to the combined effect of the factors discussed above 
other income 
other income  which is mainly interest income from our investment securities  was million in  unchanged from income tax provision 
income tax expense of million  from continuing operations  was recorded in at an effective income tax rate of of pre tax income  compared to million  or  of pre tax income for the higher tax rate in was primarily the result of the adoption of the new accounting standard for uncertain tax positions  financial interpretation no 
fin 
the method for estimating  accruing and recognizing expenses and benefits of uncertain income tax positions under fin is substantially different than under the previous accounting standard 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities were million  down million from million at december  during  we generated operating cash flow of million 
as of december  we have a million secured revolving line of credit with a bank which is available until july  the line of credit bears interest at either a floating rate or a fixed rate for a period of up to days based on libor plus 
the rate is at our option and is determined at the time of borrowing 
we also have a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank available until april  which bears interest at the prime rate less 
as of december   the lines of credit had not been used 
on april   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock  on february   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares  and on february   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares under the stock repurchase program 
no time limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
repurchased shares will become treasury shares and will be used for stock based employee benefit plans  equity compensation plans and  for other general corporate purposes 
from january  through december   we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of million 
since the original authorization of the repurchase program in  we have repurchased approximately million shares at a cost of million 
depending on our stock valuation  cash availability and other factors  we may repurchase additional shares as a beneficial use of our cash to enhance shareholder value 
we declared quarterly cash dividends of per share in the first and second quarter of and in the third and fourth quarter of along with a special dividend of per share in the third quarter of we declared quarterly cash dividends of per share in each of the four quarters of along with a special dividend of per share in the fourth quarter of we intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends  subject to capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in the best interests of the company and our shareholders 
our board of directors also considers several additional factors when declaring dividends  including the company s financial statements as of the most recent practicable date  the expected cash costs to deliver the products and services recorded as deferred revenue  the company s ability to provide the products and services underlying amounts recorded as deferred revenue  the likelihood of recognizing amounts recorded as deferred revenue as net sales based on the company s historical experience and most recent projections and the short time period over which such recognition has historically occurred and is expected to occur and  other information  opinions  reports and statements prepared and presented by the company s officers and employees about the company s business  operations and financial condition 
we believe our strong cash position coupled with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet both our short term and long term working capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations including contingent obligations  that would have a material effect on our financial results 
operating leases 
we enter into operating leases  primarily for facilities that we occupy in order to carry out our business operations 
we utilize operating leases for some of our facilities to gain flexibility as compared to purchasing facilities outright and limit our exposure to many of the risks of owning commercial property  particularly with regard to international operations 
these agreements are generally for terms of one to five years 
some of the leases have early termination clauses  but they generally cannot be terminated by either the lessor or us for reasons other than breach of the lease agreement 
we plan to terminate the lease on a small office facility in early for which we have a day no penalty option to terminate 
we do not anticipate the early termination of any other lease agreements 
for each of the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  related to these operating leases 
purchase obligations 
we enter into commitments with certain suppliers to purchase components for our hardware products  such as alphasmart computing devices  accelscan scanners and the know response system 
the majority of these obligations will be satisfied within one year 
tax audit settlements and deposits 
currently we do not anticipate making any significant cash payments related to the settlement of tax audits or deposits for unsettled audit issues 
estimation of the amounts and timing of payments in periods after are highly uncertain and therefore are not included in the table 
as of december   our approximate contractual obligations for operating leases  tax audit payments and purchase obligations by period due were as follows contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations tax audit related payments purchase obligations total supplemental executive retirement plan 
we have established a supplemental executive retirement plan serp for the provision of retirement benefits to members of senior management 
under the terms of the plan  participants elect to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and invest their deferrals in certain mutual funds which are nearly identical to the investment selections offered to participants in our k retirement plan 
upon a serp participant s retirement or certain other events  we have an obligation to repay the current market value of the participant s account balance 
as of december   we have fully funded the million aggregate contractual obligation for future payments to serp participants 
payouts of our obligations related to the serp are dependent on when participants leave service and how they elect to receive their accrued benefit payments  which can range from a single lump sum payment to a year series of payments 
due to the inherent uncertainties in predicting when the serp obligations will be repaid  they are not included in the above table 
the serp is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other obligations 
as of december   we did not hold any long term debt obligations  long term purchase obligations or material capital lease obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a list of our critical accounting policies defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
this is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from our software products in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants 
under this accounting standard  revenue is recognized when the following have occurred persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or a service has been performed  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue is recognized as follows i at the time of shipment to customers for perpetually licensed off the shelf software products and related telephone support with a duration of months or less sold with the product  ii on the percentage of completion basis for software products which require significant customization or modification  iii as seminars are performed for training and professional development services  iv straight line over the term of the support agreement for other software support agreements  v as the service is performed or on a straight line basis over the contractual period for application hosting  technical and consulting services and  vi straight line over the subscription period for subscription based products and services 
accordingly  management is required to make judgments as to the fair value of the elements of a software arrangement  whether pricing is fixed and determinable  whether collectibility is reasonably assured and  what the percentage of completion is as of the financial reporting date 
expenses are recognized and matched against revenues for the reporting period presented in the financial statements 
we record accruals for sales returns and doubtful accounts at the time of revenue recognition based upon historical experience as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to cause sales returns or doubtful accounts to differ from historical experience 
changes in such allowances may be required if future returns or bad debt activity differs from our estimates 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we assess the value of our goodwill on at least an annual basis by comparing its fair value with its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation analysis performed by management using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made regarding future cash flows 
our estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as overall economic conditions  competitive forces  customer behavior  product acceptance  specific industry factors  and changes in interest rates 
in and  our laptop revenues decreased due in part to difficulties in integrating the selling operations of alphasmart into our overall organization 
early results in were encouraging  but the worsening economic climate resulted in schools and districts becoming very cautious with their spending  causing laptop orders to decline sharply in the fourth quarter of laptops are generally viewed as a more discretionary purchase in times of tight school budgets and curtailed spending 
as we believe the economic problems could be relatively prolonged  we lowered our forecast for orders of laptops and writing software  which resulted in impairment charges related to the alphasmart acquisition as follows i goodwill of million  ii trademark of million and  iii customer relationships of million 
software support and product warranty obligations 
we record a liability for the estimated cost of software support and hardware warranties at the time of sale 
estimated costs are based upon our historical cost experience of fulfilling these obligations as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to affect those costs  such as trends in the cost of providing telephone support and product return rates 
if the actual costs of fulfilling these obligations differ from our estimates  it could result in additional charges to cost of sales in future periods 
software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is achieved 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis using the straight line method over their estimated economic life  which is generally estimated to be months 
amortization begins when the products are available for general release to customers 
if the actual economic life of our products is shorter than our estimates  it could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
taxes 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate the effective income tax rate anticipated to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective income tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states  the estimated amount of certain tax credits  as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual distribution of taxable income by jurisdiction varies from our expectations  if the actual amount of tax credits varies from our estimates  or if the results of tax planning strategies are different from our estimates  adjustments to the effective income tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
we record a liability for uncertain tax positions based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  there is significant inherent uncertainty in these estimates 
actual payments or assessments may differ from our estimates and require tax provision adjustments in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r business combination sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for us on january  the impact of sfas r on our future consolidated financial statements will depend on the size and nature of future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
this new consolidation method will significantly change the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders 
sfas is effective for us on january  sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas 
this standard permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the provisions of sfas were effective for us on january  we did not elect the fair value option and therefore sfas had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements  sfas  to establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosures on fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas were effective for us on january  the adoption of sfas had no impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the adoption did result in additional disclosures as set forth in note r of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market interest rate risk consists of i the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and ii the decrease or increase in value of our investment security portfolio if market interest rates increase or decrease  respectively 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient liquidity to hold our investments to maturity  therefore  we do not expect to recognize any material losses or gains related to an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
market risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to the quality of the holdings in our investment security portfolio 
the fair market value of our investments is subject to increases or decreases in value resulting from the performance of the securities issuer  from upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness of the securities issuer  upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness of the insurer of the securities and  from changes in general market conditions 
we seek to manage our exposure to market risk by investing in accordance with our corporate investment policy as established by our board of directors 
the goals of the policy are i preservation of capital  ii provision of adequate liquidity to meet projected cash requirements  iii minimization of risk of principal loss through diversification and  iv maximization of yields in relationship to the guidelines  risk  market conditions and tax considerations 
our investment policy permits investments in obligations of the us treasury department and its agencies  money market funds and  high quality investment grade corporate and municipal interest bearing obligations 
the policy requires diversification to prevent excess concentration of issuer risk and requires the maintenance of minimum liquidity levels 
the policy precludes investment in equity securities except for the specific purpose of funding the obligations related to our supplemental executive retirement plan see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   our investment securities had a market value of approximately million and a carrying value of million 
due to the type and duration of our investments  we do not expect to realize any material gains or losses related to market risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency 
revenues and expenses of such subsidiaries have been translated into us dollars using average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
assets and liabilities have been translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date 
we use the historical exchange rates published by the oanda corporation for these translations 
translation gains or losses are deferred as a separate component of shareholders equity 
aggregate foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net income 
as such  our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to the british pound  canadian dollar  euro and indian rupee 
at this time  foreign exchange rate risk is not significant due to the relative size of our foreign operations and revenues derived from sales in foreign currency
