item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein 
the company is a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit which owns  operates  and develops manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern  southern  and southeastern united states 
as of december   the company owned and operated a portfolio of developed properties located in states  including manufactured housing communities  recreational vehicle communities  and properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites 
since the year  the operations of manufactured homebuilders  dealers  and the companies that finance the purchase of the homes have experienced severe losses and substantial volatility 
new home shipments have declined from approximately  in to approximately  in the decline was largely due to the turmoil in the financing side of the industry as lenders experienced substantial losses arising from defaults on poorly underwritten loans in the mid to late s and beyond 
as a result of the losses  the lenders experienced liquidity constraints and significantly tightened underwriting standards  thus reducing the demand for new homes 
the company experienced a decline of occupancy from in to at december  this pattern of loss has significantly slowed in recent years as occupancy was at the end of in addition to the conditions described above  this occupancy decline is also attributable to the attraction of our traditional customer base to single family homes due to the substantial easing of underwriting qualifications for applicants which abruptly ended in a national survey of major markets and over  sites noted an average occupancy of  only slightly above that of the company 
from that it would appear that the company s geographic distribution results in an occupancy little different from that determined by a national survey 
the company s primary product is to supply affordable housing to the marketplace 
homes are available for rent or purchase 
monthly cost per square foot ranges from to 
this represents  at the low end  a  square foot home sited on a  to  foot site and includes the home and the site rent 
the company s communities currently have over  resident owners of their homes and over  resident renters 
there are nearly  homes in inventory available to rent 
the company also has over  vacant sites available for occupancy 
the difficult economy will cause some loss of occupancy due to unemployment  but it will also return our traditional customer as well as others who must seek economical housing options of which the company have a substantial supply 
the company also sells homes 
these homes can be purchased by customers from our inventory of new and preowned product or through custom orders submitted to manufacturers 
the company offers excellent value on these sales as there are approximately  homes available for sale which were and still are being purchased from lenders at deeply discounted prices 
home sales grew from in to in and are expected to grow again in the company s sales expect to benefit from the tax credit available to qualifying homebuyers as well as from marketing initiatives which are regularly being developed 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimate and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets and investment in affiliates rental property is recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is recognized when a long lived asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of long lived assets was calculated based on discounted future cash flows associated with the asset and any potential disposition proceeds for a given asset 
forecasting cash flows requires assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period  rental rates  occupancy and operating expenses during the holding period  as well as disposition proceeds 
management determined certain impairment reviews were required as of december   as decisions were made to limit development of certain assets 
due to local economic conditions  estimated costs to develop and low estimated return on investment the company determined to limit development in three development communities 
the properties are located in michigan  nevada and north carolina 
each had considerable up front development costs 
a fourth property  located in indiana  was found to be impaired based on its negative cash flows and management s estimate of continued negative cash flows 
the company also made a decision to stop providing cable television service at various communities as the business line could not provide the return on investment to justify the capital investment required to keep up with the technological advances in the offered product 
as a result of the impairment analysis  the company recognized non cash impairment charges of million 
the company owns an approximate percent investment in an affiliate that is reported under the equity method of accounting 
management performs an analysis to determine if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
numerous factors are evaluated in accordance with published gaap and sec staff guidance 
changes in the facts and circumstances evaluated  future adverse changes in market conditions or operating results of the affiliate may affect management s analysis 
notes and accounts receivable the company evaluates the recoverability of its receivables whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan and lease agreements 
receivables related to community rents are reserved when the company believes that collection is less than probable  which is generally after a resident balance reaches to days past due 
the company reserves for estimated repairs to homes which collateralize its installment notes receivable based upon an estimate of annual foreclosures and historical costs of repair in excess of the anticipated sales price 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are years for land improvements and buildings  years for rental homes  to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment  and years for intangible assets 
revenue recognition rental income attributable to site and home leases is recorded on a straight line basis when earned from tenants 
leases entered into by tenants generally range from month to month to two years and are renewable by mutual agreement of the company and the resident or  in some cases  as provided by state statute 
revenue from the sale of manufactured homes is recognized upon transfer of title at the closing of the sales transaction 
interest income on notes receivable is recorded on a level yield basis over the life of the notes 
capitalized costs the company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with the development  redevelopment  capital enhancement and leasing of its properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
the amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred 
renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete 
costs incurred to renovate repossessed homes for the company s rental program are capitalized and costs incurred to refurbish the homes at turnover and repair the homes while occupied are expensed 
certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period based on the anticipated term of occupancy of a resident 
costs associated with implementing the company s computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware 
derivative instruments and hedging activities at december   the company had two interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap agreement to offset interest rate risk 
the company entered into two additional swap agreements in late december and february which become effective on january  and february   respectively 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the company adjusts its balance sheet on a quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of its derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged 
the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings over time and occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings 
the company uses standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized 
income taxes the company has elected to be taxed as a reit as defined under section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in order for the company to qualify as a reit  at least ninety five percent of the company s gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
as a reit  the company generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent of its reit ordinary taxable income to its stockholders  which it fully intends to do 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the company will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
the company remains subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income 
the company is subject to certain state taxes that are considered income taxes and has certain subsidiaries that are taxed as regular corporations 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements and net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is established if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards adopted in the year ended december  did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
accounting standards to be adopted after the year ended december  that may or will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition are discussed below in december the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb sfas  which amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to establish new standards that will govern the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries 
also  sfas requires that noncontrolling interest  previously referred to as minority interest  be reported as part of equity in the consolidated financial statements  losses be allocated to the noncontrolling interest even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance  reducing the losses attributed to the controlling interest  changes in ownership interests be treated as equity transactions if control is maintained  upon a loss of control  any gain or loss on the interest sold be recognized in earnings  and the noncontrolling interest s share be recorded at the fair value of net assets acquired  plus its share of goodwill 
sfas is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will be applied retrospectively 
the company expects the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the presentation of minority interest 
in may the fasb ratified fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb  which requires issuers of convertible debt securities within its scope to separate these securities into a debt component and an equity component  resulting in the debt component being recorded at fair value without consideration given to the conversion feature 
issuance costs are also allocated between the debt and equity components 
fsp apb will require that convertible debt within its scope reflect a company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest expense is recognized 
fsp apb is effective fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively to all prior periods 
the company is evaluating the impact fsp no 
apb will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
supplemental measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we have provided information regarding net operating income noi in the following tables 
noi is derived from revenues determined in accordance with gaap minus property operating expenses and real estate taxes determined in accordance with gaap 
we use noi as the primary basis to evaluate the performance of our operations 
a reconciliation of noi to net loss is included in results of operations below 
the company believes that noi is helpful to investors and analysts as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment  and provides a method of comparing property performance over time 
the company uses noi as a key management tool when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and or groups of properties 
the principal limitation of noi is that it excludes depreciation  amortization  interest expense  and non property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses  all of which are significant costs  and therefore  noi is a measure of the operating performance of the properties of the company rather than of the company overall 
the company believes that these costs included in net income loss often have no effect on the market value of a property and therefore limit its use as a performance measure 
in addition  such expenses are often incurred at a parent company level and therefore are not necessarily linked to the performance of a real estate asset 
noi should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our financial performance  or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
noi  as determined and presented by the company  may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the company also provides information regarding funds from operations ffo 
a definition of ffo and a reconciliation of net loss to ffo are included in the presentation of ffo in results of operations following the comparison of the years ended december  and results of operations the company reports operating results under two segments real property operations  and home sales and rentals 
the real property operations segment owns  operates  and develops manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern  southern  and southeastern united states and is in the business of acquiring  operating and expanding manufactured housing communities 
the home sales and rentals segment offers manufactured home sales and leasing services to tenants and prospective tenants of our communities 
the company evaluates segment operating performance based on noi 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements  except for the use of noi 
the company may allocate certain common costs  primarily corporate functions  between the segments differently than the company would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
these allocated costs include expenses for shared services such as information technology  finance  communications  legal and human resources 
the company does not allocate interest expense and certain other corporate costs not directly associated with the segments noi

occupancy and weighted average rent relates only to manufactured housing sites  and excludes permanent and seasonal recreational vehicle sites 
in the past few years there have been signs of recovery in our industry  such as lower repossessions 
in the earlier part of the decade this industry has faced challenging times due to poor lending practices of the manufactured home lenders from the s  coupled with reduced new home shipments  and the non existence of a dealer network 
the company has continued to show positive growth year over year in real property net operating income 
noi increased by million from million to million  or percent 
management believes while not recession proof  our resistance to recessionary forces is derived from our industry providing affordable housing in the face of economic crisis 
the growth in income from real property of million is due to a weighted average rental rate increase of percent that resulted in increased manufactured home rental income net of vacancies and rent discounts of million  increased income from our recreational vehicle portfolio of million and increased miscellaneous other property revenues of million 
the million increase in miscellaneous other property revenues can be primarily attributed to revenues from rubbish collection  water and sewer re billing  late fees and returned check fees 
the growth in real property operating expenses of million was due to several factors 
payroll and benefit costs increased by million due to the company s annual merit wage increase and associated payroll taxes  and increased health insurance costs 
utility costs related to water and rubbish removal charges increased million both of which are re billed to the resident and correspondingly increased income from real property as mentioned above 
supply and repair costs related to community maintenance increased by million 
legal fees related to delinquency and other property matters decreased by million 
property and casualty insurance decreased by million due to a decrease in reserves for current claims and favorable settlement of prior claims 
this benefit was completely offset by increased other expenses related to administrative costs such as postage  advertising  etc 
of million 
real estate taxes decreased by million due to an adjustment to accrued real estate taxes due to refunds of tax appeals  principally in the states of michigan and texas 
real property operations same site the following table reflects certain financial and statistical information for particular properties owned and operated for the same period in both years for the years ended december  and a key management tool the company uses when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties is a comparison of same site communities 
the same site data may change from time to time depending on acquisitions  dispositions  management discretion  significant transactions  or unique situations

occupied sites include manufactured housing and permanent recreational vehicle sites  and exclude seasonal recreational vehicle sites 
occupancy and weighted average rent relates only to manufactured housing sites  and excludes permanent and seasonal recreational vehicle sites 
as indicated above this is an analytical measure used by management to determine the growth of our communities on a year over year basis that may have items classified differently than our gaap statements 
the primary differences between our total portfolio and same site portfolio are the reclassification of water and sewer expense from utilities to income from real property to reflect the recovery net of expenses and the inclusion of  rather than  properties in the same site portfolio 
home sales and rentals as discussed in the overview in management s discussion and analysis  the company acquires repossessed manufactured homes generally  that are within its communities from lenders at substantial discounts 
the company leases or sells these value priced homes to current and prospective residents 
the company also purchases new homes to lease and sell to current and prospective residents 
the programs the company has established for its customers to lease or buy new and used homes have helped to prevent additional occupancy loss and have contributed to the company s continued noi growth even during turbulent industry and economic conditions 
the following table reflects certain financial and statistical information for the company s rental program for the years ended december  and years ended december  change change financial information in thousands  except for rental home revenue site rent from rental program rental program revenue expenses payroll and commissions repairs and refurbishment taxes and insurance marketing and other rental program operating and maintenance net operating income statistical information number of occupied rentals  end of period investment in occupied rental homes number of sold rental homes weighted average monthly rental rate the renter s monthly payment includes the site rent and an amount attributable to the leasing of the home 
the site rent is reflected in the real property operations segment 
for purposes of management analysis  the site rent is included in the rental program revenue to evaluate the growth and performance of the rental program 
net operating income from the rental program increased million from million to million  or percent as a result of a million increase in revenue partially offset by a million increase in expenses 
revenues increased due to the increase in the number of leased homes in the company s rental program and due to the increase in average rental rates as indicated in the table above 
certain expenses increase as the number of homes in the rental program increase 
these expenses include personal property tax  use tax  repair costs  and refurbishment costs 
although total refurbishment costs increased by million  the average refurbishment cost per move out costs incurred to prepare a previously leased home for a new occupant declined percent from  in to  in commissions decreased by million due to a realignment of the commission plan that prorates the commission if the full lease term was not completed 
marketing and other costs increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotion costs of million and an increase in bad debt expense of million 
the rental program has proven to be an effective response to the adverse factors that the company faced during the industry downturn and now draws more than  applications per year to live in the properties 
the program has replaced the independent dealer network  a majority of which were forced to go out of business during the early part of the decade  which formerly directed potential residents to our properties 
the following table reflects certain financial and statistical information for the company s home sales program for the years ended december  and years ended december  change change financial information in thousands  except for statistical information new home sales pre owned home sales revenue from homes sales new home cost of sales pre owned home cost of sales cost of home sales net operating income gross profit gross profit new homes gross margin new homes gross profit pre owned homes gross margin pre owned homes statistical information home sales volume new home sales pre owned home sales total homes sold gross profit from home sales increased by million  or  as the company sold more homes than in gross profit from pre owned home sales increased by million while gross profit from new home sales declined by million 
pre owned home sales include the sale of homes that have been utilized in the company s rental program 
the cost basis of a rental home is depreciated and therefore  the gross profit margin on the sale of these homes increases the longer the home has been in the rental program 
an increase in the volume of rental home sales is the primary reason for the overall increase in pre owned home sales and therefore the principal contributor to the increase in gross profit on pre owned home sales 
while the number of new home sales increased by percent  gross profit decreased by percent 
the selling price of new homes in the florida market was reduced to facilitate sales during this period of declining demand as potential buyers  worried about dwindling retirement and investment funds  were hesitant to purchase 
the increase in new home sale volume was due  primarily  to an increase in sales of signature homes 
a new product line for the company  signature homes  have a contemporary design that compares favorably to the feel of a stick built residential home 
the increase in gross profit from signature home sales was more than offset by the decline in gross profit from the sale of new homes in florida 
other income statement items other revenues include other income loss  interest income  and ancillary revenues  net 
other revenues increased by million  from million to million  or percent 
this increase was due to a gain on sale of undeveloped land of million  increased interest income of million  offset partially by a fee paid to origen of million in connection with the transfer of the manufactured home loan servicing contract to a new service provider 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to the additional installment notes receivable recognized in association with the transfer of financial assets that are recorded as collateralized receivables in the consolidated balance sheet 
the interest income on these collateralized receivables is offset by the same amount of interest expense recognized on the secured debt recorded in association with this transaction 
see note secured borrowing and collateralized receivables for additional information 
general and administrative costs increased by million  from million to million  or percent due to increased salary  benefit  and other compensation costs of million including severance costs of million associated with the retirement of the company s former president  increased advertising costs of million  partially offset by decreases in the michigan single business tax of million and other costs of million 
the michigan single business tax was replaced by the michigan business tax and is now recorded as an income tax rather than a general and administrative expense 
depreciation and amortization costs increased by million  from million to million  or percent primarily due to the additional homes added to the company s investment property for use in the company s rental program 
interest expense on debt  including interest on mandatorily redeemable debt  decreased by million  from million to million  or percent due to a reduction in expense of approximately million related to lower interest rates charged on variable rate debt  offset by an increase in fixed rate debt interest expense of million 
the increase in fixed rate debt expense is primarily due to the company s additional secured debt recognized in association with the transfer of financial assets that was recorded as a secured borrowing in the consolidated balance sheet and is offset by the same amount of interest income recorded on collateralized receivables in relation to this transaction 
see note secured borrowing and collateralized receivables in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
equity losses from affiliates increased by million  from million to million  or percent due to increased other than temporary charges to the carrying value of the origen investment of million  and increased equity allocation of the estimated losses from affiliates of million 
provision for state income taxes decreased by million  from million to million  or percent due to a change in the effective tax rate used to calculate the deferred tax liability related to the michigan business tax 
minority interest changed by million  from income of million to expense of million since the company s operating losses are no longer allocated to the minority interest partners  and distributions of million were recorded as expense

pre owned home sales include the sale of homes that have been utilized in the company s rental program 
the cost basis of a rental home is depreciated and therefore  the gross profit margin on the sale of these homes increases the longer the home has been in the rental program 
an increase in the volume of rental home sales is the primary reason for the overall increase in pre owned home sales and therefore the principal contributor to the increase in gross profit on pre owned home sales 
the decline in new home sales profit was due to a percent decline in sales volume and a percent decline in average selling price primarily in our florida market

ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income computed in accordance gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
due to the variety among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  the company believes excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  provides a better indicator of the company s operating performance 
ffo is a useful supplemental measure of the company s operating performance because it reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs  providing perspective not readily apparent from net income 
management  the investment community and banking institutions routinely use ffo  together with other measures  to measure operating performance in our industry 
further  management uses ffo for planning and forecasting future periods 
because ffo excludes significant economic components of net income including depreciation and amortization  ffo should be used as an adjunct to net income and not as an alternative to net income 
the principal limitation of ffo is that it does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not intended as a measure of a reit s ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements  nor as a measure of working capital 
ffo only provides investors with an additional performance measure 
other reits may use different methods for calculating ffo and  accordingly  the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits

common share op unit diluted the company had an interest rate swap  which matured in july  which was not eligible for hedge accounting 
accordingly  the valuation adjustment the theoretical non cash profit or loss if the swap contract were to be terminated at the balance sheet date was recorded in interest expense 
if held to maturity the net cumulative valuation adjustment would approximate zero 
the company had no intention of terminating the swap prior to maturity and therefore excluded the valuation adjustment from ffo so as not to distort this comparative measure 
the tax provision for the year ended december  represents potential taxes payable on the sale of company assets related to the enactment of the michigan business tax 
these taxes do not impact funds from operations and would be payable from prospective proceeds of such sales 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  represents the reversal of this tax provision 
inflation most of the leases allow for periodic rent increases which provide the company with the opportunity to achieve increases in rental income as each lease expires 
such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal liquidity demands have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  distributions to the company s stockholders and the unitholders of the operating partnership  capital improvements of properties  the purchase of new and pre owned homes  property acquisitions  development and expansion of properties  and debt repayment 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements through its working capital provided by operating activities and through borrowings on its line of credit 
the company considers these resources to be adequate to meet all operating requirements  including recurring capital improvements  routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature  payment of dividends to its stockholders to maintain qualification as a reit in accordance with the internal revenue code and payment of distributions to the operating partnership s unitholders 
due to the limited amount of taxable income that the company has reported for the past few years  dividend payments to shareholders have been largely discretionary rather than required to maintain qualification as a reit 
from time to time  the company evaluates acquisition opportunities that meet the company s criteria for acquisition 
should such investment opportunities arise in  the company will finance the acquisitions though secured financing  the assumption of existing debt on the properties or the issuance of certain equity securities 
the difficulty in obtaining financing in the current credit markets may make the acquisition of properties unlikely 
the company has invested approximately million related to the acquisition of homes intended for its rental program during the year ended december  expenditures for will be dependent upon the condition of the markets for repossessions and new home sales  as well as rental homes 
the company had a million floor plan line of credit which matured on march  it was replaced by a million floor plan facility 
the company s ability to purchase homes for sale or rent may be limited by cash received from third party financing of its home sales  available floor plan financing and working capital available on its unsecured line of credit 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million from million at december   to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the company s net cash flows provided by operating activities may be adversely impacted by  among other things a the market and economic conditions in the company s current markets generally  and specifically in metropolitan areas of the company s current markets  b lower occupancy and rental rates of the company s properties the properties  c increased operating costs  such as wage and benefit costs  insurance premiums  real estate taxes and utilities  that cannot be passed on to the company s tenants  d decreased sales of manufactured homes and e current volatility in economic conditions and the financial markets 
see risk factors in item a of the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  the company has an unsecured revolving line of credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of million  subject to certain borrowing base calculations 
the outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  and was million and million  respectively 
in addition  million and million of availability was used to back standby letters of credit as of december  and borrowings under the line of credit bear an interest rate of libor plus basis points  or prime plus basis points 
the company has the option to borrow at either rate 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was percent as of december  the borrowings under the line of credit mature october   assuming an election of a one year extension that is available at the company s discretion 
as of december   million was available to be drawn under the facility based on the calculation of the borrowing base 
during  the highest balance on the line of credit was million leaving million of available credit during this peak period 
although the unsecured revolving line of credit is a committed facility  the financial failure of one or more of the participating financial institutions may reduce the amount of available credit for use by the company 
during  two of the participating banks in the company s line of credit faced financial difficulties and were purchased by other banks 
no disruption in the company s availability of credit occurred 
liquidity and capital resources  continued the line of credit facility contains various leverage  debt service coverage  net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which the company was in compliance with as of december  the most limiting covenants contained in the line of credit are the distribution coverage and debt service coverage ratios 
the distribution coverage covenant requires that distributions be no more than percent of the company s funds from operations 
the debt service coverage covenant requires a minimum ratio of as of december   the distribution coverage was percent and the debt service coverage was the sub prime credit crisis and ensuing decline in credit availability have caused turmoil in us and foreign markets 
many industries with no direct involvement with sub prime lending  securitizations  home building or mortgages have suffered share price declines as economic uncertainty has derailed investor confidence 
while many of the fundamentals of the company  and manufactured housing industry  have been improving over recent years  the company s share price has suffered 
for the company  the most relevant consequence of this financial turmoil is the uncertainty of the availability of new secured credit  floor plan financing  credit for refinancing properties and the limited credit availability on its current unsecured line of credit 
the company believes this risk is somewhat mitigated because the company has adequate working capital provided by operating activities as noted above and the company has only limited debt maturities until july specifically  the company s debt maturities excluding normal amortization payments and assuming the election of certain extension provisions which are at the discretion of the company for through are as follows million and any balance outstanding on the floor plan facility million million and any balance outstanding on the unsecured line of credit the company anticipates meeting its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  large property acquisitions  and operating partnership unit redemptions through the collateralization of its properties 
the company currently has unencumbered properties with an estimated market value of million  of which support the borrowing base for the company s million unsecured line of credit 
as of december   the borrowing base was in excess of million by million  which would allow the company to remove properties from the borrowing base at its discretion for collateralization 
from time to time  the company may also issue shares of its capital stock or preferred stock  issue equity units in the operating partnership or sell selected assets 
the ability of the company to finance its long term liquidity requirements in such a manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt  the financial condition of the company  the operating history of the properties  the state of the debt and equity markets  and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
if it were to become necessary for the company to approach the credit markets  the current volatility in the credit markets could make borrowing more difficult to secure and more expensive 
see risk factors in item a of the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  if the company is unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted 
the company s primary long term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness 
at december   the company s outstanding contractual obligations  including interest expense  were as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total due year years years after years collateralized term loan fnma collateralized term loan b of a mortgage notes  other lines of credit redeemable preferred op units secured debt total principal payments interest expense operating leases total contractual obligations the company s contractual cash obligation related to interest expense is calculated based on the current debt levels  rates and maturities as of december   and actual payments required in future periods may be different than the amounts included above 
liquidity and capital resources  continued as of december   the company s debt to total market capitalization approximated percent assuming conversion of all common operating partnership units to shares of common stock 
the debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately years and a weighted average interest rate of percent 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included recurring capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
the company is committed to the continued upkeep of its properties and therefore does not expect a significant decline in this recurring capital expenditure during net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the difference is due to a million decrease in cash received from the payoff of notes receivable  increased investment in property of million and an investment in a new affiliate of million  offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of vacant land and other assets of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the difference is due to a million increase in proceeds received from issuances of debt  a million increase in net borrowings on lines of credit  a million decrease in payments to retire preferred operating partnership units  and a decrease in payments for deferred financing costs of million  offset by an increase in repayments on notes payable and other debt of million  and increased distributions of million  and an increase in funds used for the redemption of common stock and operating partnership units of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company mitigates this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage  minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures  which include the periodic use of derivatives 
the company s primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows 
the company generally employs derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the company had entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements and an interest rate cap agreement 
one of the swap agreements fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent through july  another of the swap agreements fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent through july and the third swap agreement  which matured in july  had a notional amount of million and an effective fixed rate of percent 
the interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of percent  a notional amount of million and a termination date of april  each of the company s current derivative contracts is based upon day libor 
in addition  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in december that becomes effective january  the new swap agreement fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent through january and is based upon day libor 
the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement in february that is effective february  the new swap agreement fixes million of variable rate borrowing at percent through february and is based upon day libor 
the company s remaining variable rate debt totals million and million as of december  and  respectively  which bears interest at prime  various libor or fannie mae discounted mortgage backed securities dmbs rates 
if prime  libor  or dmbs increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  the company believes its interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  based on the million and million average balance outstanding under the company s variable rate debt facilities for the year ended december  and  respectively 
a portion of the company s variable debt is floating on fannie mae s discount mortgage backed securities rate dmbs 
if fannie mae is unable to sell this security in the market  fannie mae will hold the paper but may charge a higher rate than the prior market rate resulting in higher interest expense
