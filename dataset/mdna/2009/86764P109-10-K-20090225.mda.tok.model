item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis is management s analysis of the financial performance of sunoco  inc and subsidiaries collectively  sunoco or the company and of significant trends that may affect its future performance 
it should be read in conjunction with sunoco s consolidated financial statements and related notes under item those statements in management s discussion and analysis that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 

table of contents overview historically  sunoco s profitability has primarily been determined by refined product and chemical margins and the reliability and efficiency of its operations 
the volatility of crude oil  refined product and chemical prices and the overall supply demand balance for these commodities have had  and should continue to have  a significant impact on margins and the financial results of the company 
sunoco s profitability has been increasingly impacted by the growth in the level of earnings in its cokemaking operations 
throughout most of and  refined product margins in sunoco s principal refining centers in the northeast and midwest were very strong 
such margins benefited from stringent fuel specifications related to sulfur reductions in gasoline and diesel products  strong premiums for ethanol blended gasoline  generally tight industry refined product inventory levels on a days supply basis and strong global refined product demand coupled with refinery maintenance capital improvement downtime  which led to reductions in spare industry refining capacity 
however  refined product margins  particularly for gasoline  declined significantly in the first half of in response to record high crude oil prices and softening global demand  then strengthened in the second half of due to supply disruptions in the gulf coast attributable to hurricanes gustav and ike and declining crude oil prices 
chemical margins were weak during most of the period in response to significantly higher feedstock costs and softening demand 
in  cokemaking profitability increased significantly primarily in response to increased price realizations from coal and coke production at the company s jewell operations 
sunoco expects that refined product margins will continue to be positive  although at much lower levels than the prior three years as a weakening global economy and lower global demand should continue to place pressure on refined product margins  particularly for gasoline 
however  the completion of major capital projects in has significantly enhanced the earnings potential and flexibility of sunoco s refining assets and should continue to mitigate the adverse impact of market declines 
the company believes the profitability of the chemicals business will continue to be challenged in due to the weakening economy causing ongoing weakness in product demand 
the absolute level of refined product and chemical margins is difficult to predict as they are influenced by extremely volatile factors in the global marketplace  including the absolute level of crude oil and other feedstock prices  the effects of weather conditions on product supply and demand and the impact of a weakening global economy 
cokemaking profitability is expected to continue to increase as various growth projects in the company s coke business come on stream  although coke segment profitability will be impacted by volatility of coal prices on the jewell coal and cokemaking operations 
the company s future operating results and capital spending plans will also be impacted by environmental matters see environmental matters below 
strategic actions sunoco is committed to improving its performance and enhancing its shareholder value while  at the same time  maintaining its financial strength and flexibility by striving to deliver excellence in health  safety and environmental performance  increase reliability and realize additional operational improvements of company assets in each of its businesses  reduce expenses  efficiently manage capital spending to minimize outlays during periods of weak profitability  diversify  upgrade and grow the company s asset base through strategic acquisitions and investments  divest assets that do not meet the company s return on investment criteria  and return cash to the company s shareholders through the payment of cash dividends 

table of contents sunoco has undertaken the following initiatives as part of this strategy in the refining and supply business announced in december its intention to sell the tulsa refinery or convert it to a terminal by the end of  completed a million project in may to expand the capacity of one of the fluid catalytic cracking units at the philadelphia refinery by thousand barrels per day  which enables an upgrade of an additional thousand barrels per day of residual fuel production into higher value gasoline and distillate production and expands crude oil flexibility  completed a million project in july at the toledo refinery  which expands the facility s crude processing capability by thousand barrels per day 
in  additional work was performed at this facility to expand crude processing capability by an additional thousand barrels per day  and completed capital projects in totaling million to comply with the tier ii low sulfur gasoline and on road diesel fuel requirements 
in the retail marketing business continued to execute a retail portfolio management program in designed to enhance overall return on capital employed in the business 
under this program  sunoco is selectively reducing its invested capital in company owned or leased sites  while retaining most of the gasoline sales volumes attributable to the divested sites 
during the period  sunoco generated million of divestment proceeds related to the sale of sites 
in early  sunoco announced the addition of approximately sites to the program and expects to generate an estimated million of proceeds  primarily over the next two years  from divestment activities 
in the chemicals business announced in december its decision to sell the business if it can obtain an appropriate value  and announced in january its decision to permanently shut down the bayport  tx polypropylene plant no later than april  in the logistics business completed an acquisition totaling million in november of a refined products pipeline system  refined products terminal facilities and certain other related assets located in texas and louisiana  continued construction in of a crude oil pipeline from the nederland terminal to motiva enterprise llc s port arthur  tx refinery and three related crude oil storage tanks  which are to be completed in at a cost of approximately million  and completed acquisitions totaling million in march of two crude oil pipeline systems and related storage facilities located in texas 
in the coke business commenced construction in of a thousand tons per year cokemaking facility in granite city  il 
suncoke energy will own and operate the new facility  which is expected to cost approximately million and be completed in the fourth quarter of  entered into an agreement in to build  own and operate a thousand tons per year cokemaking facility and associated cogeneration power plant capable of providing megawatts of power in middletown  oh 
construction of these facilities  which is expected to cost approximately million  is subject to resolution of all contingencies  including necessary 
table of contents permits 
the facilities are expected to be completed to months after resolution of the contingencies  which may move the targeted completion date beyond the previously announced  completed construction and began operations in at haverhill ii  a second thousand tons per year cokemaking facility and associated cogeneration power plant located at the company s haverhill  oh site  began operations in at a new million tons per year cokemaking facility in vit ria  brazil 
suncoke energy has a million preferred stock investment in this facility and receives fees for operating the plant as well as for licensing its proprietary technology to the project company  and completed in december the million purchase of the minority interest in the jewell cokemaking operations 
sunoco also commenced a business improvement initiative in the fourth quarter of to reduce costs and improve business processes 
implementation is expected to commence in the first quarter of with a goal of significantly reducing costs by moving the company s cost structure from an average industry performance to first quartile performance 
cash outlays in connection with this initiative  which largely consist of severance and related benefits  are likely to occur over approximately one year 
however  the company does not expect these cash costs to be incremental to the salary and benefits which would otherwise have been paid to employees who are terminated 
repurchased  and million shares during  and  respectively  of its outstanding common stock for  and million  respectively 
additional repurchases of company stock will be dependent on prevailing market conditions  available cash and the attractiveness of repurchasing stock relative to other investment alternatives  and increased the quarterly cash dividend on its common stock  effective with the second quarter of  to

table of contents refining and supply segment results decreased million in primarily due to higher expenses million and lower production volumes million 
also contributing to the decline were lower realized margins million 
the higher expenses were largely the result of increased prices for purchased fuel and utilities 
production volumes decreased approximately million barrels in compared to planned and unplanned maintenance work and economically driven rate reductions in reduced production throughout the refining system  while production in was negatively impacted by major turnaround and expansion work at the philadelphia refinery as well as a turnaround at the tulsa refinery 
in  sunoco announced its intention to sell its tulsa refinery or convert it to a terminal by the end of and  as a result  recorded a million after tax provision to write down the affected assets to their estimated fair values 
this charge is reported as part of the asset write downs and other matters shown separately in corporate and other in the earnings profile of sunoco businesses see note to the consolidated financial statements under item 
refining and supply segment results decreased million in largely due to higher expenses million and lower realized margins million  partially offset by higher production volumes million and a lower effective income tax rate million 
the lower margins reflect the negative impact of higher average crude oil costs  while the higher expenses were largely the result of costs associated with the major turnaround and expansion work at the philadelphia refinery and the turnaround work at the tulsa refinery as well as increased operating costs to produce low sulfur fuels 
retail marketing the retail marketing business sells gasoline and middle distillates at retail and operates convenience stores in states  primarily on the east coast and in the midwest region of the united states 
income millions of dollars retail margin per barrel gasoline middle distillates sales thousands of barrels daily gasoline middle distillates retail gasoline outlets retail sales price less related wholesale price and terminalling and transportation costs per barrel 
the retail sales price is the weighted average price received through the various branded marketing distribution channels 
retail marketing segment income increased million in primarily due to higher retail gasoline million and distillate million margins  partially offset by lower retail gasoline million and distillate million sales volumes and lower divestment gains attributable to the retail portfolio management program million  in part due to the recognition in of impairment losses and associated costs totaling million after tax on certain properties held for sale 
retail marketing segment income decreased million in primarily due to lower average retail gasoline margins million and higher expenses million  which include a million after tax charge associated with a litigation settlement in and a million after tax charge related to an environmental litigation accrual in partially offsetting these negative factors were higher gains attributable to the retail portfolio management program million and higher average distillate margins million 

table of contents during the period  sunoco generated million of divestment proceeds related to the sale of sites under a retail portfolio management rpm program to selectively reduce the company s invested capital in company owned or leased sites 
most of the sites were converted to contract dealers or distributors thereby retaining most of the gasoline sales volume attributable to the divested sites within the sunoco branded business 
during  and  net after tax gains totaling  and million  respectively  were recognized in connection with the rpm program 
in early  sunoco announced the addition of approximately sites to the rpm program 
there are currently approximately sites in the program  of which approximately are company operated locations 
these sites are expected to be divested or converted to contract dealers or distributors primarily over the next two years  generating an estimated million of divestment proceeds 
chemicals the chemicals business manufactures phenol and related products at chemical plants in philadelphia  pa and haverhill  oh  and polypropylene at facilities in laporte  tx  neal  wv  bayport  tx and marcus hook  pa 
the chemicals business also distributes and markets these products 
sunoco intends to permanently shut down the bayport polypropylene facility no later than april  sunoco also intents to sell its chemicals business if it can obtain an appropriate value 
income millions of dollars margin cents per pound all products phenol and related products polypropylene sales millions of pounds phenol and related products polypropylene other wholesale sales revenue less the cost of feedstocks  product purchases and related terminalling and transportation divided by sales volumes 
the polypropylene and all products margins include the impact of a long term supply contract with equistar chemicals  lp which is priced on a cost based formula that includes a fixed discount 
chemicals segment income increased million in due primarily to higher margins million and lower expenses million  partially offset by lower sales volumes million and a provision to write down polypropylene inventory to market value million 
the lower expenses were largely due to the transfer of cumene and propylene splitter assets to refining and supply  effective january  chemicals segment income decreased million in primarily due to higher expenses million  lower margins million and the absence of a deferred tax benefit recognized in as a result of a state tax law change million 
during january  sunoco decided that it will permanently shut down its bayport  tx polypropylene plant which has become uneconomic to operate and in also determined that the goodwill related to its polypropylene business no longer had value 
in connection therewith  the company recorded a million after tax provision to write down the affected bayport assets to estimated fair value and to write off the remaining polypropylene business goodwill 
during  sunoco decided to permanently shut down a previously idled phenol production line at its haverhill  oh plant that had become uneconomic to restart 
in connection with this shutdown  the company recorded an million after tax provision to write off the affected 
table of contents production line 
during  sunoco also recorded a million after tax loss associated with the sale of its neville island  pa terminal facility  which included an accrual for enhanced pension benefits associated with employee terminations and for other required exit costs 
these items are reported as part of the asset write downs and other matters shown separately in corporate and other in the earnings profile of sunoco businesses see note to the consolidated financial statements under item 
during  sunoco formed a limited partnership with equistar chemicals  lp equistar involving equistar s ethylene facility in laporte  tx 
equistar is a wholly owned subsidiary of lyondellbasell industries 
under the terms of the partnership agreement  the partnership has agreed to provide sunoco with million pounds per year of propylene for years priced on a cost based formula that includes a fixed discount that declines over the life of the partnership 
under a separate year supply contract  equistar provides sunoco with million pounds per year of propylene at market prices 
through the partnership and the supply contract  the company believes it has secured a favorable long term supply of propylene for its gulf coast polypropylene business 
realization of these benefits is largely dependent upon performance by equistar 
in january  lyondellbasell industries announced that its us operations including equistar filed to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
neither the partnership nor the equistar entities that are partners of the partnership has filed for bankruptcy 
in addition  equistar has not given any indication that it will not perform under its contracts 
sunoco does not believe that the bankruptcy will have a significant adverse impact on its business 
however  in the event of nonperformance  sunoco has oversight  performance and other contractual rights under the partnership agreement 
logistics the logistics business operates refined product and crude oil pipelines and terminals and conducts crude oil acquisition and marketing activities primarily in the northeast  midwest and south central regions of the united states 
in addition  the logistics business has an ownership interest in several refined product and crude oil pipeline joint ventures 
substantially all logistics operations are conducted through sunoco logistics partners lp the partnership  a consolidated master limited partnership 
sunoco has a percent interest in sunoco logistics partners lp  which includes its percent general partnership interest see capital resources and liquidity other cash flow information below 
income millions of dollars pipeline and terminal throughput thousands of barrels daily unaffiliated customers affiliated customers excludes joint venture operations 
logistics segment income increased million in due to record results from sunoco logistics partners lp primarily resulting from increased pipeline fees and higher lease acquisition margins in its western pipeline system 
also contributing to the increase were higher earnings from the eastern pipeline system and terminalling operations 
logistics segment income increased million in largely due to higher earnings from terminalling operations  crude oil acquisition and marketing activities and the partnership s acquisitions completed in  partially offset by a reduction in sunoco s ownership in the partnership subsequent to the public equity offering in 
table of contents in november  the partnership purchased a refined products pipeline system  refined products terminal facilities and certain other related assets located in texas and louisiana from affiliates of exxon mobil corporation for million 
in march  the partnership purchased two separate crude oil pipeline systems and related storage facilities located in texas  one from affiliates of black hills energy  inc black hills for million and the other from affiliates of alon usa energy  inc for million 
the black hills acquisition also includes a lease acquisition marketing business and related inventory 
during  the partnership continued its construction of new crude oil storage tanks  four of which were placed into service in and three in in august  the partnership purchased from sunoco for million a company that has a percent interest in mid valley pipeline company  a joint venture which owns a crude oil pipeline system in the midwest 
sunoco did not recognize any gain or loss on this transaction 
the partnership intends to take advantage of additional growth opportunities in the future  both within its current system and with third party acquisitions 
coke the coke business  through suncoke energy  inc and its affiliates individually and collectively  suncoke energy  currently makes high quality  blast furnace coke at its indiana harbor facility in east chicago  in  at its jewell facility in vansant  va  at its haverhill facilities in franklin furnace  oh  and at a facility in vit ria  brazil  and produces metallurgical coal from mines in virginia  primarily for use at the jewell cokemaking facility 
in addition  the indiana harbor plant produces heat as a by product that is used by a third party to produce electricity 
the haverhill facility produces steam that is sold to sunoco s chemicals business and electricity from its associated cogeneration power plant for the regional power market 
the vit ria  brazil facility commenced operations in suncoke energy is the operator of the vit ria facility  and  during  increased its investment in the project company by becoming the sole subscriber of preferred shares for a total equity interest of million 
an additional cokemaking facility is currently under construction in granite city  il  which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of and an agreement has been entered into for a cokemaking facility and associated cogeneration power plant to be built  owned and operated by suncoke energy in middletown  oh  which is subject to resolution of all contingencies  including necessary permits 
income millions of dollars coke production thousands of tons united states brazil coke segment income increased million in primarily due to increased price realizations from coke production at jewell 
partially offsetting this positive factor were higher minority interest  selling  general and administrative and depreciation expenses 
coke segment income decreased million in primarily due to a million increase in the partial phase out of tax credits resulting from the high level of crude oil prices and the absence of a million investment tax credit adjustment related to the haverhill facility 
also contributing to the decline in earnings were higher costs and lower sales prices at the jewell coal operations and higher depreciation and selling  general and administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these negative factors was million of income from the cokemaking facility in vit ria  brazil 
in and  coke recorded and percent  respectively  of the tax credits that otherwise would have been available without regard to the phase out provisions with the partial phase out reducing earnings by and million  respectively  during those periods 
sunoco received a total of million in exchange for interests in its jewell cokemaking operations in two separate transactions in and sunoco also received a total of million in exchange for interests in its indiana harbor cokemaking operations in two separate transactions in and sunoco did not recognize any gain as of the dates of these transactions because the third party investors were entitled to a 
table of contents preferential return on their respective investments 
in december  sunoco acquired the limited partnership interest of the third party investor in the jewell cokemaking operation for million and recognized a million after tax loss in in connection with this transaction 
this loss is included in net financing expenses and other under corporate and other in the earnings profile of sunoco businesses 
the returns of the investors in the indiana harbor cokemaking operations were equal to percent of the cash flows and tax benefits from such cokemaking operations during the preferential return period  which continued until the fourth quarter of at which time the investor entitled to the preferential return recovered its investment and achieved a cumulative annual after tax return of approximately percent 
those investors are now entitled to a minority interest amounting to percent of the partnership s net income  which declines to percent by prior to completion of the preferential return periods  expense was recognized to reflect the investors preferential returns in the jewell and indiana harbor operations 
such expense  which is included in net financing expenses and other under corporate and other in the earnings profile of sunoco businesses  totaled and million after tax in and  respectively 
income is recognized by the coke business as coke production and sales generate cash flows and tax benefits 
such cash flows and tax benefits were allocated to sunoco and the third party investors prior to completion of the preferential return periods 
the coke business after tax income attributable to the tax benefits  which primarily consist of nonconventional fuel credits  was  and million after tax in  and  respectively 
under existing tax law  beginning in  most of the coke production at jewell and all of the coke production at indiana harbor are no longer eligible to generate nonconventional fuel tax credits 
with the completion of the preferential return periods  the third party investor s share of net income is now recognized as minority interest expense by the coke business 
with respect to the jewell operation  beginning in  the price of coke from this facility thousand tons per year changed from a fixed price to an amount equal to the sum of i the cost of delivered coal to the haverhill facility multiplied by an adjustment factor  ii actual transportation costs  iii an operating cost component indexed for inflation  and iv a fixed price component 
in february  suncoke energy entered into an agreement with two affiliates of oao severstal under which a local affiliate of suncoke energy would build  own and operate an expansion of the haverhill plant that would double this facility s cokemaking capacity to million tons of coke per year and a cogeneration power plant 
limited operations from this cokemaking facility commenced in july with full operations expected in the second quarter of total capital outlays for the project are estimated at million  of which million has been spent through december  in connection with this agreement  two affiliates of oao severstal agreed to purchase  over a year period  thousand tons per year of coke from the cokemaking facility 
the flue gas produced during the cokemaking process is used to generate low cost steam that is sold to the adjacent chemical manufacturing complex owned and operated by sunoco s chemicals business and electricity for sale into the regional power market 
the cogeneration plant  which includes a megawatt turbine  is expected to provide  on average  megawatts of power 
with the income attributable to this project and the anticipated impact of higher coal prices on jewell coke prices in  coke s income is expected to total approximately million after tax for the full year substantially all coke sales from the indiana harbor and jewell plants and percent of the production from the haverhill plant once it becomes fully operational are made pursuant to long term contracts with affiliates of arcelormittal 
the balance of coke produced at the haverhill plant is sold to two affiliates of oao severstal under long term contracts 
in addition  the technology and operating fees  as well as preferred dividends pertaining to the brazilian cokemaking operation are payable to suncoke energy under long term contracts with a project company in which a brazilian subsidiary of arcelormittal is the major shareholder 
neither arcelormittal nor oao severstal has provided any indication that they will not perform under those contracts 
however  in the event of nonperformance  suncoke energy s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected 

table of contents in february  suncoke energy entered into an agreement with us steel under which suncoke energy will build  own and operate a thousand tons per year cokemaking facility adjacent to us steel s steelmaking facility in granite city  illinois 
construction of this facility  which is estimated to cost approximately million  is currently underway and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of expenditures through december  totaled million 
in connection with this agreement  us steel has agreed to purchase  over a year period  such coke production as well as the steam generated from the heat recovery cokemaking process at this facility 
in march  suncoke energy entered into an agreement with ak steel under which suncoke energy will build  own and operate a cokemaking facility and associated cogeneration power plant adjacent to ak steel s middletown  ohio steelmaking facility subject to resolution of all contingencies  including necessary permits 
these facilities are expected to cost in aggregate approximately million and be completed to months after resolution of the contingencies  which may move the targeted completion date beyond the previously announced the plant is expected to produce thousand tons of coke per year and on average  megawatts of power into the regional power market 
in connection with this agreement  ak steel has agreed to purchase  over a year period  all of the coke and available electrical power from these facilities 
expenditures through december  totaled million  with additional funds committed of approximately million 
in the event contingencies including permit issues to constructing the project cannot be resolved  ak steel is obligated to reimburse substantially all of these amounts to sunoco 
suncoke energy is currently discussing other opportunities for developing new heat recovery cokemaking facilities with domestic and international steel companies 
such cokemaking facilities could be either wholly owned or developed through other business structures 
as applicable  the steel company customers would be expected to purchase coke production under long term contracts 
the facilities would also generate steam  which would typically be sold to the steel customer  or electrical power  which could be sold to the steel customer or into the local power market 
suncoke energy s ability to enter into additional arrangements is dependent upon market conditions in the steel industry 
corporate and other corporate expenses corporate administrative expenses decreased million in primarily due to the absence of an adjustment to charitable contributions expense that was made in and lower accruals for performance related incentive compensation 
in  corporate administrative expenses increased million in part due to the adjustment to charitable contributions expense 
net financing expenses and other net financing expenses and other decreased million in primarily due to higher capitalized interest million and the absence of expense attributable to the preferential return of third party investors in sunoco s indiana harbor cokemaking operations million

see notes and to the consolidated financial statements under item income tax matters during  sunoco recognized a million after tax gain related primarily to tax credits claimed on amended federal income tax returns filed for certain prior years and a million after tax gain related to the settlement of economic nexus issues pertaining to certain prior year state corporate income tax returns see note to the consolidated financial statements under item 
issuance of sunoco logistics partners lp limited partnership units during and  sunoco recognized after tax gains totaling and million  respectively  related to the prior issuance of limited partnership units of the partnership to the public 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under item analysis of consolidated statements of income revenues total revenues were billion in  billion in and billion in the percent increase in was primarily due to higher refined product prices as well as higher crude oil prices in connection with the crude oil gathering and marketing activities of the company s logistics operations 
partially offsetting these positive factors were lower refined product sales volumes 
in  the percent increase was primarily due to higher refined product prices and sales volumes as well as higher crude oil sales in connection with the crude oil gathering and marketing activities of the company s logistics operations 
costs and expenses total pretax costs and expenses were billion in  billion in and billion in the and percent increases in and  respectively  were primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product acquisition costs resulting largely from price increases and higher crude oil costs in connection with the crude oil gathering and marketing activities of the company s logistics operations 
financial condition capital resources and liquidity cash and working capital at december   sunoco had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  and million at december  and had a working capital deficit of  million compared to  million at december  and million at december  the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents in was due to a  million net use of cash in investing activities  partially offset by million of net cash provided by operating activities cash generation and million of net cash provided by financing activities 
the million increase in cash and cash equivalents in was due to  million of cash generation  partially offset by a  million net use of cash in investing activities and a million net use of cash in financing activities 
management believes that the current levels of cash and working capital are adequate to support sunoco s ongoing operations 
sunoco s working capital position is considerably stronger than indicated because of the relatively low historical costs assigned under the lifo method of accounting for most of the inventories reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
the current replacement cost of all such inventories exceeded their carrying value at december  by  million 
inventories valued at lifo  which consist of crude oil as well as petroleum and chemical products  are readily marketable at their current replacement values 
certain recent legislative and regulatory proposals effectively could limit  or even eliminate  use of the lifo inventory method for financial and income tax purposes 
although the final outcome of these proposals cannot be ascertained at this time  the ultimate impact to sunoco of the transition from lifo to another inventory method could be material 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities in  sunoco s cash generation was million compared to  million in and million in the  million decrease in cash generation in was primarily due to an increase in working capital levels pertaining to operating activities 
the  million increase in cash generation in was primarily due to a decrease in working capital levels pertaining to operating activities and the absence of a million payment of damages to honeywell international inc in in connection with a phenol supply contract dispute  partially offset by lower net income 
increases in crude oil prices typically increase cash generation as the payment terms on sunoco s crude oil purchases are generally longer than the terms on product sales 
conversely  decreases in crude oil prices typically result in a decline in cash generation 
crude oil prices decreased in after increasing in other cash flow information divestment activities also have been a source of cash 
during the period  proceeds from divestments totaled million and related primarily to the divestment of retail gasoline outlets 
in  sunoco logistics partners lp issued million limited partnership units in a public offering  generating million of net proceeds 
upon completion of this transaction  sunoco s interest in the partnership  including its percent general partnership interest  decreased to percent 
sunoco s general partnership interest also includes incentive distribution rights  which provide sunoco  as the general partner  up to percent of the partnership s incremental cash flow 
the partnership acquired interests in various pipelines and other logistics assets during the period  which were financed with borrowings or from the proceeds from the equity offering see capital program below 
the partnership expects to finance future growth opportunities with a combination of borrowings and the issuance of additional limited partnership units to the public to maintain a balanced capital structure 
any issuance of limited partnership units to the public would dilute sunoco s ownership interest in the partnership 
sunoco is a party to various agreements with the partnership which require sunoco to pay for minimum storage and throughput usage of certain partnership assets 
sunoco s obligations under these agreements may be reduced or suspended under certain circumstances 
sunoco also has agreements with the partnership which establish fees for administrative services provided by sunoco to the partnership and provide indemnifications by sunoco for certain environmental  toxic tort and other liabilities 
financial capacity management currently believes that future cash generation will be sufficient to satisfy sunoco s ongoing capital requirements  to fund its pension obligations see pension plan funded status below and to pay the current level of cash dividends on sunoco s common stock 
however  from time to time  the company s short term cash requirements may exceed its cash generation due to various factors including reductions in margins for products sold and increases in the levels of capital spending including acquisitions and working capital 
during those periods  the company may supplement its cash generation with proceeds from financing activities 
the company has a billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of participating banks the facility  of which billion matures in august with the balance to mature in august the facility provides the company with access to short term financing and is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper  letters of credit and other debt 
the company also can borrow directly from the participating banks under the facility 
in september  lehman brothers  one of the participating banks with a commitment under the facility amounting to million  declared bankruptcy and the company believes lehman brothers will not fund its loan commitment 
the facility is subject to commitment fees  which are not material 
under the terms of the facility  sunoco is required to maintain tangible net worth as defined in the facility in an amount greater than or equal to targeted tangible net worth targeted tangible net worth being determined by adding billion and percent of the excess of net income over share repurchases as defined in the facility for each quarter ended after march

as with the industry generally  compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases the overall cost of operating sunoco s businesses  including remediation  operating costs and capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities 
existing laws and regulations have required  and are expected to continue to require  sunoco to make significant expenditures of both a capital and an expense nature 
the following table summarizes sunoco s expenditures for environmental projects and compliance activities in millions of dollars pollution abatement capital remediation operations  maintenance and administration capital expenditures for pollution abatement include amounts to comply with the tier ii low sulfur fuel requirements completed in and the consent decrees pertaining to certain alleged clean air act violations at the company s refineries 
pollution abatement capital outlays are expected to approximate and million in and  respectively 
remediation activities information regarding remediation activities at sunoco s facilities and at formerly owned or third party sites is included in the discussion under environmental remediation activities in note to the consolidated financial statements item and is incorporated herein by reference 
regulatory matters the us environmental protection agency epa adopted rules under the clean air act which relates to emissions of materials into the air that phased in limits on the sulfur content of gasoline beginning in and the sulfur content of on road diesel fuel beginning in mid tier ii 
tier ii capital spending  which was completed in  totaled million 
in addition  higher operating costs are being incurred as the low sulfur fuels are produced 
in may  the epa adopted another rule which is phasing in limits on the allowable sulfur content in off road diesel fuel that began in june this rule provides for banking and trading credit systems and largely relates to operations at sunoco s tulsa refinery 
in connection with the phase in of these off road diesel fuel rules  sunoco had initiated an approximately million capital project at the tulsa refinery  which included a new thousand barrels per day hydrotreating unit  sulfur recovery unit and tail gas treater 
in  sunoco elected not to proceed with this project 
sunoco intends to sell the tulsa refinery or convert it to a terminal by the end of national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone and fine particles promulgated by the epa have resulted in identification of non attainment areas throughout the country  including texas  pennsylvania  ohio  new jersey and west virginia  where sunoco operates facilities 
areas designated by epa as moderate 
table of contents non attainment for ozone  including philadelphia and houston  would be required to meet the ozone requirements by  before currently mandated federal control programs take effect 
in january  the epa issued a finding that the philadelphia and houston state implementation plans sips failed to demonstrate attainment by the deadline 
this finding is expected to result in more stringent offset requirements and could result in other negative consequences 
in december  the district of columbia circuit court of appeals overturned the epa s ozone attainment plan  including revocation of clean air act section a fee provisions 
sunoco will likely be subject to non attainment fees in houston  but any additional costs are not expected to be material 
in  the epa also identified counties which  based on data  now are in attainment of the fine particles standard 
sunoco s toledo refinery is within one of these attainment areas 
in september  the epa issued a final rule tightening the standard for fine particles 
this standard is currently being challenged in federal court by various states and environmental groups 
in march  the epa issued final rules to implement the fine particle matter pm standards 
states had until april to submit plans to the epa demonstrating attainment by or  at the latest  however  the march rule does not address attainment of the september standard 
in march  the epa promulgated a new  more stringent ozone standard  which was challenged in a lawsuit in may by environmental organizations 
regulatory programs  when established to implement the epa s air quality standards  could have an impact on sunoco and its operations 
however  the potential financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated until the lawsuit is resolved  the epa promulgates regulatory programs to attain the standards  and the states  as necessary  develop and implement revised sips to respond to the new regulations 
through the operation of its refineries  chemical plants  marketing facilities and coke plants  sunoco s operations emit greenhouse gases ghg  including carbon dioxide 
there are various legislative and regulatory measures to address ghg emissions which are in various stages of review  discussion or implementation 
these include federal and state actions to develop programs for the reduction of ghg emissions 
while it is currently not possible to predict the impact  if any  that these issues will have on the company or the industry in general  they could result in increases in costs to operate and maintain the company s facilities  as well as capital outlays for new emission control equipment at these facilities 
in addition  regulations limiting ghg emissions or carbon content of products  which target specific industries such as petroleum refining or chemical or coke manufacturing could adversely affect the company s ability to conduct its business and also may reduce demand for its products 
mtbe litigation information regarding certain mtbe litigation in which sunoco is a defendant is included in the discussion under mtbe litigation in note to the consolidated financial statements item and is incorporated herein by reference 
conclusion management believes that the environmental matters discussed above are potentially significant with respect to results of operations or cash flows for any one year 
however  management does not believe that such matters will have a material impact on sunoco s consolidated financial position or  over an extended period of time  on sunoco s cash flows or liquidity 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk sunoco uses swaps  options  futures  forwards and other derivative instruments to hedge a variety of commodity price risks 
derivative instruments are used from time to time to achieve ratable pricing of crude oil purchases  to convert certain expected refined product sales to fixed or floating prices  to lock in what sunoco considers to be acceptable margins for various refined products and to lock in the price of a portion of the company s electricity and natural gas purchases or sales 
sunoco does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents sunoco uses ethanol as an oxygenate component in gasoline 
most of the ethanol purchased by sunoco in recent years has been through normal fixed price purchase contracts 
however  increasingly in  sunoco has satisfied its ethanol purchase commitments utilizing contracts based on spot market prices 
to reduce the margin risk created by the purchases utilizing fixed price contracts  the company enters into derivative contracts to sell gasoline at a fixed price to hedge a similar volume of forecasted floating price gasoline sales over the term of the ethanol contracts 
in effect  these derivative contracts lock in an acceptable differential between the gasoline price and the cost of the fixed price ethanol purchases for gasoline blending 
as a result of changes in the price of gasoline  the fair value of the fixed price gasoline contracts increased decreased  and million  and million after tax in  and  respectively 
as these derivative contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges  these changes in fair value are not initially included in earnings but rather are reflected in the net hedging losses component of comprehensive income 
the fair value of these contracts at the time the positions are closed is recognized in earnings when the hedged items are recognized in earnings  with sunoco s margin reflecting the differential between the gasoline sales prices hedged to a fixed price and the cost of fixed price ethanol purchases 
net gains losses totaling  and million  and million after tax were reclassified to earnings in  and  respectively  when the hedged items were recognized in earnings 
sunoco is at risk for possible changes in the market value of all of its derivative contracts  including the fixed price gasoline sales contracts discussed above  however  such risk would be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged items 
at december   sunoco had net derivative losses  before income taxes  of million on all of its open derivative contracts 
open contracts as of december  vary in duration but generally do not extend beyond the potential decline in the market value of these derivatives from a hypothetical percent adverse change in the year end market prices of the underlying commodities that were being hedged by derivative contracts at december  was estimated to be million 
this hypothetical loss was estimated by multiplying the difference between the hypothetical and the actual year end market prices of the underlying commodities by the contract volume amounts 
sunoco also is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by derivative counterparties 
management believes this risk is not significant as the company has established credit limits with such counterparties which require the settlement of net positions when these credit limits are reached 
as a result  the company had no significant derivative counterparty credit exposure at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements under item 
interest rate risk sunoco has market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its outstanding borrowings 
sunoco manages this exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   the company had  million of fixed rate debt and million of floating rate debt 
a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s fixed rate borrowings at december  by approximately million 
however  such change in interest rates would not have a material impact on income or cash flows as the majority of the outstanding borrowings consisted of fixed rate instruments 
sunoco also has market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its retirement benefit plans see critical accounting policies retirement benefit liabilities below 
sunoco generally does not use derivatives to manage its market risk exposure to changing interest rates

additional repurchases of company stock will be dependent on prevailing market conditions  available cash and the attractiveness of repurchasing stock relative to other investment alternatives 
the company currently has no plans to repurchase any of its common stock during critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements item 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of sunoco s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions consist of retirement benefit liabilities  long lived assets and environmental remediation activities 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ to some extent from the estimates on which the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared at any point in time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes the company s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
management has reviewed the assumptions underlying its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of sunoco s board of directors 
retirement benefit liabilities sunoco has both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans which provide retirement benefits for approximately one half of its employees 
sunoco also has postretirement benefit plans which provide health care benefits for substantially all of its retirees 
the postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and the costs are shared by sunoco and its retirees 
the levels of required retiree contributions to these plans are adjusted periodically  and the plans contain other cost sharing features  such as deductibles and coinsurance 
in addition  there is a dollar cap on sunoco s future contributions for its principal postretirement health care benefits plan  which significantly reduces the impact of future cost increases on the estimated postretirement benefit expense and benefit obligation 
the principal assumptions that impact the determination of both expense and benefit obligations for sunoco s pension plans are the discount rate  the long term expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate and the health care cost trend are the principal assumptions that impact the determination of expense and benefit obligations for sunoco s postretirement health care benefit plans 
the discount rates used to determine the present value of future pension payments and medical costs are based on a portfolio of high quality aa rated corporate bonds with maturities that reflect the duration of sunoco s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the present values of sunoco s future pension and other postretirement obligations were determined using discount rates of and percent  respectively  at december  and and percent  respectively  at december  sunoco s expense under 
table of contents these plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the year  which for pension plans was percent for  percent for  percent for  and will be percent for  and for postretirement plans was percent for  percent for  percent for  and will be percent for the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was assumed to be percent while the rate of compensation increase was assumed to be percent for each of the last three years 
a long term expected rate of return of percent on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase of percent will be used to determine sunoco s pension expense for the expected rate of return on plan assets is estimated utilizing a variety of factors including the historical investment return achieved over a long term period  the targeted allocation of plan assets and expectations concerning future returns in the marketplace for both equity and debt securities 
in determining pension expense  the company applies the expected rate of return to the market related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year  which is determined using a quarterly average of plan assets from the preceding year 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption 
it generally will differ from the actual annual return which is subject to considerable year to year variability 
as permitted by existing accounting rules  the company does not recognize currently in pension expense the difference between the expected and actual return on assets 
rather  the difference along with other actuarial gains or losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used in accounting for the plans primarily the discount rate and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience are fully recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in prepaid retirement costs or an increase in the retirement liability with a corresponding charge initially to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity 
if such actuarial gains and losses on a cumulative basis exceed percent of the projected benefit obligation  the excess is amortized into income as a component of pension or postretirement benefits expense over the average remaining service period of plan participants still employed with the company  which currently is approximately years 
sunoco could also be required to accelerate the recognition of a portion of its cumulative actuarial losses into income if the amount of pension liabilities settled in a given year is greater than the service and interest cost components of its defined benefit plans expense 
if this were to occur with respect to the company s principal defined benefit plan  the minimum charge to earnings for would be approximately million after tax  based on the plan s cumulative actuarial losses at december  at december   the accumulated net actuarial loss for defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans was and million  respectively 
for  the pension plan assets generated a negative return of percent  compared to positive returns of percent in and percent in for the year period ended december   the compounded annual investment return on sunoco s pension plan assets was a positive return of percent 
the asset allocation for sunoco s pension plans at december  and and the target allocation of plan assets for  by asset category  are as follows in percentages target december asset category equity securities debt securities other total the rate of compensation increase assumption has been indicative of actual increases during the period 
the initial health care cost trend assumptions used to compute the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were increases of percent  percent and percent at december   and  respectively 
these trend rates were assumed to decline gradually to percent in and to remain at that level thereafter 

table of contents set forth below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement benefits expense and benefit obligations that would occur in from a change in the indicated assumptions dollars in millions change in rate expense benefit obligations pension benefits decrease in the discount rate decrease in the long term expected rate of return on plan assets increase in rate of compensation postretirement benefits decrease in the discount rate increase in the annual health care cost trend rates represents the projected benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations for postretirement benefit plans 
long lived assets the cost of plants and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
changes in useful lives that do not result in the impairment of an asset are recognized prospectively 
there have been no significant changes in the useful lives of the company s plants and equipment during the period 
a decision to dispose of an asset may necessitate an impairment review 
in this situation  an impairment would be recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value less cost to sell 
long lived assets  other than those held for sale  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  among other factors operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines  technological developments resulting in obsolescence  changes in demand for the company s products or in end use goods manufactured by others utilizing the company s products as raw materials  changes in the company s business plans or those of its major customers  suppliers or other business partners  changes in competition and competitive practices  uncertainties associated with the united states and world economies  changes in the expected level of capital  operating or environmental remediation expenditures  and changes in governmental regulations or actions 
additional factors impacting the economic viability of long lived assets are described under forward looking statements below 
a long lived asset that is not held for sale is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount 
such estimated future cash flows are highly subjective and are based on numerous assumptions about future operations and market conditions 
the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the impaired asset 
it is also difficult to precisely estimate fair market value because quoted market prices for the company s long lived assets may not be readily available 
therefore  fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets being reviewed for impairment 
sunoco had asset impairments totaling and million after tax during and  respectively 
the impairments in related to the tulsa refinery  which the company intends to sell or convert to a terminal by the end of  a polypropylene plant in bayport  tx which the company intends to permanently shut down no later than april   goodwill related to the company s polypropylene business  and certain retail 
table of contents marketing properties held for sale in the company s retail portfolio management program 
the impairment in related to the permanent shutdown of a previously idled phenol line at the company s haverhill  oh plant 
for a further discussion of these asset impairments  see note to the consolidated financial statements item 
there were no asset impairments in environmental remediation activities sunoco is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or that otherwise relate to the protection of the environment  waste management and the characteristics and composition of fuels 
these laws and regulations require environmental assessment and or remediation efforts at many of sunoco s facilities and at formerly owned or third party sites 
sunoco s accrual for environmental remediation activities amounted to million at december  this accrual is for work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
the accrual is undiscounted and is based on currently available information  estimated timing of remedial actions and related inflation assumptions  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
it is often extremely difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs due to changing regulations  changing technologies and their associated costs  and changes in the economic environment 
in the above instances  if a range of probable environmental cleanup costs exists for an identified site  fasb interpretation no 
 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss  requires that the minimum of the range be accrued unless some other point in the range is more likely  in which case the most likely amount in the range is accrued 
engineering studies  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated accruals for environmental remediation activities 
losses attributable to unasserted claims are also reflected in the accruals to the extent they are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable 
management believes it is reasonably possible ie  less than probable but greater than remote that additional environmental remediation losses will be incurred 
at december   the aggregate of the estimated maximum additional reasonably possible losses  which relate to numerous individual sites  totaled approximately million 
however  the company believes it is very unlikely that it will realize the maximum reasonably possible loss at every site 
furthermore  the recognition of additional losses  if and when they were to occur  would likely extend over many years and  therefore  likely would not have a material impact on the company s financial position 
management believes that none of the current remediation locations  which are in various stages of ongoing remediation  is individually material to sunoco as its largest accrual for any one superfund site  operable unit or remediation area was less than million at december  as a result  sunoco s exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material 
however  if changes in environmental laws or regulations occur  such changes could impact multiple sunoco facilities  formerly owned facilities and third party sites at the same time 
as a result  from time to time  significant charges against income for environmental remediation may occur 
under various environmental laws  including rcra  sunoco has initiated corrective remedial action at its facilities  formerly owned facilities and third party sites 
at the company s major manufacturing facilities  sunoco has consistently assumed continued industrial use and a containment remediation strategy focused on eliminating unacceptable risks to human health or the environment 
the remediation accruals for these sites reflect that strategy 
accruals include amounts to prevent off site migration and to contain the impact on the facility property  as well as to address known  discrete areas requiring remediation within the plants 
activities include closure of rcra solid waste management units  recovery of hydrocarbons  handling of impacted soil  mitigation of surface water impacts and prevention of off site migration 

table of contents many of sunoco s current terminals are being addressed with the above containment remediation strategy 
at some smaller or less impacted facilities and some previously divested terminals  the focus is on remediating discrete interior areas to attain regulatory closure 
sunoco owns or operates certain retail gasoline outlets where releases of petroleum products have occurred 
federal and state laws and regulations require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites and at formerly owned sites be assessed and remediated to meet the applicable standards 
the obligation for sunoco to remediate this type of contamination varies  depending on the extent of the release and the applicable laws and regulations 
a portion of the remediation costs may be recoverable from the reimbursement fund of the applicable state  after any deductible has been met 
in summary  total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon  among other things  the identification of any additional sites  the determination of the extent of the contamination at each site  the timing and nature of required remedial actions  the nature of operations at each site  the technology available and needed to meet the various existing legal requirements  the nature and terms of cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the availability of insurance coverage  the nature and extent of future environmental laws and regulations  inflation rates  terms of consent agreements or remediation permits with regulatory agencies and the determination of sunoco s liability at the sites  if any  in light of the number  participation level and financial viability of the other parties
