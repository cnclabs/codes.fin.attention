overview response genetics  inc the company was incorporated in the state of delaware on september  as bio type  inc for the purpose of providing unique molecular profiling services of tumor tissue that has been formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin wax 
in august  we changed our name to response genetics  inc in november  we established response genetics ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary in edinburgh  scotland 
on february  we implemented a reduction of workforce pursuant to which we are closing our subsidiary in edinburgh 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
clinical studies have shown that not all cancer chemotherapy works effectively in every patient  and that a number of patients receive therapy that has no benefit to them and may potentially even be harmful 
our goal is to provide cancer patients and their physicians with a means to make informed  individualized treatment decisions based on genetic analysis of tumor tissues 
our pharmacogenomic analysis of clinical trial specimens for the pharmaceutical industry may provide data that will lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis for response to specific drugs and  therefore lead to individualized treatment 
we are focusing our efforts in the following areas commercialization of our responsedx tests  developing additional diagnostic tests for assessing the risk of cancer recurrence  prediction of chemotherapy response and tumor classification in cancer patients  and expanding our pharmacogenomic testing services business into and creating a standardized and integrated testing platform in the major markets of the healthcare industry  including outside of the united states 
our patented technologies enable us to reliably and consistently extract the nucleic acids rna and dna from tumor specimens that are stored as formalin fixed and paraffin embedded  or ffpe  specimens and thereby to analyze genetic information contained in these tissues 
this is significant because the majority of patients diagnosed with cancer have a tumor biopsy sample stored in paraffin  while only a small percentage of patients tumor specimens are frozen 
our technologies also enable us to use the ffpe patient biopsies for the development of diagnostic tests 
to our knowledge  we were the first company to generate clinically relevant information regarding the risks of recurrence of cancer or chemotherapy response using approximately  genes available from microarray profiling of ffpe specimens 
responsedx the outcome of cancer chemotherapy is highly variable due to genetic differences among patients 
some patients respond well with tumor shrinkage and increase in life span 
other patients do not obtain benefit from the same therapy but may still experience toxic side effects as well as delay in effective treatment and psychological trauma 
at present most chemotherapy regimens are administered without any pre selection of patients on the basis of their particular genetics 
however recent development of very sensitive molecular technologies has enabled researchers to identify and measure genetic and biochemical factors in patients tissues that can predict the probability of success or failure of many currently used anti cancer agents 
in order to increase the chances of a better chemotherapy outcome for cancer patients  we are developing genetic tests that will measure predictive factors for tumor response in tumor tissue samples 
we have begun offering tests for non small cell lung cancer nsclc responsedx lung and colorectal cancer crc responsedx colon patients tumor tissue through our laboratory located in los angeles  california  which is certified under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of clia  and we anticipate offering additional tests for esophageal  ovarian  gastric and pancreatic cancer in the future 
these tests are proprietary based tests which serve to help oncologists make optional therapeutic decisions for cancer patients 
the results from our tests can help oncologists choose among chemotherapy regimens to treat their cancer patients 
on september   we announced an exclusive agreement with neogenomics laboratories otcbb ngnm whereby neogenomics will offer our proprietary responsedx colon and responsedx lung tests nationwide 
under the terms of the agreement neogenomics will be the national exclusive clinical reference laboratory authorized to offer our proprietary tests through neogenomics national sales force and our newly formed sales team 
currently  our newly formed sales team was expanded to sales people located in the west coast  midwest  and east coast areas of the united states 
diagnostic tests for other cancers in addition to responsedx lung and responsedx colon  we are developing and intend to commercialize tests for other types of cancer that identify genetic profiles of tumors that are more aggressive and recur rapidly after surgery 
we also are identifying genetic profiles of tumors that are more or less responsive to a particular chemotherapy 
following the development of tests to predict the risk of recurrence after surgery  we intend to develop tests to determine the most active chemotherapy regimen for the individual patient at risk 
once developed and after obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals  we intend to leverage our relationships in the healthcare industry to market  sell or license these tests as a means for physicians to determine the courses of cancer treatment 
expansion of our pharmacogenomic testing services business we have started the expansion of our pharmacogenomic testing services business into major markets of the healthcare industry outside of the united states 
we have a service laboratory in japan  and are working to potentially establish a service laboratory in china  through collaboration with some of our current clients in the pharmaceutical industry 
the pharmaceutical industry is in need of standardized integrated worldwide analysis of clinical trial specimens 
it is important to the pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory agencies that the same analytical methods are used for each clinical trial sample around the world so that the data can be easily compared and used for global drug development 
also  export of clinical trial specimens to the united states is restricted from some areas of the world  such as china 
our goal is to offer an analysis of patient specimens and generate consistent data based on integrated common platforms and technology into the major markets of the healthcare industry including outside of the united states 
there are no assurances that we will be able to continue making our current responsedx tests available  or make additional responsedx tests available  will be able to develop and commercialize tests of other types of cancer  or will be able to expand our pharmacogenomic testing service business 
we anticipate that  over the next months  a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts will be focused on research and development to bring to market a series of diagnostic tests for cancer patients  to establish laboratories overseas in collaboration with certain of our current pharmaceutical clients  sales and marketing activities related to our responsedx diagnostic tests  and for other general corporate purposes 
research and development expenses represented and of our total operating expenses for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
major components of the  in research and development expenses for the year ended december  included supplies and reagents for our research activities  personnel costs  occupancy costs  equipment warranties and service  patent fees  stock based compensation and sample procurement costs 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are derived from services provided to pharmaceutical companies and from revenues generated from our responsedx tests 
revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the client or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from pharmaceutical company contracts are recorded on an accrual basis as the contractual obligations are completed and as a set of assays is processed through our laboratory under a specified contractual protocol 
certain contracts have minimum assay requirements that  if not met  result in payments that are due upon the completion of the designated period 
in these cases  revenues are recognized when the end of the specified contract period is reached 
on occasion  we may enter into a contract that requires the client to provide an advance payment for specimens that will be processed at a later date 
in these cases  we record this advance as deferred revenue and recognize the revenue as the specimens are processed or at the end of the contract period  as appropriate 
we recognize a portion of product revenue from our responsedx tests invoiced to medicare on an accrual basis and to third party payors  including private payors on a cash basis 
we have received our medicare provider number which allows us to invoice and collect from medicare 
our invoicing to medicare is primarily based on amounts allowed by medicare for the service provided as defined by common procedural terminology cpt codes 
we recognize revenue from third party and private payors currently on a cash basis until a collection history can be determined 
until we are reasonably assured about a pattern of collections we will continue to record revenues from third party payors of responsedx on a cash basis 
we continue to process samples for responsedx testing services 
currently we are processing more samples for responsedx testing services than revenue is being recorded 
this is primarily due to timing and recognition of revenue from third party payors until a collection history can be established 
we are subject to potentially significant variations in the timing of revenue recognized from period to period due to a variety of factors including the timing of when specimens are submitted to us for testing  and the specific terms  such as minimum assay requirements in any given period  advance payment requirements  and terms of agreements  as set forth in each contract we have with significant clients 
license fees we have licensed technology for the extraction of rna and dna from ffpe tumor specimens from usc in exchange for royalty fees on revenue generated by use of this technology 
these royalties are calculated as a fixed percentage of revenue that we generate from use of the technology licensed from usc 
total license fees due under the royalty agreement to usc were  and  for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we also maintain a non exclusive license to use roche s polymerase chain reaction pcr  homogenous pcr  and reverse transcription pcr processes 
we pay roche a fixed percentage royalty fee for revenue that we generate through use of certain applications of this technology 
royalties accrued under this agreement totaled  and  for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we are subject to potentially significant variations in royalties recorded in any period 
while the amount paid is based on a fixed percentage from revenues of specific tests pursuant to terms set forth in the agreements with usc and roche  the amount due is calculated based on the revenue we recognize using the respective licensed technology 
as discussed above  this revenue can vary from period to period as it is dependent on the timing of the specimens submitted by our clients for testing 
accounts receivable we invoice our pharmaceutical clients as specimens are processed and any other contractual obligations are met 
our contracts with pharmaceutical clients typically require payment within days of the date of invoice 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  client credit  current economic trends and changes in client payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
to date  our clients have primarily been large pharmaceutical companies 
as a result  bad debts to date have been minimal 
we generally bill medicare and third party payors for responsedx upon delivery of a report to the physician 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with medicare and third party payors 
as we continue to generate revenues from responsedx  we will monitor the collection history from third party payors 
until we are reasonably assured about a pattern of collections  we will continue to record revenues from third party payors of responsedx on a cash basis 
income taxes we estimate our tax liability through calculations we perform for the determination of our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our balance sheets 
our management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods through future operating results 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to adjust the net carrying value of such assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income  based on management s estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions take into consideration future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in determining recoverability of such assets 
our valuation allowance is subject to significant change based on management s estimates of future profitability and the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets 
results of operations years ended december  and december  revenues 
revenues were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the comparable period in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was generated primarily due to a delay in receipt of samples to be tested from our pharmaceutical clients which we expect to receive in and and a reduction in revenue from the fluorescent in situ hybridization  immunohistochemistry or ihc and bioinformatics services provided by us to our pharmaceutical company clients and a slowdown in the pharmaceutical services business due to the current economic environment 
combined revenue from fluorescent in situ hybridization  ihc and bioinformatics services provided by us decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by  in revenue associated with our new response dx assays which were not available in the year ended december  additionally  revenues from gsk bio increased  in as compared to this increase was offset by decreases from our clients taiho and gsk amounting to  and  respectively  in compared to for the year ended december   two of our clients  gsk and taiho  accounted for approximately of our revenue  as compared to approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in expenses associated with floursecent in situ hybridization processing and bioinformatics expenses of  and a  reduction in expenses associated with issuance of stock options to employees and consultants 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in reagents and lab supplies of  to support our pharmaceutical clients and our new responsedx assay 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in share based compensation related to stock options issued to employees and consultants of  a decrease in laboratory supplies and reagents of  and a decrease associated with an academic research collaboration of  we expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue work to develop additional aspects of our technology and to study diagnostic indicators for various forms of cancer 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the comparable period in  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted primarily from an increase of  in personnel expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing activities for our new responsedx assay  an increase in our advertising and business consulting expenses of  primarily related to our sales and marketing activities for our new responsedx assay  an increase of  in board of director fees compared to  in  an increase of  of stock based compensation related to issuance of stock options to some of our key employees  costs related to expenses in japan of  which did not exist in  an increase in royalties of  and an increase of  in insurance related expenses primarily related to directors and officers insurance 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a result of the need to hire additional administrative personnel and due to higher legal  accounting  compliance and related expenses associated with being a public company 
uk operating costs and uk impairment of property and equipment 
in december   we made the decision to increase the operational efficiency of the company by consolidating our uk operations with our us operations 
based on this decision we began implementation of a reduction of workforce pursuant to which we will close our uk testing facility and consolidate testing services in our laboratory facilities located in los angeles 
as a result of the implementation of the reduction of workforce management performed a recoverability test of the long lived assets located at the united kingdom testing facility 
based on the recoverability analysis performed  the company recorded a non cash charge for the impairment of long lived assets of million as of december  to write down the carrying value of the long lived assets to their estimated fair value of the fair value was estimated based upon offers received from third parties to purchase the long lived assets 
the operating costs related to our uk lab  which were previously included in general and administrative expenses  were approximately million for compared to million in interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december   compared with  for the same period in this  decrease was due to lower average cash balances and lower rates of return during the period ending december  interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  and  for the same period in the preceding year 
in the year ending december  this expense consisted primarily of a fixed amount on notes payable from our stockholders 
the notes payable and accrued interest related to these notes payable was converted into shares of our common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering 
income taxes as of december  and  a full valuation allowance has been recorded for the deferred tax assets since we do not believe the recoverability of the deferred income tax assets in the near future is more likely then not 
liquidity and capital resources we incurred net losses of  and  during the year ended december  and the year ended december   respectively 
since our inception in september  we have incurred cumulative losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we expect that our research and development  and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and  as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
we expect to use our capital to fund research and development and to make capital expenditures to keep pace with the expansion of our research and development programs and to scale up our commercial operations 
the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the progress of our product development  regulatory requirements  commercialization efforts  and the amount of cash used by operations 
we expect that we will continue to generate revenue through our pharmacogenomic testing services business provided to pharmaceutical companies  but these revenues are not guaranteed and are not expected to substantially offset the costs associated with our expansion efforts 
we lease office and laboratory space for our location in los angeles under noncancelable operating leases that expire through march additionally  in  the company entered into an agreement to lease office and laboratory space for our operations in scotland 
this is an operating lease which expires in march  as a result of the reduction in workforce implemented by the company on february   the company has extended its lease in scotland for one additional month in order to facilitate the winding down of our uk operations 
for additional information see note for additional information 
rent expense for our facilities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments aggregate to approximately  over the next two years through the expiration of the leases in following is a summary of recent events and the expected impact of these events may or have had on our liquidity and future realization of revenues 
on december   we amended and restated our master service agreement with glaxosmith kline  ltd 
gsk  a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer the gsk agreement 
pursuant to the amendment  the term of the gsk agreement has been extended for a two year period  with the option for the parties to extend the gsk agreement for additional one year periods  upon their mutual written agreement 
in addition  we will become a preferred provider to gsk and its affiliates of genetic testing services on a fee for service basis and  in anticipation of the services to be provided  gsk agreed to make a non refundable upfront payment of approximately  which was received on january  this payment may be credited against future work undertaken in the period beginning on january  and ending on december  on february   we implemented a reduction of workforce reduction of workforce pursuant to which we are closing our united kingdom testing facility to consolidate services at our clia certified laboratory facilities in los angeles 
pursuant to the reduction of workforce  we have eliminated all of our employees in the united kingdom  a total of positions 
the lease for our united kingdom testing facility is due to terminate on march  we have arranged to extend the lease  pursuant to its terms  for an additional month  in order to facilitate the winding down of our operations in the united kingdom 
the reduction of workforce will be substantially complete on march  we undertook the reduction of workforce as part of a strategic plan to increase operational efficiency in conjunction with our consolidation of our services at its los angeles facilities and it will not affect its genetic testing services or current partnership agreements 
in connection with the reduction of workforce  the company expects to incur expenses associated with one time termination benefits of approximately  the company had not satisfied all the criteria necessary in order to include those one time termination benefits in its december  financial statements 
those costs will be included in the company s financial statements 
additionally  management performed a recoverability test of the long lived assets located at the united kingdom testing facility in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on the recoverability analysis performed  the company recorded a non cash charge for the impairment of long lived assets of million as of december  to write down the carrying value of the long lived assets to their estimated fair value of the fair value was estimated based upon offers received from third parties to purchase the long lived assets 
on february   we entered into a purchase agreement the purchase agreement with certain affiliates of special situations funds the purchasers for the private placement of  newly issued shares of the company s common stock the shares at a per share price of the private placement 
the closing of the sale of the shares occurred on monday  march  in connection with the private placement  we also entered into a registration rights agreement  dated february   with the purchasers the registration rights agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to file  within days of the closing of the private placement  a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to register the shares for resale  which registration statement is required to become effective within days following the closing 
if the registration statement is not filed or declared effective within the timeframes set forth above  then we will be obligated to pay liquidated damages to the purchasers in an amount equal to of the aggregate amount invested by the purchasers for each day period  or pro rata for any portion thereof  following the date by which the registration statement should have been filed or declared effective 
in addition  liquidated damages will also accrue in the event that  subject to certain exceptions  we do not maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement until the earlier of the sale of all of the shares or the shares become eligible for sale under rule without regard to any volume limitations 
comparison of years ended december  and as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  working capital of  and an accumulated deficit of  cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended december   the company generated negative cash flows from operations of  compared to negative cash flows of  operations in the year ended december  the reasons for the change in cash flows of  was due mainly to the increase in net loss of  and in combination of a decrease in receivables  a decrease in prepaid expenses  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a decrease in accrued payroll  bonus and related liabilities  and a decrease in deferred revenue 
the decrease in accounts receivable  of  related mainly to one receivable for deferred revenue related to an amendment entered into in the fourth quarter of to the contract with gsk bio 
this amendment changed the company receiving monthly payments to a single advance payment amounting to million prior to december   which was not received until january  the decrease in deferred revenue of  related to a decrease in advance billings to our customers  along with recognition of deferred revenue totaling  the decrease in deferred revenue was offset with an increase of approximately million due to our amended and restated master service agreement with gsk completed on december  the decrease in prepaid expenses of  was primarily due to reductions in prepaid maintenance contracts partially offset by an increase in prepaid insurance 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily resulted from increased sales and marketing and business development activities related to the launch of response dx 
the change in accrued payroll  bonus and related liabilities is due to the decrease in bonuses granted and accrued as of december  of versus accrued bonuses of  as of december  cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  this decrease in the use of cash of  was attributable to reduced need for capital equipment in our laboratories 
cash flows used in financing activities there were no cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was  as a result of our initial public offering
