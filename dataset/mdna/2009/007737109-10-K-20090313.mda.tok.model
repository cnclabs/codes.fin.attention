item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company owns regional aircraft and engines  which are leased to customers under triple net operating leases 
the acquisition of such equipment is generally made using debt financing 
the company s profitability and cash flow are dependent in large part upon its ability to acquire equipment  obtain and maintain favorable lease rates on such equipment  and re lease or sell owned equipment that comes off lease 
the company is subject to the credit risk of its lessees  both as to collection of rental payments under its operating leases and as to performance by lessees of their obligations to maintain the equipment 
since lease rates for assets in the company s portfolio generally decline as the assets age  the company s ability to maintain revenue and earnings is primarily dependent upon the company s ability to acquire and lease additional aircraft 
the company s principal cash expenditures are for management fees  maintenance expense  financing interest payments  professional fees  insurance and  beginning in april  principal payments of the subordinated notes pursuant to an amortization schedule 
maintenance expenditures are incurred when aircraft or equipment are off lease  are being prepared for re lease  or require maintenance in excess of lease return conditions  as well as when maintenance work is performed in connection with the release of maintenance reserves previously received by the company from lessees 
see c 
maintenance reserves and accrued costs  below  regarding the company s accounting treatment of maintenance expenses 
the most significant non cash expenses include aircraft and equipment depreciation and impairment provisions  which are affected by significant estimates  and  beginning in the second quarter of  amortization of costs associated with the company s subordinated notes  which is included in interest expense 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the most critical accounting policies include the following aircraft capitalization and depreciation  impairment of long lived assets  maintenance reserves and accrued costs  accounting for income taxes  and revenue recognition and accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
a 
aircraft capitalization and depreciation the company s interests in aircraft and aircraft engines are recorded at cost  which includes acquisition costs 
since inception  the company has purchased only used aircraft 
it is the company s policy to hold aircraft for approximately twelve years unless market conditions dictate otherwise 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the twelve year period to an estimated residual value based on appraisal  which is adjusted periodically 
decreases in the market value of aircraft could not only affect the current value  discussed above  but could also affect the assumed residual value 
b 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews its portfolio of assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
such review includes estimating current market values  re lease rents  residual values and component values 
the estimates are based on currently available market data and third party appraisals and are subject to fluctuation from time to time 
the company initiates its review annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected undiscounted cash flows and if different conditions prevail  material write downs may occur 
during  the company recorded an impairment provision of  for one of its off lease aircraft based on the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the aircraft 
c 
maintenance reserves and accrued costs maintenance costs under the company s triple net operating leases are typically the responsibility of the lessees  and the majority of the company s leases require the payment of monthly maintenance reserves 
maintenance reserves and accrued costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes i refundable maintenance payments received from lessees  which are paid out as related maintenance is performed  ii for lessees who pay non refundable maintenance reserves  estimated maintenance costs accrued at the time a reimbursement claim or sufficient information is received regarding maintenance work performed  and iii maintenance for work performed for off lease aircraft  which is not related to the release of reserves received from lessees 
upon adoption of fsp aug air on january   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company was required to discontinue the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance for financial reporting periods beginning on january  the company evaluated the impact of the adoption of this new staff position and elected to use the direct expensing method  under which maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
under this method  non refundable maintenance reserves for planned major maintenance are reflected as income based on reported usage  if collectability is reasonably assured 
maintenance reserves are set by mutual agreement of the company and its lessee at inception of the lease and are based on the company s estimate of the total maintenance cost at some future point resulting from the lessee s usage 
reserve rates are typically subject to an annual adjustment provision that accounts for inflation of maintenance costs 
if a lessee is required to repair a component during the lease or perform a repair at lease end in order to comply with aircraft return conditions  it will be entitled to collect the reserves related to that repair from the company  and any excess costs would then be the responsibility of the lessee 
therefore  if maintenance rates do not accurately reflect the true cost of a repair  the company will not incur any financial impact 
if  however  the company repossesses an aircraft upon a lessee default  the company would incur expense for the entire cost of the maintenance  and if maintenance rates under the defaulted lease inaccurately reflect the costs of the lessee s usage  such costs would be in excess of collected reserves 
it is also possible that  in the case of a repossessed aircraft  in order to remarket the aircraft  certain inspections and repairs would need to be performed earlier than otherwise required by the manufacturer s or regulatory specifications and anticipated by the company 
in such a case  the collected reserves from the defaulted lessee  which were set assuming a normal interval between repairs  would likely be insufficient to cover the total cost incurred by the company 
d 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and gaap purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management must also assess the likelihood that the company s deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or changes the allowance in a period  the company reflects the corresponding increase or decrease in the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january   which prescribes treatment of unrecognized tax positions and requires measurement and disclosure of such amounts 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s future taxable income for purposes of assessing the company s ability to realize any benefit from its deferred taxes 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
e 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue from leasing of aircraft assets is recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
deferred rent is recorded when the cash rent received is lower than the straight line revenue recognized 
such receivables decrease over the term of the applicable leases 
non refundable maintenance reserves billed to lessees are accrued as maintenance reserves income based on aircraft usage 
in instances for which collectibility is not reasonably assured  the company recognizes revenue as cash payments are received 
the company estimates and charges to income a provision for bad debts based on its experience in the business and with each specific customer  the level of past due accounts  and its analysis of the lessees overall financial condition 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates  it could result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
results of operations a revenues operating lease revenue was  greater in compared to  primarily because of a  increase in operating lease revenue from aircraft purchased during and and re leases of several of the company s aircraft during and at increased rental rates 
the aggregate effect of these increases was partially offset by a decrease in revenue related to aircraft that were off lease for all or part of in the amount of  maintenance reserves revenue  comprised of non refundable reserves which are earned based on lessee aircraft usage  was  and  in and  respectively 
such income was  greater in compared to primarily as a result of the maintenance reserves increase related to aircraft acquisitions in gain on sale of aircraft and aircraft engines and other income included  of compensation in paid by a lessee for canceling a potential re lease transaction 
in  a gain of  for the sale of parts of a damaged engine was included in this item 
b expense items interest expense was  greater in compared to the company incurred  more in interest expense related to its credit facility and subordinated notes in than in as a result of a higher principal balances 
the company incurred  more of amortization expense as a result of a full year of subordinated notes fee amortization in compared to a partial year in during  the company recorded  of net settlement interest related to its interest rate swap compared to no such expense in the prior year 
the company also recorded a loss in fair value of  related to the interest rate swap compared to a  loss in the aggregate effect of these increases was partially offset by  less interest related to the company s credit facility debt in compared to as a result of lower average interest rates 
the company also recorded  less in unused commitment and renewal fees related to its credit facility  subordinated notes and special purpose financing debt in compared to primarily as a result of a lower average unused balances 
depreciation was  greater in compared to  primarily because of purchases of aircraft during and as a result of the company s sfas analysis as of december   the company recorded an impairment provision of  for one of its off lease aircraft based on the difference between the net book value and the fair value at that date 
the company recorded no such provisions in management fees  which are calculated on the net book value of the aircraft  were  greater in compared to because of higher net book values as a result of aircraft acquisitions 
the effects of this increase were partially offset by the effect of depreciation on the net book value of the company s aircraft 
the company s maintenance expense is dependent on the aggregate amount of maintenance incurred by lessees related to non refundable reserves and expenses incurred in connection with off lease aircraft 
in  the company recognized  more in maintenance expense than in  as a result of an increase in total lessee work incurred in  as well as an increase in expense related to off lease aircraft 
during and   and  respectively  of the company s maintenance expense was funded by non refundable maintenance reserves which were recorded as income when accrued 
the company records non income based sales  use  value added and franchise taxes as other tax expense 
such expenses were  lower in compared to based on the company s analysis of value added taxes related to an aircraft leased in australia  the company recorded value added taxes  penalties and interest totaling  in upon completion of further analysis and confirmation from the australian tax authority  the company reduced the accruals for such amounts in by  the company s insurance expense consists primarily of directors and officers insurance  as well as product liability insurance and insurance for off lease aircraft and aircraft engines  which varies depending on the type and length of time each off lease asset is insured 
aircraft insurance expense was  greater in compared to as a result of differences in the type of and length of time the insured assets were off lease 
the company s effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were approximately and  respectively 
the change in rate was the result of i recognition in of the effect of a difference for gaap and tax purposes in the valuation of warrants issued in connection with the company s issuance of the subordinated notes which increased the effective tax rate for and ii the company s recognition in of tax benefits associated with a decision to amend its tax returns to claim foreign tax credits rather than deduct foreign taxes for several prior years which lowered the effective rate for 
liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its assets primarily through debt borrowings  special purpose financing and excess cash flows 
a credit facility the company s credit facility  which is collateralized by all of the assets of aerocentury corp  expires on march  the current amount available under the credit facility is million and may be increased to a maximum of million 
during  the company borrowed  and repaid  of the outstanding principal under its credit facility 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility agreement   in principal amount was outstanding  interest of  was accrued and there was  of borrowing capacity remaining 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility agreement   in principal amount was outstanding  interest of  was accrued  and there was  in borrowing capacity remaining 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company pays a commitment fee based upon the applicable commitment fee rate on the unused portion of the credit facility 
commitment fees are expensed as incurred and paid quarterly in arrears 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants and  based on its current projections  the company believes it will continue to be in compliance with all covenants of its credit facility  but there can be no assurance of such compliance in the future 
see factors that may affect future results risks of debt financing and credit facility obligations  below 
the company s interest expense in connection with the credit facility generally increases and decreases with prevailing interest rates 
because aircraft owners seeking financing generally can obtain financing through either leasing transactions or traditional secured debt financings  prevailing interest rates are a significant factor in determining market lease rates  and market lease rates generally move up or down with prevailing interest rates  assuming supply and demand of the desired equipment remain constant 
however  because lease rates for the company s assets typically are fixed under existing leases  the company normally does not experience any positive or negative impact in revenue from changes in market lease rates due to interest rate changes until existing leases have terminated and new lease rates are set as aircraft are re leased 
as discussed in b below  the company entered into an interest rate swap in december b derivative instrument in december  the company entered into a two year interest rate swap the swap with a notional amount of million  under which it committed to make or receive a net settlement for the difference in interest receivable computed monthly on the basis of day libor and interest payable monthly on the basis of a fixed rate of per annum 
the swap is designed to limit exposure to interest rate increases on million of the company s credit facility debt by fixing the net interest payable over the term of the swap 
under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the company is required to recognize the fair value of the swap as an asset or liability at its fair value  which is based upon the amount the company would receive or pay to terminate its agreements at the reporting date  taking into account market conditions and the creditworthiness of the derivative counterparties 
because the swap does not qualify as a hedge  the value of the swap is marked to market at the end of each reporting period and changes in fair value of the swap are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as interest expense 
as such  at december  and  the company recorded the fair value of the swap of  and  respectively  as a liability on its consolidated balance sheet as a component of notes payable and accrued interest 
the company recorded a loss on the swap of  and  for and  respectively  as a component of interest expense 
the company also recognized additional interest expense on the net settlement of the swap of  in as a component of interest expense 
sfas no 
discusses valuation techniques  such as the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flow  and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
the statement utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the following is a brief description of those three levels level observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs  other than quoted prices  that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active 
level unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions 
the company s interest rate swap agreement effectively converts a portion of the company s short term variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
under this agreement  the company pays a fixed rate and receives a variable rate of libor 
the fair value of this interest rate derivative is based on quoted prices for similar instruments from a commercial bank and  therefore  the interest rate derivative is considered a level input in and c senior unsecured subordinated debt in april  the company entered into a securities purchase agreement the subordinated notes agreement  whereby the company would issue senior unsecured subordinated notes  with an aggregate principal amount of million to certain note purchasers 
the subordinated notes were to be issued at of the face amount and are due december  principal payments which fully amortize the balance of the subordinated notes are due beginning april  through december  in amounts necessary to cause i the balance of the subordinated notes and ii the ratio of total outstanding debt under the credit facility and subordinated notes compared to the discounted portfolio value to not exceed amounts specified in the securities notes agreement 
under the subordinated notes agreement  the holders of subordinated notes also were issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable for a four year period after the earliest of i a change of control  or ii the final maturity of the related subordinated notes  which is december  pursuant to an investors rights agreement  the warrants are subject to registration rights that require the company to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the shares issued upon exercise of the warrants on a registration statement filed with the sec 
in july  the company and the holders of subordinated notes agreed to amend the subordinated notes agreement to reduce the maximum amount of subordinated notes to be issued under the agreement from million to million and to reduce the number of shares of the company s common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued to the holders of subordinated notes under the subordinated notes agreement from  to  the estimated fair value of the warrants cancelled was  and was recorded as a reduction to paid in capital and debt discount 
the amendment also provided for the refund to the company of certain fees paid to the purchasers of subordinated notes at the initial closing of the subordinated notes agreement  as well as a portion of the unused commitment fees paid to the noteholders through june   and revised certain prepayment provisions of the subordinated notes agreement 
the amendment was accounted for as a debt modification 
the net proceeds from the  of subordinated notes that were issued pursuant to the amendment were used to repay a portion of the company s credit facility debt 
as of december   the carrying amount of the subordinated notes was approximately  outstanding principal amount of  less unamortized debt discount of approximately  and accrued interest payable was as of december   the carrying amount of the subordinated notes was approximately  outstanding principal amount of  less unamortized debt discount of approximately  and accrued interest payable was as of december  and  the company was in compliance with all covenants under the subordinated notes agreement 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants and  based on its current projections  the company believes it will continue to be in compliance with all covenants of its subordinated notes agreement  but there can be no assurance of such compliance in the future

d special purpose financings in september  a special purpose subsidiary acquired a dehavilland dhc aircraft using cash and bank financing separate from the credit facility 
the related note obligation  which was due april   was refinanced in april using bank financing from another lender  and the subsidiary was dissolved 
the aircraft was transferred to aerocentury vi llc  a newly formed special purpose limited liability company  which borrowed  due october  the note bears interest at an adjustable rate of one month libor plus 
the note is collateralized by the aircraft and the company s interest in aerocentury vi llc and is non recourse to aerocentury corp 
payments due under the note consist of monthly principal and interest through april   interest only from april  until the maturity date  and a balloon principal payment due on the maturity date 
during   of principal was repaid on the note 
the principal amount owed under the note at december  was  and interest of was accrued 
the principal amount owed under the note at december  was  and interest of  was accrued 
as of december  and  the company was in compliance with all covenants of this note obligation and is currently in compliance 
in november  the company refinanced two dhc aircraft that had been part of the collateral base for the credit facility 
the financing  which was provided by a bank by means separate from the credit facility  was provided to a newly formed special purpose subsidiary  aerocentury v llc  to which the aircraft were transferred 
the financing resulted in a note obligation in the amount of  due november   which accrued interest at the rate of 
the note was collateralized by the aircraft and the company s interest in aerocentury v llc and was non recourse to aerocentury corp 
payments due under the note consisted of monthly principal and interest through april  in april  the company repaid the outstanding principal of  owed by aerocentury v llc under its special purpose financing and paid a prepayment penalty of  in august  the company transferred ownership of the two aircraft that served as collateral for the financing from aerocentury v llc to aerocentury corp  at which time the aircraft became eligible as collateral under the credit facility 
the principal amount owed under the note at december  was  and interest of  was accrued 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants of this note obligation 
on august   aerocentury v llc was dissolved 
e future maturities of notes payable as of december   principal payments due under the company s credit facility  subordinated notes and special purpose financing were as follows less than one year years years after years f cash flow the company s primary source of cash is lease rentals of its aircraft assets 
currently  one of the company s fokker aircraft  its two saab a aircraft  one of its saab b aircraft and one turboprop engine are off lease  for which the company is not currently receiving rent income 
the company has and will continue to incur significant maintenance expense in order to prepare these aircraft for re lease 
ten of the company s leases expire in the company believes that it will be successful in extending the leases for a majority of the aircraft  given preliminary indications from current lessees 
the company s primary uses of cash are for management fees  maintenance expense  financing interest payments  professional fees  insurance and  beginning in april  principal payments of the subordinated notes pursuant to an amortization schedule 
the amount and timing of the company s maintenance expenditures are dependent on the aggregate amount of the maintenance claims submitted by lessees for reimbursement from reserves and expenses incurred in connection with off lease aircraft and preparation of such aircraft for re lease 
the amount of interest paid by the company is dependent on the outstanding balance of its credit facility  subordinated notes and special purpose financing debt 
in addition  the amount of interest expenditures related to the company s credit facility and special purpose financing debt are dependent on changes in prevailing interest rates 
management believes that the company will have adequate cash flow to meet its ongoing operational needs  including required repayments under its credit facility  subordinated notes financing and special purpose financings  based upon its estimates of future revenues and expenditures 
the company s expectations concerning such cash flows are based on existing lease terms and rents  as well as numerous estimates  including i rents on assets to be re leased  ii timely use of proceeds of unused debt capacity toward additional acquisitions of income producing assets  and iii the cost and anticipated timing of maintenance to be performed 
while the company believes that the assumptions it has made in forecasting its cash flow are reasonable in light of experience  actual results could deviate from such assumptions 
among the more significant external factors outside the company s control that could have an impact on the accuracy of cash flow assumptions are i an increase in interest rates that negatively affects the company s profitability and causes the company to violate covenants of its credit facility or its subordinated notes  which may in turn require repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility or the subordinated notes  ii lessee non performance or non compliance with lease obligations which may affect credit facility collateral limitations and subordinated notes covenants  as well as revenue and expenses  iii inability to locate and acquire a sufficient volume of additional aircraft assets at prices that will produce acceptable net returns  iv lessee performance of maintenance earlier than anticipated and v failure of the credit facility participants to fully fund their respective commitments 
i operating activities the company s cash flow from operations for the year ended december  compared to decreased by  the change in cash flow is a result of changes in several cash flow items during the year  including principally the following lease rents  maintenance reserves and security deposits payments received from lessees for rent were  greater in compared to  due primarily to rent payments for aircraft acquired during and  and re leases during and at increased rental rates for several of the company s aircraft 
the aggregate effect of these increases was partially offset by a decrease in revenue related to aircraft that were off lease for all or part of the period 
payments received for refundable and non refundable maintenance reserves are based on usage of the company s aircraft 
such payments were  greater in than in as a result of usage of the aircraft acquired in  the effect of which was partially offset by a net decrease in average lessee usage of other aircraft owned by the company 
during  the company returned a  security deposit to a lessee upon return of an aircraft at lease end and received  of deposits in connection with the re lease of one of the company s aircraft 
during  the company received  of security deposits in connection with aircraft purchased in and re leases of two aircraft and returned security deposits totaling  at the end of two leases 
sales proceeds and other income in  the company received  of compensation for a potential re lease transaction that was not consummated 
in  the company received  for the sale of parts of a damaged engine 
payments for interest payments for interest decreased by  in compared to the company paid  less interest related to the company s credit facility and special purpose financing debt in compared to this decrease was a result of the net effect of lower average index rates upon which the credit facility s and one of the special purpose financing interest rates were based  and higher average balances 
the company also paid  less in commitment fees related to the unused portion of its credit facility and subordinated notes debt and  less of credit facility renewal fees in compared to the aggregate effect of these decreases was partially offset by an increase of  in interest expense related to the company s subordinated notes in compared to as a result of a higher principal balance 
during  the company also recorded  of net settlement interest related to the swap 
payments for maintenance payments for maintenance were  greater in compared to as a result of increases in the amount of maintenance claims submitted by lessees in and the amount of maintenance for off lease aircraft 
the amount of payments for maintenance in future periods will be dependent on the amount and timing of maintenance paid from lessee maintenance reserves held by the company and maintenance paid for off lease aircraft 
payments for amounts accrued related to aircraft acquisitions and capital equipment additions during  the company paid  for amounts capitalized and accrued in related to aircraft acquisitions and capital equipment additions to aircraft owned by the company 
payments for management fees payments for management fees increased by  in compared to because of an overall higher net book value as a result of aircraft acquisitions in and payments for professional fees and general and administrative expenses payments for professional fees and general and administrative expenses increased by  in compared to primarily because of higher accounting and legal fees 
payments for aircraft insurance payments for aircraft insurance were  greater in compared to because the company had more aircraft off lease in the period 
income taxes federal and state income tax receipts net of payments were  higher in than in in  the company made payments of  for federal and state taxes and received a tax refund of  as a result of amending its and federal tax returns 
in  the company made payments of  for state taxes and received federal tax refunds of  as a result of amending its and federal tax returns 
ii investing activities during and  the company used cash of  and  respectively  for aircraft acquisitions and capital equipment installed on aircraft 
iii financing activities the company borrowed  and  for aircraft financing and repaid  and  of its outstanding debt in and  respectively 
the company also issued  and  of principal amount of subordinated notes in and  respectively  the net proceeds of which were used to repay a portion of the company s credit facility debt 
outlook because the global economy is in a significant downturn  the company anticipates that many air carriers will be forced to reduce capacity  which may negatively impact their needs for additional aircraft  which in turn may mean fewer leasing or sales opportunities for the company 
to date  except for the lease termination and payment deferral discussed below  the company has not experienced significant changes in any of its customers payment timeliness but has seen indications of a weakening in the financial condition and operating results of some customers 
the current tightening of the credit markets may create increased demand for sale leasebacks from carriers as a way to monetize owned assets  or from carriers that are proceeding with fleet expansion but are unable to obtain asset based acquisition loans 
the company therefore anticipates that there will be opportunities for acquisitions during  and that the available borrowing capacity under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund acquisitions projected for the company is currently seeking to re lease its two saab a aircraft and one fokker aircraft that are off lease 
one of the saab a aircraft has already had significant maintenance performed on it to ready it for remarketing 
maintenance on the second saab a aircraft  estimated to cost approximately  will not commence until a new lessee is identified 
the fokker aircraft was returned early by its lessee  which ceased operations in late maintenance reserves of approximately million previously collected from the lessee and previously recorded as income are being used to partially fund the work necessary to prepare the aircraft for re lease 
the repair work commenced in late  and the company recorded approximately million of expense through december  the remaining work will be recognized as expense when it is performed in the first half of total maintenance expense to prepare this aircraft for re lease is estimated to be million 
a current lessee of two of the company s aircraft and the company are currently negotiating a term sheet for the off lease fokker aircraft 
in january  the company terminated its lease for a saab b with an australian lessee due to payment default and other breaches under the lease 
the expiration date of the lease for this aircraft had been in march the company is likely to incur significant expense to repossess the aircraft and prepare it for remarketing during the lessee has ceased operations and is being wound up under its local insolvency laws 
the company will file a claim for its unpaid obligations and other expenses arising from the lessee s breach but does not anticipate a significant monetary recovery on such claim  as the company is an unsecured creditor and the lessee appears to have insufficient remaining assets to satisfy secured creditors who have priority over unsecured creditors in the liquidation 
this aircraft will require approximately million of maintenance to prepare it for re lease  but the company believes that it will be able to complete such maintenance and find a new customer for the aircraft during ten of the company s other aircraft leases expire in the company believes that it will be successful in extending the leases for a majority of these aircraft  given preliminary indications from current lessees 
if the aircraft that are currently off lease remain off lease for an extended period of time and the company is not successful in extending the leases for a majority of the ten aircraft with leases expiring in  the company may not be able to meet its operational needs or remain in compliance with the terms of its credit facility and subordinated notes 
although increased demand generally in the turboprop market has caused lease rates to stabilize and  in some cases  rise  there can be no assurance that rental rates on aircraft to be re leased will not decline  so that  absent additional acquisitions by the company beyond those made in and in  aggregate lease revenues for the current portfolio could decline in the future 
the company continually monitors the financial condition of its lessees to avoid unanticipated creditworthiness issues  and where necessary  works with lessees to ensure continued compliance with obligations under their respective leases 
currently  the company is closely monitoring the performance of three lessees with a total of seven aircraft under lease 
the company continues to work closely with these lessees to ensure compliance with their current obligations 
in february  the company and the lessee of two of the company s aircraft agreed to defer a portion of the rent and maintenance reserves due from the lessee 
the deferral is to be paid in four monthly installments beginning in march if any of the company s current lessees are unable to meet their lease payment obligations  the company s future operating results could be materially impacted 
any weakening in the aircraft industry may also affect the performance of lessees that currently appear to the company to be creditworthy 
see factors that may affect future results general economic conditions  below 
beginning on january   due to the adoption of fsp aug air  the company began to accrue non refundable maintenance reserves billed to lessees as income based on aircraft usage and record maintenance expenses as incurred 
the company accrues estimated maintenance costs based on information provided by its third party lessees and  accordingly  estimates of such expenses depend on timely and accurate reporting by such parties 
the company believes that its reported net income may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter as a result of the adoption of fsp aug air due to the recent acquisition of fokker jet engine powered aircraft  the magnitude of these fluctuations may be greater as a result of the higher maintenance reserve rates and related maintenance expense for jet engines as compared to turboprop engines 
factors that may affect future results availability of financing 
the company s continued growth will depend on its ability to obtain capital  either through debt or equity financings 
the financial markets have experienced certain setbacks related in many cases to certain financial institutions investments in mortgage backed securities 
as a result  commercial lending origination has dramatically decreased  and asset based debt financing is now more difficult to obtain 
the company believes that the current banking crisis will not have an immediate effect on the company 
the company believes the lenders in its credit facility will continue to be able to honor their commitment to provide loans as committed in the credit facility agreements and that the unused capacity under the credit facility provides sufficient capital to fund acquisitions through the end of the company  however  will eventually need to seek additional capital once its credit facility is fully drawn 
the company is currently seeking additional lenders for participation in its credit facility  and investigating other sources of debt financing 
there is no assurance that the company will succeed in finding such additional capital  and if such financing is found  it may not be on terms as favorable as its current debt financings 
the current term of the credit facility expires in march while the company anticipates that  at that time  the current lenders participating in the facility will remain as participants in the amount for which they are currently committed  there is no assurance that such will occur 
if one or more participants decides not to continue  then the company will either need to pay off such participant by obtaining additional commitment amounts from the remaining lenders  finding new replacement lenders  or selling assets  or doing a combination of any of the foregoing 
risks of debt financing 
the company s use of debt as the primary form of acquisition financing subjects the company to increased risks of leveraging 
indebtedness owed under the credit facility is secured by the company s existing assets as well as the specific assets acquired with each financing 
in addition to payment obligations  the credit facility also requires the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including a requirement of positive earnings  interest coverage and net worth ratios 
any default under the credit facility  if not waived by the lenders  could result in foreclosure upon not only the asset acquired using such financing  but also the existing assets of the company securing the loan 
any such default could also result in a cross default under the subordinated notes 
the addition of the subordinated notes  while providing additional resources for acquisition by the company of revenue generating assets  also had the effect of increasing the company s overall cost of capital  as they bear an effective overall interest rate that is currently higher than the rate payable under the credit facility 
the two tranches of subordinated notes financing started bearing interest immediately upon their issuance and  therefore  timely acquisition of income producing assets has become more critical to the company s financial results 
the agreement under which the subordinated notes were issued also contains financial and other covenants which  if violated  could cause a default under the subordinated notes 
credit facility obligations 
the company is obligated to make repayments of principal under the credit facility in order to maintain certain debt ratios with respect to its assets in the borrowing base 
assets that come off lease and remain off lease for a period of time  as well as assets with lease payments more than days past due  are excluded from the borrowing base 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash funds to make any payment that arises due to borrowing base limitations caused by assets scheduled to come off lease in the near term 
the company s belief is based on certain assumptions regarding renewal of existing leases  interest rates  profitability  lessee defaults or bankruptcies  and certain other matters that the company deems reasonable in light of its experience in the industry 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumptions will prove to be correct 
if the assumptions are incorrect for example  if an asset in the collateral base unexpectedly goes off lease for an extended period of time and the company has not obtained an applicable waiver or amendment of applicable covenants from its lenders to mitigate the situation  the company may have to sell a significant portion of its portfolio in order to maintain compliance with covenants or face default on its credit facility 
general economic conditions 
the company s business is dependent upon general economic conditions and the strength of the travel and transportation industry 
the industry is in a period of financial difficulty and contraction caused primarily by recent record high fuel prices and may be severely affected by the global downturn brought on by the ongoing credit crisis 
continuing unavailability of additional debt financing relied on by many regional carriers caused by the current credit crisis and a protracted economic downturn  which will certainly affect carriers revenue  may result in more failures 
a widespread economic setback in the industry may result in the increased possibility of an economic failure of one or more of the company s lessees 
if lessees experience financial difficulties  this could  in turn  affect the company s financial performance 
during periods of economic contraction  carriers generally reduce capacity in response to lower passenger loads  and as a result  there is a reduced demand for aircraft and a corresponding decrease in market lease rental rates and aircraft values 
this reduced market value for aircraft could affect the company s results if the market value of an asset or assets in the company s aircraft portfolio falls below carrying value  and the company determines that a write down of the value on the company s balance sheet is appropriate 
furthermore  as older leases expire and are replaced by lease renewals or re leases at decreasing lease rates  the lease revenue from the company s existing portfolio is likely to decline  with the magnitude of the decline dependent on the length of the downturn and the depth of the decline in market rents 
economic downturns can affect specific regions of the world exclusively 
as the company s portfolio is not entirely globally diversified  a localized downturn in one of the key regions in which the company leases aircraft could have a significant adverse impact on the company 
investment in new aircraft types 
the company has traditionally invested in a limited number of types of turboprop aircraft and engines 
while the company intends to continue to focus solely on regional aircraft and engines  the company has acquired fokker regional jet aircraft  and may continue to seek acquisition opportunities for new types and models of regional jet and turboprop aircraft and engines used in the company s targeted customer base of regional air carriers 
acquisition of other aircraft types and engines not previously acquired by the company entails greater ownership risk due to the company s lack of experience managing those aircraft and engine types 
the company believes  however  that the overall industry experience of jmc s personnel and its technical resources should permit the company to effectively manage such new aircraft types and engines 
further  the broadening of the asset types in the aircraft portfolio may have a benefit of diversifying the company s portfolio see factors that may affect future results concentration of lessees and aircraft type  below 
warrant issuance 
as part of the subordinated notes financing  as revised upon the second and final closing in july  the holders of subordinated notes hold warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock  which represents of the post exercise fully diluted capitalization of the company as of the initial closing of the subordinated notes financing 
the exercise price under the warrants is per share 
if the warrants to purchase shares are exercised at a time when the exercise price is less than the fair market value of the company s common stock  there would be dilution to the existing holders of common stock 
this dilution of the company s common stock could depress its trading price 
concentration of lessees and aircraft type 
currently  the company s five largest customers are located in mexico  antigua  norway  netherlands antilles and germany and currently account for approximately    and  respectively  of the company s monthly lease revenue 
a lease default by or collection problem with one or a combination of any of these significant customers could have a disproportionate negative impact on the company s financial results  and therefore  the company s operating results are especially sensitive to any negative developments with respect to these customers in terms of lease compliance or collection 
such concentration of lessee credit risk decreases as the company leases additional assets to new lessees 
currently  the company owns eight dhc  fourteen fokker and seven fokker aircraft  making these three aircraft types the dominant types in the portfolio and representing  and  respectively  of net book value 
as a result  a change in the desirability and availability of any of these types of aircraft  which would in turn affect valuations of such aircraft  would have a disproportionately large impact on the company s portfolio value 
such aircraft type concentration will diminish if the company acquires additional assets of other types 
conversely  acquisition of these types of aircraft will increase the company s risks related to its concentration of those aircraft types 
lessee credit risk 
if a customer defaults upon its lease obligations  the company may be limited in its ability to enforce remedies 
most of the company s lessees are small regional passenger airlines  which may be even more sensitive to airline industry market conditions than the major airlines 
as a result  the company s inability to collect rent under a lease or to repossess equipment in the event of a default by a lessee could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue 
if a lessee that is a certified us airline is in default under the lease and seeks protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  section of the bankruptcy code would automatically prevent the company from exercising any remedies for a period of days 
after the day period has passed  the lessee must agree to perform the obligations and cure any defaults  or the company will have the right to repossess the equipment 
this procedure under the bankruptcy code has been subject to significant litigation  however  and it is possible that the company s enforcement rights may be further adversely affected by a declaration of bankruptcy by a defaulting lessee 
most of the company s lessees are foreign and not subject to us bankruptcy laws but there may be similar applicable foreign bankruptcy debtor protection schemes available to foreign lessees 
leasing risks 
the company s successful negotiation of lease extensions  re leases and sales may be critical to its ability to achieve its financial objectives  and involves a number of risks 
demand for lease or purchase of the assets depends on the economic condition of the airline industry  which is  in turn  sensitive to general economic conditions 
the ability to remarket equipment at acceptable rates may depend on the demand and market values at the time of remarketing 
the company anticipates that the bulk of the equipment it acquires will be used aircraft equipment 
the market for used aircraft equipment is cyclical  and generally reflects economic conditions and the strength of the travel and transportation industry 
the demand for and value of many types of used aircraft in the recent past has been depressed by such factors as airline financial difficulties  increased fuel costs  the number of new aircraft on order and the number of aircraft coming off lease 
values may also increase for certain aircraft types that become desirable based on market conditions and changing airline capacity 
if the company were to purchase an aircraft during a period of increasing values  it would in turn need to lease such aircraft at a corresponding higher lease rate 
risks related to regional air carriers 
because the company s customer base is regional air carriers and the company continues to focus on regional carriers  it is subject to additional risks 
some of the lessees in the regional air carrier market are companies that are start up  low capital  low margin operations 
often  the success of such carriers is dependent upon contractual arrangements with major trunk carriers or franchises from governmental agencies that provide subsidies for operating essential air routes  both of which may be subject to termination or cancellation with short notice periods 
because of this exposure  the company typically is able to obtain generally higher lease rates from these types of lessees 
in the event of a business failure or bankruptcy of the lessee  the company can generally regain possession of its aircraft  but the aircraft could be in substantially worse condition than would be the case if the aircraft were returned in accordance with the lease provisions at lease expiration 
the company evaluates the credit risk of each lessee carefully  and attempts to obtain a third party guaranty  letters of credit or other credit enhancements  if it deems them necessary in addition to customary security deposits 
there is no assurance  however  that such enhancements will be available or that  if obtained  they will fully protect the company from losses resulting from a lessee default or bankruptcy 
also  a significant area of market growth is outside of the united states  where collection and enforcement are often more difficult and complicated than in the united states 
if any of the company s current or future lessees are unable to meet their lease obligations  the company s future results could be materially impacted 
interest rate risk 
the company s current credit facility and the indebtedness of its special purpose subsidiary carry a floating interest rate based upon short term interest rate indices 
lease rates typically  but not always  move with interest rates  but market demand for the asset also affects lease rates 
because lease rates are fixed at the origination of leases  interest rate changes during the term of a lease have no effect on existing lease payments 
therefore  if interest rates rise significantly  and there is relatively little lease origination by the company following such rate increases  the company could experience lower net income 
further  even if significant lease origination occurs following such rate increases  if the contemporaneous aircraft market forces result in lower or flat rental rates  the company could also experience lower net income 
in december  the company entered into the swap  a two year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  under which it committed to make or receive a net settlement for the difference in interest receivable computed monthly on the basis of day libor and interest payable monthly on the basis of a fixed rate of per annum 
the swap is designed to limit exposure to interest rate increases on million of the company s credit facility debt by fixing the net interest payable over the term of the swap 
nonetheless  if an interest rate increase were great enough  the company might not be able to generate sufficient lease revenue to meet its other interest payments and obligations and comply with the other covenants of its credit facility or indebtedness of one of its special purpose subsidiaries 
if the one month libor rate applicable for an interest period is below the fixed swap rate set in the swap contract  as has been the case in recent months  the company will be obligated to pay the swap counterparty the difference between the fixed swap rate of and that one month libor rate  resulting in a negative impact on the company s results 
as of march   the one month libor rate was 
international risks 
the company has focused on leases in overseas markets 
leases with foreign lessees  however  may present different risks than those with domestic lessees 
foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may be more or less protective of lessor rights than those which apply in the united states 
the company could experience collection or repossession problems related to the enforcement of its lease agreements under foreign local laws and remedies in foreign jurisdictions 
the protections potentially offered by section of the bankruptcy code do not apply to non us carriers  and applicable local law may not offer similar protections 
certain countries do not have a central registration or recording system with which to locally establish the company s interest in equipment and related leases 
this could make it more difficult for the company to recover an aircraft in the event of a default by a foreign lessee 
a lease with a foreign lessee is subject to risks related to the economy of the country or region in which such lessee is located  which may be weaker than the us economy 
a foreign economic downturn may impact a foreign lessee s ability to make lease payments  even though the us and other economies remain stable 
furthermore  foreign lessees are subject to risks related to currency conversion fluctuations 
although the company s current leases are all payable in us dollars  the company may agree in the future to leases that permit payment in foreign currency  which would subject such lease revenue to monetary risk due to currency fluctuations 
in addition  if the company undertakes certain obligations under a lease to contribute to a repair or improvement and if the work is performed in a foreign jurisdiction and paid for in foreign currency  currency fluctuations causing a weaker dollar between the time such agreement is made and the time payment for the work is made may result in an unanticipated increase in dollar cost for the company 
even with us dollar denominated lease payment provisions  the company could still be affected by a devaluation of the lessee s local currency that would make it more difficult for a lessee to meet its us dollar denominated lease payments  increasing the risk of default of that lessee  particularly if its revenue is primarily derived in the local currency 
finally  ownership of a leased asset operating in a foreign country and or by a foreign carrier may subject the company to additional tax liabilities that are not present with domestically operated aircraft 
depending on the jurisdiction  laws governing such tax liabilities may be complex or not well formed or not uniformly enforced 
in such jurisdictions  the company may decide to take an uncertain tax position based on the best advice of the local tax experts it engages  which position may be challenged by the taxing authority 
if the taxing authority later assesses a liability  the company may be required to pay penalties and interest on the assessed amount  which penalties and interest would not give rise to a corresponding foreign tax credit on the company s u 
s 
tax return 
reliance on jmc 
all management of the company is performed by jmc under a management agreement between the company and jmc  which is in the twelfth year of a year term and provides for an asset based management fee 
jmc is not a fiduciary to the company or its stockholders 
the company s board of directors the board has ultimate control and supervisory responsibility over all aspects of the company and owes fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders 
the board has no control over the internal operations of jmc  but the board does have the ability and responsibility to manage the company s relationship with jmc and the performance of jmc s obligations to the company under the management agreement  as it would have for any third party service provider to the company 
while jmc may not owe any fiduciary duties to the company by virtue of the management agreement  all of the officers of jmc are also officers of the company  and in that capacity owe fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders 
in addition  certain officers of the company hold significant ownership positions in the company and jhc  the parent company of jmc 
the management agreement may be terminated if jmc defaults on its obligations to the company 
however  the agreement provides for liquidated damages in the event of its wrongful termination by the company 
all of the officers of jmc are also officers of the company  and certain directors of the company are also directors of jmc 
consequently  the directors and officers of jmc may have a conflict of interest in the event of a dispute between the company and jmc 
although the company has taken steps to prevent conflicts of interest arising from such dual roles  such conflicts may still occur 
jmc has acted as the management company for two other aircraft portfolio owners  jetfleet iii  which raised approximately  in bond issuance proceeds  and aerocentury iv  inc aerocentury iv  which raised approximately  in bond issuance proceeds 
in the first quarter of  aerocentury iv defaulted on certain bond obligations 
in june  the indenture trustee for aerocentury iv s bondholders repossessed aerocentury iv s assets and took over management of aerocentury iv s remaining assets 
jetfleet iii defaulted on its bond obligation of  in may the indenture trustee for jetfleet iii bondholders repossessed jetfleet iii s unsold assets in late may ownership risks 
the company s portfolio is leased under operating leases  where the terms of the leases are less than the entire anticipated useful life of an asset 
the company s ability to recover its purchase investment in an asset subject to an operating lease is dependent upon the company s ability to profitably re lease or sell the asset after the expiration of the initial lease term 
some of the factors that have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell include worldwide economic conditions  general aircraft market conditions  regulatory changes that may make an asset s use more expensive or preclude use unless the asset is modified  changes in the supply or cost of aircraft equipment and technological developments which cause the asset to become obsolete 
if the company is unable to remarket its aircraft equipment on favorable terms when the operating leases for such equipment expire  the company s business  financial condition  cash flow  ability to service debt and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  a successful investment in an asset subject to an operating lease depends in part upon having the asset returned by the lessee in the condition as required under the lease 
in the ordinary course  a lessee has the obligation to return an aircraft to the company in the condition required under a lease  which generally requires the aircraft be returned in equal or better condition than that at delivery to the lessee 
if the lessee becomes insolvent during the term of its lease and the company has to repossess the aircraft from the lessee  it is unlikely that the lessee will have the financial ability to meet these return obligations 
thus upon repossession  the company will be required to expend its own resources to return the aircraft to a remarketable condition  and maintenance reserves collected from the lessee during the term of the lease may be insufficient to fund the total expense of such repair and maintenance 
furthermore  an asset impairment charge against the company s earnings may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse changes that impact the company s estimates of expected cash flows generated from such asset 
the company periodically reviews long term assets for impairment  in particular  when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the company may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of a prolonged weak economic environment  challenging market conditions in the airline industry or events related to particular lessees  assets or asset types 
several of the company s leases do not require the payment of monthly maintenance reserves  and if a repossession due to lessee default occurs with that lessee  the company may have to bear the entire cost of such repair and maintenance 
government regulation 
there are a number of areas in which government regulation may result in costs to the company 
these include aircraft registration  safety requirements  required equipment modifications  and aircraft noise requirements 
although it is contemplated that the burden and cost of complying with such requirements will fall primarily upon lessees of equipment  there can be no assurance that the cost will not fall on the company 
furthermore  future government regulations could cause the value of any non complying equipment owned by the company to decline substantially 
competition 
the aircraft leasing industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with aircraft manufacturers  distributors  airlines and other operators  equipment managers  leasing companies  equipment leasing programs  financial institutions and other parties engaged in leasing  managing or remarketing aircraft  many of which have significantly greater financial resources 
however  the company believes that it is competitive because of jmc s experience and operational efficiency in identifying and obtaining financing for the transaction types desired by regional air carriers 
this market segment  which is characterized by transaction sizes of less than million and lessee creditworthiness that may be strong  but generally unrated  is not well served by the company s larger competitors 
jmc has developed a reputation as a global participant in this segment of the market  and the company believes that jmc s reputation benefits the company 
there is  however  no assurance that competition from larger aircraft leasing companies will not increase significantly or that jmc s reputation will continue to be strong in this market segment 
casualties  insurance coverage 
the company  as owner of transportation equipment  may be named in a suit claiming damages for injuries or damage to property caused by its assets 
as a triple net lessor  the company is generally protected against such claims  since the lessee would be responsible for  insure against and indemnify the company for such claims 
further  some protection may be provided by the united states aviation act with respect to the company s aircraft assets 
it is  however  not clear to what extent such statutory protection would be available to the company  and the united states aviation act may not apply to aircraft operated in foreign countries 
also  although the company s leases generally require a lessee to insure against likely risks  there may be certain cases where the loss is not entirely covered by the lessee or its insurance 
though this is a remote possibility  an uninsured loss with respect to the equipment  or an insured loss for which insurance proceeds are inadequate  would result in a possible loss of invested capital in and any profits anticipated from  such equipment  as well as a potential claim directly against the company 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has been subject to fluctuations in response to the company s operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  the airline industry  changes in accounting principles or tax laws applicable to the company or its lessees  or other developments affecting the company  its customers or its competitors  some of which may be unrelated to the company s performance 
also  because the company has a relatively small capitalization of approximately million shares outstanding  there is a correspondingly limited amount of trading of the company s shares 
consequently  a single or small number of trades could result in a market fluctuation not related to any business or financial development concerning the company
