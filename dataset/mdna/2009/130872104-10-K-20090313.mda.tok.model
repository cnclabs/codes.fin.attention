our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors  and factors affecting operating results below  as well as those discussed elsewhere 
the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
overview caliper develops and sells innovative and enabling products and services to the life sciences research community  a customer base that includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and government and other not for profit research institutions 
we believe our integrated systems  consisting of instruments  software and reagents  our laboratory automation tools and our assay and discovery services enable researchers to better understand the basis for disease and more effectively discover safe and effective drugs 
our strategy is to transform drug discovery and development by offering technologies and services that ultimately enhance the ability to predict the effects that new drug candidates will have on humans 
our offerings leverage our extensive portfolio of molecular imaging  microfluidics  automation and liquid handling technologies  and scientific applications expertise to address key limitations in the drug discovery and development process namely  the complex and costly process to conceive of and bring a new drug to market 
we believe that increasing the clinical relevance of drug discovery experimentation  whether at early stage  lower cost  in vitro artificial environment testing or later stage  more expensive preclinical in vivo in a living organism testing  will have a profound impact in helping our customers to determine the ultimate likelihood of success of drugs in treating humans 
with enabling offerings in both the in vitro and in vivo testing arenas  and a unique strategy of enhancing the bridge or linkages between in vitro  in vivo and the clinic in order to optimize the cost of the experiment versus the clinical insight gained  we expect to continue to address growing  unmet needs in the market and drive on going demand for our products and services 
these market needs are underscored by key challenges that face the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  including late stage drug failures and unforeseen side effects coming to light late in the development process or even after drugs are on the market 
we presently offer an array of products and services  many based on highly enabling proprietary technologies that address critical experimental needs in drug discovery and preclinical development and related processes 
our technologies are also enabling for other life sciences applications beyond drug discovery  such as environmental related testing  and in applied markets such as agriculture and forensics 
we also believe that our technology platforms may be able to provide ease of use  cost and data quality benefits for certain in vitro and in vivo diagnostic applications 
we have multiple channels of distribution for our products direct to customers  indirect through our international network of distributors  through partnership channels under our caliper driven program and through joint marketing agreements 
through our direct and indirect channels  we sell products  services and complete system solutions  developed by us  to end customers 
our caliper driven program is core to our business strategy and complementary to our direct sales and distribution network activities  as it enables us to extend the commercial potential of our labchip and advanced 
table of contents liquid handling technologies into new industries and new applications with experienced commercial partners 
we also utilize joint marketing agreements to enable others to market and distribute our products 
by using direct and indirect distribution  and out licensing our technology under our caliper driven program  we seek to maximize penetration of our products and technologies into the marketplace and position caliper as a leader in the life sciences tools market 
key highlights during  we placed significant emphasis on our continued strategic transformation to higher growth  higher profit product lines 
in pursuing this objective  we further consolidated and streamlined our operations in order to both reduce costs as well as sharpen our focus on the core areas of our business 
key highlights of the year included product line divestitures on november   we completed  in two unrelated transactions  the sales of our pharmaceutical development and quality pdq and autotrace product lines 
the pdq product line was comprised of instruments used for drug content uniformity and dissolution rate testing and related services 
the purchase price paid to us was approximately million  including approximately million in cash together with certain assumed liabilities which are estimated at approximately million 
the autotrace product line was designed for water sample clean up by solid phase extraction prior to analysis of the sample for contamination 
the purchase price paid to us was approximately million in cash 
we recorded a gain of approximately million in related to these product line divestitures 
in addition to the benefit of the cash proceeds generated from the sales of these two business lines  we believe the narrowed product line focus on our remaining core technologies will improve our ability to become profitable 
business realignment during the third quarter of  we reorganized our various products and services along three core business areas optical molecular imaging imaging  discovery research research  and drug discovery services services or cdas which stands for caliper discovery alliances and services 
the imaging business is focused on preclinical imaging  where caliper holds a global leadership position in the high growth optical molecular imaging market 
principal activities of this business area include the expansion of the ivis imaging instrument and related reagent product lines  development of new therapeutic area applications and facilitating additional imaging modalities 
research is responsible for utilizing caliper s core automation and microfluidic technologies to address an expanding array of opportunities in drug discovery and life science research  including molecular biology sample preparation for genomics  proteomics  cellular screening and forensics 
cdas is responsible for expanding drug discovery collaborations and alliances  and increasing sales of drug discovery services 
the focus of cdas is to capitalize on market outsourcing trends and to maximize the large contract opportunity with the environmental protection agency under its toxcast screening program 
cost reduction initiatives over the course of  we completed several cost reduction initiatives to conserve our cash needs as well as increase productivity 
during the first quarter of  we approved and initiated the consolidation of our research and development operations into our alameda  california location  which was completed during the third quarter of this research and development consolidation was coupled with certain general and administrative streamlining actions  including the resolution of certain 
table of contents ongoing lawsuits 
also  in connection with the business realignment discussed above  we reduced our workforce  including the elimination of certain management positions 
the aggregate effect of cost reduction initiatives implemented in reduced our annualized operating expenses by approximately million and resulted in restructuring charges which totaled million 
in addition to these actions  leases related to previously closed facilities expired in june  which will result in annualized cash savings of approximately million 
summary gaap financial performance we achieved million of total revenue in  a decrease of from million of total revenue in the key elements of the decline were the substantial microfluidic license transactions and collaboration arrangements completed in which were non recurring by nature  the divestiture of two product lines pdq and autotrace in november  and reduced revenues within cdas related to our toxcast screening contract with the environmental protection agency and in vivo phenotyping and compound profiling service revenues from one customer 
offsetting these items were our key growth drivers in which were optical imaging product revenues  an increase in optical imaging license revenue  an increase in staccato automated workstations and zephyr liquid handling instrument sales  and the continued expansion of our microfluidic installed base  especially within the labchip gx and ez reader platforms 
on a pro forma basis  when excluding the product line divestitures and imaging licensing revenues which were reduced as a result of fair value purchase accounting  our total revenues of million in grew by compared to product gross margins decreased to in versus in primarily as a result of the increased material costs from the concentration of staccato automated workstation revenue as offset by the benefit due to increased volume 
service gross margins decreased to in from in due largely to the fixed cost base of our in vitro and in vivo facilities and the delay in timing of work within our in vivo services business  as well as an increase in the service costs  primarily headcount related  of the instrument services business  including costs of material 
operating expenses increased million in in comparison to  primarily due to the goodwill impairment of million and the restructuring charge related to the mountain view  california facility of million which are discussed below 
all other operating expenses decreased million in in comparison to this decrease resulted from reduced research and development spending of million as a result of our west coast consolidation and reduced funded collaboration work  and lower legal expenses including reduced litigation defense and settlement costs of million 
we also realized million of reduced expenses primarily through efforts to streamline operations and gain efficiencies through reduced headcount and spending  and as a result of a decrease in incentive compensation expense in other effects on operating expenses included a million reduction in amortization expense from the zymark intangibles that became fully amortized in july our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
with the sales of our pdq and autotrace product lines in november  we first determined the amount of goodwill that was to be allocated to these product groupings based upon their recent transaction values  and then applied our annual analysis see footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
as a result of our analysis we determined that the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the overall business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of million which was recorded in the fourth quarter 

table of contents during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our west coast consolidation and the related abandonment of approximately  square feet of space in mountain view  california 
we estimate that ongoing facility cash outflow  primarily rent payments net of sublease income  will be spread over the approximately years remaining on our mountain view  california lease 
we expect this initiative to result in lower expensed facility costs of approximately million per year 
net loss for was million  or per share  compared to net loss of million  or per share in the increase in net loss was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million 
performance trends and economic conditions the table below provides a reconciliation of our gaap basis revenue to pro forma revenue results for and  after giving effect to the divestures of the pdq and autotrace product lines which occurred in we believe this is a useful measure in evaluating revenue performance among comparative periods  but these non gaap comparisons are not intended to substitute for gaap financial measures 
year ended december  gaap non gaap adjustments non gaap gaap chg non gaap chg in thousands research imaging services cdas total revenue for purposes of comparing growth rates for each of the three principal areas of our business  the above non gaap table reconciliation excludes the following reflects elimination of certain collaboration related microfluidic license and contract revenue recognized during the year ended which were concluded in reflects elimination of the revenues related to the pdq and autotrace product lines divested in november reflects the add back of the deferred revenue adjustments recorded in purchase accounting that reduce revenues that would otherwise be recognized on a continuing gaap basis 
significant developments and trends among each of our key product families during included imaging in  cumulative placements of ivis imaging systems surpassed units  making  we believe  our ivis instrument one of the most successful platforms ever offered for pre clinical molecular imaging 
in  overall imaging revenues increased on a pro forma basis  including product and service growth 
we believe that there is continued market opportunity for this product line to grow  with instrument placements as well as expansion of the product line through aftermarket services and accessories  as well as reagents 
we believe the opportunity for this product line to grow is enabled by i continuing to expand beyond our historic core emphasis on oncology  to include therapeutic areas 
table of contents such as central nervous system disorders  infectious disease  inflammation and stem cell research  and ii extension of the product line to further detection modalities beyond bioluminescence and fluorescence detection through organic investment and acquisition 
research in  overall research revenues comprised of our microfluidics and automation product groups increased on a pro forma basis  when excluding revenues for the divested product lines and non recurring microfluidic contract and license revenues 
key factors were as follows microfluidics 
during  we experienced a decline in total microfluidics products and services revenue on a pro forma basis 
this decline was caused by a fall off in market demand for our labchip system and lost datapoint revenues from a single customer who is no longer in business  offset by increasing demand for our labchip gx instruments  which replaced the labchip in july  and our ez reader and profilerpro kinase profiling and reagent systems which replaced the labchip in our plans for and beyond are to capitalize on the successful consolidation of our west coast research and development resources in order to broaden the capabilities and market attractiveness of our microfluidics product offerings  an example being the launch of the labchip gx in  across both our direct and indirect distribution channels 
we are also exploring forensics and next generation sequencing sample preparation and molecular diagnostics as opportunities for longer term growth 
automation and liquid handling 
during  liquid handling and automation revenues increased on a pro forma basis 
the increase was driven by strong market demand for our core liquid handling offerings including staccato automated workstations and zephyr liquid handling instruments 
we see the markets for liquid handling and automation as mature and intensely competitive  however  we believe we can continue to achieve success in these areas in a number of ways 
we reorganized our sales and service teams during the third quarter of  to expand our focus on utilizing our core automation and microfluidic technologies to address expanding market opportunities such as molecular biology sample preparation for genomics  proteomics  and cellular screening and forensics 
cdas during  cdas service revenues decreased by approximately 
the decrease was balanced among both in vivo and in vitro services 
in vivo decreases resulted primarily from a decline in phenotyping and compound profiling services provided to one large pharmaceutical company  and in vitro services decreased as a result of reduced level of services requested by the epa in under the toxcast screening contract we were awarded in the goal of the toxcast screening program is for the epa to shift more of its agricultural chemicals testing toward in vitro analysis as opposed to animal testing 
this program has the potential to generate significant revenues over the next several years  however  the program is in its early beginning stages and relies on federal budget authorization 
overall economic outlook current economic conditions have led to an unprecedented level of uncertainty across industries  including the life sciences tools and services industry 
principal among concerns are that capital equipment and outsourced services budgets will be reduced and that companies will experience enhanced seasonality that could delay business to the second half of the calendar year 
coupled with these effects  the recent strengthening of the dollar in relation to certain currencies is expected to have an unfavorable impact on our reported revenues in versus if current exchange rates were to remain in effect over  we estimate that this would have a potential negative impact of approximately on our overall revenue growth 
on the positive side  we have introduced several 
table of contents potentially high impact products such as labchip gx  ivis kinetic and zephyr which are designed to benefit customers in the areas of genomics and molecular imaging  two fields in particular where research funding appears to remain strong 
in addition  we believe that we will see at least a partial rebound in epa task orders under the toxcast screening program in the recent american reinvestment and recovery act of stimulus package includes billion in incremental funding to the nih s annual budget 
while these funds are yet to be dispersed  we believe that we will achieve some level of benefit from the stimulus package directly or indirectly from government and academic labs which draw upon nih funding 
results of operations revenue year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands product revenue service revenue license fees and contract revenue total revenue product revenue 
product revenue increased during compared to  primarily due to strong imaging sales which increased by million  or  driven by ivis instrument growth  including an increase in instrument placements 
research product sales decreased million  or  during as compared to  primarily as a result of sales decreases caused by a weaker sales of non core focus products  including the pdq and autotrace product lines  which we divested in november which decreased by million in  b lower revenue from kinase screening labchip systems and ez reader instruments due to increased competition from kinase screening outsourcing  which decreased by million  and c overall decreases within our oem relationships and other research product lines which decreased by million  of which million was related to lost datapoint revenues from a single customer that is no longer in business 
offsetting these decreases within research were a strong sales in our automated sample preparation solutions led by sales of staccato automated workstations and zephyr liquid handling instruments  which increased by million  and b sales of labchip gx and gxii  our latest microfluidic benchtop instruments launched in mid for genomic sample preparation and analysis  which resulted in a million increase 
product revenue increased during compared to  primarily as a result of sales of optical imaging products which were added to our product portfolio as a result of our acquisition of xenogen in august overall  optical imaging products  which includes ivis imaging systems and related consumables and reagents  accounted for million of our increase in revenue in  and of total product revenue  with being the first full year of sales of this product line 
we had a increase in sales of ivis imaging systems in  compared to  including during the period in which xenogen was a standalone entity 
sales of microfluidic products  comprised of labchip instruments and chips  increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the key reasons for this improvement were the introduction of the ez reader kinase screening platform and associated profilerpro reagent kits in the first quarter of  and continued strong demand for the labchip automated electrophoresis system 
during we placed a total of new labchip systems with customers  which represented a increase in units sold compared to sales of liquid handling and automation products declined by million on a net 
table of contents basis overall  or  from million in to million in this decline was driven mainly by a substantial decrease of million in sales of liquid handling and automation products  primarily as a result of weakness experienced in oem sales and integrated staccato platform sales  which was partially offset by a million increase in sales of analytical instruments for drug development and other specialty applications 
we believe that the decline in liquid handling and automation product sales was due  in part  to temporary market conditions as evidenced by an increase in customer orders in our fiscal fourth quarter which led to a stronger ending backlog for such products at the end of in comparison to the end of in addition  during we introduced zephyr  a lower priced  desktop version of our sciclone liquid handler and have begun to see strong initial customer interest in this newer liquid handling product 
finally  in response to the decrease in oem product sales  we took steps to realign sales management and focus greater resources on the oem channel effective at the start of service revenue 
service revenue was flat during compared to  consisting of a million increase from instrument based services driven primarily by increases in the installed bases of ivis imaging and labchip microfluidic instruments  net of a million decrease from service revenues related to the pdq and autotrace product lines which were sold in the fourth quarter of and a million decrease in cdas service revenues 
the cdas revenue decline included the loss of million from a single customer contract that was not renewed in  a million decrease related to timing delays under a single contract with a particular customer in comparison to similar prior year revenues  and a million decrease under the epa toxcast screening contract in comparison to revenues 
the effects of these declines were partially offset by revenue increases from other cdas service platforms including imaging studies  transgenic animal production  and in vitro screening projects 
service revenue increased during compared to primarily as a result of in vivo drug discovery services performed by xenogen biosciences which became part of cdas in overall  the in vivo arm of cdas generated million of incremental service revenue for us in  adding to million of in vitro service revenue growth performed by our novascreen business unit  the majority of which resulted from the toxcast screening contract that we were awarded by the epa during in addition  we experienced a million increase in billable services and support contracts associated with our installed instrument base 
this increase was primarily driven by substantial new placements of ivis imaging systems in license fees and contract revenue 
license fees and contract revenue decreased during compared to primarily as a result of anticipated declines in both non recurring microfluidic license revenues of million and contract research collaboration revenue of million 
these declines were due to collaboration arrangements completed in  including related license revenues stemming from these arrangements 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in imaging license revenues of million during compared to the increase in imaging license revenue was due in part to favorable purchase accounting effects of million which resulted from contract renewals at full value versus the lower recorded fair value of such contracts pursuant to purchase accounting rules applied to the purchase of xenogen in license fees and contract revenue increased during compared to primarily as a result of million of optical imaging license revenue  and an increase of million in revenue from license rights granted under our microfluidic patent portfolio  the latter of which is not expected to be a material source of ongoing revenue beyond these sources of revenue were partially offset by a decrease in collaboration research revenue of million in as compared to and a decrease in certain government funded research projects of approximately million over this same period 

table of contents cost of revenue year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands cost of product revenue service revenue license revenue total cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue increased during primarily due to the overall increase in product sales 
the impact of increased revenues  however  was further affected by higher material costs which resulted from third party manufactured components which comprise staccato system sales which accounted for a substantial portion of the product revenue increase as discussed above 
material costs within cost of product revenue were approximately of sales in versus in  while other variable product costs were approximately of product sales versus in  reflecting increased inventory reserve allowance and other manufacturing variances 
offsetting these higher material and other variable costs was a million decrease in installation and product warranty labor costs compared to cost of product revenue increased during primarily due to the overall increase in product sales  including in particular sales of optical imaging products as discussed above 
material costs within cost of product revenue were approximately of sales in versus of sales in  reflecting improvement related to strategic sourcing initiatives while other variable product costs were approximately of product sales versus in reflecting primarily increased sales subject to third party royalties and incremental inventory reserve allowances due to parts made obsolete by recent product introductions 
overall labor and manufacturing overhead decreased by approximately million  from million or of sales in  to million  or of sales in leading to overall product gross margin percentage improvement  as discussed below 
the labor and overhead spending reductions resulted primarily from indirect labor cost reductions implemented in our hopkinton  massachusetts manufacturing plant during and reduced warranty support labor 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue increased during as compared to primarily related to increases in facility costs of our cdas businesses which increased by million over as a result of the renewal of leases in both our cranbury  new jersey and hanover  maryland locations  coupled with an expansion of space in hanover 
in addition  an increase in project materials spending accounted for an additional million of the overall increase 
beyond these factors  the remaining increase is driven by the allocation of resources to support instrument driven service revenues service contracts  billables and training due in large part to the increase in the installed base of ivis imaging and micro fluidic instruments being serviced 
cost of service revenue increased during compared to primarily due to having a full year of xenogen biosciences within our cdas operations which caused service costs to increase by million 
also within cdas  novascreen s service costs increased by approximately million during compared to as a result of increased staffing and material costs primarily associated with the epa toxcast screening program 
in addition to these primary increases  labor and other costs related to billable services and support contracts associated with our installed instrument base increased by approximately million worldwide 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue  which is comprised of sublicense fees and royalty payments  decreased during compared to primarily as a result of the substantial 
table of contents microfluidic revenue decline discussed above 
the cost of license revenue increase during as compared to incorporated the first full year impact of royalties due to stanford university on the basis of our imaging license revenues  together with all other pre existing royalties and license arrangements with certain other third parties from whom we in license technologies 
gross margins 
product gross margins decreased to  from in  despite the overall increase in product revenues and a million reduction in manufacturing spending as noted in cost of revenues above 
the primary reason for this decrease was the mix of revenues  which featured  for example  a greater percentage of sales from staccato automated workstations compared to  which carried a much higher material cost content 
gross margin on service revenue was for and for approximately basis points of the decrease in service margin resulted primarily from higher facility costs and project material costs within cdas  and the effect of lower revenues in relation to fixed spending levels as a result of certain contract delays that resulted during the year 
the remaining decline in service gross margin was driven by an increase of labor and material costs incurred related to instrument service revenues 
gross margin on product revenue was for  as compared to in which was a result of the combined effects of reduced manufacturing labor and overhead costs in relation to higher sales volumes as described above 
gross margin on service revenue was for and for this modest improvement reflected improved productivity leverage achieved at cdas in vitro operations related to the epa toxcast contract  partially offset by lower gross margins associated with cdas in vivo drug discovery service revenues 
in relation to service revenue  cdas in vivo operations cost structure is comparably higher than our historic service cost structure prior to our acquisition of xenogen  thus weighing down our service gross margins when compared to historic periods

research and development spending decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in these cost reductions were the result of reduced spending related to microfluidic collaboration projects that ended in  savings from cost reduction initiatives implemented in the second quarter of  and the consolidation of our west coast research and development operations in the first quarter of the overall net decrease was comprised of cost reductions including million in personnel related costs  million in material and operating supplies  million in allocated facility and information technology costs  and million of all other costs  which were partially offset by million of severance charges 
we continue to evaluate research and development spending based on anticipated revenues and market opportunities 
research and development spending increased by million  net  in versus this increase consisted of a number of changes in spending  including the following a million reduction 
table of contents for in process research and development projects acquired from xenogen in that were completed by us in  a million overall decrease in liquid handling and microfluidics project spending consisting of million in reduced labor related costs  million in reduced material and operating supplies and million of reduction in all other costs  and a million increase in optical imaging research and development costs consisting primarily of approximately million in increased labor related costs  million in increased facilities related costs as a result of a full year of xenogen s operations and million of increase in all other costs 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development spending to generally decrease in the future  to the extent our revenues continue to grow  and as we continue to closely manage discretionary spending on research programs with attractive commercial potential 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily general and administration related million and included million reduction of litigation costs related to a settlement charge incurred in and paid in  a million reduction in litigation defense costs which included million of proceeds from a mediated settlement in our favor  a million reduction related to legal and advisory services related to merger and acquisition activities in  a million reduction in personnel related costs due to headcount reductions  a million reduction in sfas r stock compensation expense  and a decrease in all other general and administrative costs of million 
in addition to the foregoing  selling and marketing expenses decreased by million during primarily due to the decrease in sfas r stock compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million during compared to primarily due to the full year results of xenogen included in our operations 
in general  costs and expenses were affected by the integration of xenogen s business with our ongoing operations as follows 
sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million due to the full year impact of  on average  approximately additional sales and marketing employees and million in increased legal expenses 
the remaining increase of million related primarily to sales and marketing expenses of million and million in general and administrative costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from million of labor related expenses including a reallocation of existing personnel resources from other areas of the business  million of legal spending for litigation and other legal costs  million of sales and marketing related expenses  million of legal and advisory services related to merger and acquisition activity  million of increased provision for doubtful accounts  and million of other costs  offset by a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense 
impairment of goodwill 
we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill to determine if impairment exists  and may perform a test for the impairment of goodwill more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
with the sales of our pdq and autotrace product lines in the fourth quarter  we first determined the amount of goodwill that was to be allocated to these product groupings based upon their recent transaction values  and then applied our annual analysis which resulted in the determination that impairment had occurred 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved our calculating the implied goodwill for the entity 
the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to the overall business exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill resulting in a goodwill impairment of million 
the goodwill impairment charge is non cash in nature and does not affect our liquidity  cash flows from operating activities  or debt covenants 
no impairment was identified in fiscal years and the goodwill impairment assessment is more fully discussed in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  related to assets acquired with our acquisitions of zymark  novascreen and xenogen 
amortization is computed based upon the estimated timing of the undiscounted cash flows used to value each respective asset over the estimated useful life of the particular intangible asset  or using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset when the pattern of cash flows is not necessarily reflective of the true consumption rate of the particular intangible asset 
the decrease in amortization during is related to the fact that the zymark intangibles were amortized as of july  the increase in relates to the acquisition of xenogen in and the inclusion of the related amortization for a full year 
amortization expense in included a charge of million related to the impairment of certain intangible assets established with the acquisition of novascreen 
the charge consisted of  related to the novascreen trade name and  related to government grants and contracts  each of which was written off during the fourth quarter of the charge for the trade name relates to caliper s decision to combine its drug discovery screening and profiling services for both in vitro and in vivo research under a new trade name  caliper discovery and alliance services 
the charge for government contracts and grants resulted from a relative lack of success in obtaining new sources of government research and development funding  due to increased competition for funding 
restructuring charges  net 
we incurred restructuring charges in  and related to acquisition and integration activities that are more fully discussed in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
restructuring charges during related to recording a restructuring charge of million related to the west coast consolidation which included a million charge in the third quarter along with a revision to the sublease assumption of million during the fourth quarter based on the deteriorating sublease market in mountain view  california  and the related abandonment of approximately  square feet of space in mountain view  california 
we estimate that ongoing facility related cash outflow  primarily rent payments net of sublease income  will be spread over the years remaining on our mountain view  california lease 
this facility closure has been accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 pursuant to which we have recorded a liability equal to the fair value of the remaining lease payments  net of expected sublease payments  as of the cease use date 
we expect this initiative to result in lower expensed facility costs of approximately million per year 
restructuring charges during related to accretion of interest on facilities  net of sub lease income 
restructuring charges during relate to a charge for increased operating costs on idle facilities and accretion of interest on facilities  net of sub lease income

during  we incurred foreign currency transaction gains of approximately  compared to  in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term restricted cash in addition to approximately million of additional borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility upon which we had outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letter of credit reserves of approximately million 
our credit facility  which was amended and restated on march  provides for up to million of available borrowing as further described below 
on march   we entered into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement the credit facility with a bank  which permits us to borrow up to million in the form of revolving loan advances  including up to million in the form of letters of credit and other contingent reserves 
principal borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a floating annual rate equal to the prime rate plus one percent if our unrestricted cash held at the bank exceeds or is equal to million  or prime plus two percent if our unrestricted cash held at the bank is below million 
under the credit facility  we are permitted to borrow up to million  subject to a borrowing base limit consisting of a of eligible accounts receivable plus b the lesser of of our unrestricted cash at the bank or million  provided  that on each of the first three business days and each of the last three business days of each fiscal quarter  the borrowing base is a of eligible accounts receivable plus b the lesser of of our unrestricted cash at the bank or million 
eligible accounts receivable do not include internationally billed receivables  unbilled receivables  and receivables aged over days from invoice date 
the credit facility matures on november  as of december   million was outstanding under the previous credit facility 
the credit facility serves as a source of capital for ongoing operations and working capital needs 
the credit facility includes traditional lending and reporting covenants including that certain financial covenants applicable to liquidity and earnings are to be maintained by us and tested as of the last day of each quarter 
the credit facility also includes a net liquidity clause 
under this clause if our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held at the bank  net of debt outstanding under the credit facility  is less than million  then the bank will apply all of our accounts receivable 
table of contents collections  received within our lockbox arrangement with the bank  to the outstanding principal 
such amounts are eligible to be re borrowed by us subject to the borrowing base limit described above 
based on our current forecast  we expect that we will operate under the net liquidity clause beginning in the third quarter of and continue in effect for the remainder of as of december   we were not in compliance with one of our covenants for which we subsequently received a waiver from the bank 
we expect to remain in compliance with the covenants through the credit facility s maturity date based on current forecasts 
the credit facility also includes subjective rights for the bank to accelerate the maturity date of the debt  lower the borrowing base or stop making advances  which are typical within asset based lending arrangements 
we do not believe the bank will exercise these rights as long as we are meeting our covenants and are achieving our forecasts 
the credit facility also includes several potential events of default such as payment default  material adverse change conditions and insolvency conditions that could cause interest to be charged at the interest rate in effect as of the date of default plus two percentage points  or in the event of any uncured events of default including non compliance with liquidity and earnings financial covenants  could result in the bank s right to declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable  to modify the borrowing base formula described above to reduce credit availability  or to cease making advances to us 
should an event of default occur  including the exercise of a material adverse change condition  and based on such default the bank were to decide to either i declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable  ii reduce our borrowing base  or iii stop making credit advances to us  we may be required to significantly reduce our costs and expenses  sell additional equity or debt securities  or restructure portions of our business which could involve the sale of certain assets 
we believe  based on our current projections that the bank will continue to lend to us subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
furthermore  additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in this circumstance  if we could not significantly reduce our costs and expenses  obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms when such financing is required or restructure portions of our business  our business would be adversely affected 
in addition  the amount of available capital that we are able to access under the credit facility at any particular time is dependent upon the borrowing base formula  which ultimately relies on the underlying performance of the business 
if economic conditions worsen and our business performance is not as strong as anticipated  then we could experience an event of default or a reduction in borrowing capacity under the credit facility  which if not cured to the bank s satisfaction  could have a potential adverse impact on our ability to access capital under our credit facility in order to fund operations 
if such events were to occur  our business would be adversely affected 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing  and financing activities 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in businesses  product development  restructured facility obligations  and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our credit facility 
significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by  among other factors  a decrease in demand for our products  our ability to integrate acquisitions  deterioration in certain financial ratios  and market changes in general 
we believe our cash balance  working capital on hand at december  and access to available capital under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund continuing operations through at least january  nevertheless  our actual cash needs could vary considerably  depending on opportunities and circumstances that arise over time 
if  at any time  cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to reduce our costs and expenses  sell additional equity or debt securities or draw down on our current credit facility if we have borrowing 
table of contents capacity 
the inability to obtain additional financing may force other actions such as the sale of certain assets  or  ultimately  cause us to cease operations 
on november   we filed  and the securities and exchange commission subsequently declared effective  a universal shelf registration statement on form s that will permit us to raise up to million of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants or units  either individually or in units  as described by the prospectus 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
furthermore  additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that we will be successful in these endeavors 
we maintain cash balances in many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences 
however  these cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have transferred  and will continue to transfer  cash from our subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
cash flows year ended december  change year ended december  change year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
in we used million of cash for operating activities which included million of net cash used to fund daily operations 
this usage included approximately million in personnel severance costs related to cost reduction initiatives 
in addition  we made a payment of approximately million on idle leased space in mountain view  california and incurred approximately million in net litigation costs 
investing activities 
during  net proceeds from the sale of the pdq and autotrace product lines generated million of cash and the refund of a security deposit on one of our facilities provided million 
purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities generated million of cash  which we used primarily for operations 
our primary investing activities were the purchases of million of property and equipment which mainly consisted of leasehold improvements within our current facilities 
financing activities 
during  financing cash proceeds were principally comprised of million of net borrowings under our credit facility 
other proceeds were from stock proceeds realized from employee participation in our employee stock purchase plan and option exercises 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   we had commitments under leases and other contractual obligations as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years borrowings under credit facility operating lease obligations idle facility obligations total obligations in addition to the commitments in the table above  as of december   we had a non cancelable purchase commitment in the amount of approximately million with the foreign supplier of our glass stock used in the manufacturing of certain types of chips and approximately million with our suppliers of cameras and filters for in vivo imaging instrumentation 
these commitments are excluded from the above table due to the fact they are not specifically related to a given time period 
we also have minimum royalty obligations under separate license agreements with ut battelle  llc  the trustees of the university of pennsylvania  monogram biosciences  inc  and certain other licensors that in the aggregate are approximately million per year 
as of december   we have established million in standby letters of credit  which restrict available borrowing under our credit facility  related to facility leases and customer deposits 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  and acquisitions 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continuing our research and development efforts  expanding our support and product development activities  and for other general corporate activities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued market acceptance of our microfluidic and lab automation products  and the demand for our services  the magnitude and scope of our research and product development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within our control 
financial projections our revenue projection for the first quarter of is to million 
the midpoint of this range is approximately flat compared to pro forma first quarter revenue in  and assumes an unfavorable currency effect of approximately at current exchange rates 
for the full year  we are currently estimating revenue growth of between over pro forma revenue of million 
our full year estimate assumes an unfavorable currency effect of based on current rates 
as previously communicated  growth is expected to be greater in the second half of than in the first half  and is expected to result primarily from our proprietary imaging and microfluidic technologies for molecular applications 

table of contents the financial projections that we have provided above are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and are only made as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
these projections are based upon assumptions that we have made and believe to be reasonable 
however  actual results may vary significantly from these projections due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business as described in item a  risk factors

critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
we use estimates when accounting for certain items such as warranty expense  sales and marketing programs  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  and valuations of investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to changing conditions or the validity of our assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  we allocate the consideration among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and consider the applicable revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
we determine fair value of undelivered items based upon our historic selling prices  or where no historic information exists  based upon management s estimate of the probable selling prices for such undelivered items 
the amount of our product revenue is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether there is objective evidence of fair value for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
these conditions are sometimes subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
we recognize certain service and contract revenue for certain arrangements based upon proportional performance which requires that we estimate resources required to perform the work 
the extent to which our resource estimates prove to be inaccurate could affect the timing of the revenue recognition for a particular contract arrangement 
goodwill 
we perform an annual impairment analysis of goodwill to determine if impairment exists 
we may perform a test for the impairment of goodwill more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
caliper is comprised of a single segment which is our sole reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired 
however  if the carrying value exceeds 
table of contents estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
fair value is determined by utilizing information about our company as well as publicly available industry information 
determining fair value involves judgments by our management and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including point in time estimates of revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  perpetuity growth rates  future capital expenditures and future market conditions  among others 
our projections are based on an internal strategic review 
key assumptions  strategies  opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment 
the second step of the goodwill impairment process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner that is similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
in determining the fair value of net assets we determined the fair value of leases and certain intangible assets  including trademarks  patents  core and developed technologies and customer relationships 
our annual goodwill impairment assessment has historically been completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
with the contemporaneous sales of our pdq and autotrace product lines in the fourth quarter of  which met the criteria for assets held for sale in october  prior to our goodwill impairment test date  we first determined the amount of goodwill million that was to be allocated to these product groupings based upon their recent transaction values  and then applied our annual analysis to the remaining goodwill balance million  which resulted in the determination that impairment had occurred 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involved us calculating the implied goodwill 
the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill  resulting in a goodwill impairment of million  which has been recorded in our results of operations in the fourth quarter of goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
the results of this year s impairment test are as of a point in time 
if the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated and or our market capitalization declines  this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value in subsequent years 
to the extent goodwill is impaired  its carrying value will be further written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings 
such an impairment charge would materially and adversely affect our gaap reported operating results 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of million in our consolidated balance sheet 
the goodwill impairment charge is non cash in nature and does not affect caliper s liquidity  cash flows from operating activities  or debt covenants  or have any impact on future operations 
no impairment was identified in fiscal years and valuation of intangibles 
our business acquisitions have resulted in intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization of million as of december  the determination of the value of such assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we acquired xenogen on august  in connection with this acquisition we used an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of intangibles related to the xenogen business 
the fair value was determined based upon projected future discounted cash flows of identified intangible assets taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of developed technology 
the valuation approach took into consideration discount rates commensurate with the inherent risk and projected 
table of contents financial results associated with each identified intangible asset 
applicable discount rates used ranged from to 
we acquired novascreen on october  in connection with this acquisition we used an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of intangibles related to the novascreen business 
the fair value was determined based upon projected future discounted cash flows of identified intangible assets taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of developed technology 
the valuation approach took into consideration discount rates commensurate with the inherent risk and projected financial results associated with each identified intangible asset 
applicable discount rates used ranged from to 
impairment 
we review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we perform the recoverability measurement and estimate undiscounted cash flows at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate the resulting impairment charge to be recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
actual cash flows could vary from the assumptions used in our assessment which could require future adjustments to our valuation of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense  based on their fair values 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using a black scholes merton based option pricing model 
various assumptions are used in these estimations  including expected volatility  which is based on historical volatility of our stock and warrants  expected option term  which is based on our historical option exercise data taking into consideration the exercise patterns of the option holders during the option s life  risk free interest rate  based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant  and forfeiture rate 
a unfavorable change in expected volatility and option term  which represent the most sensitive and judgmental assumptions  would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
accounts receivable reserves 
we grant credit to customers based on evaluations of their financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
we attempt to limit credit risk by monitoring our exposure for credit losses 
this analysis may involve review of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
we establish allowances for those accounts considered uncollectible based on the analysis of the recoverability of our trade accounts receivable performed at the end of each reporting period 
establishing an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts involves the use of considerable judgment and subjectivity 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to estimate the adequacy of our accounts receivable reserves which could require future adjustment to our reserve provisions 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  and million as of december  and  respectively 
we wrote off   and  of accounts deemed uncollectible in  and  respectively 
the write 
table of contents off in relates to a distributor of our pdq product line 
the amount of the write off was fully reserved in prior years and was written off in as it was deemed uncollectible 
inventory reserves 
we reserve or write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excess 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using management s best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
we use a twelve month demand forecast and  in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be impacted by engineering changes  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
determination of the excess balance is highly subjective and relies in part on the accuracy of our forecasts and our assessment of market conditions 
if actual conditions are less favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  additional write downs may be required 
conversely  if conditions are more favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations in that period 
during  and  respectively  we recorded charges of million  million  and million  to cost of product revenues for excess and obsolete inventories 
the and increases in excess and obsolete inventories occurred primarily as a result of product evolution and new product introductions 
warranty provision 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
we offer a one year limited warranty on instrumentation products and a day warranty on chips  which is included in the sales price of many of its products 
our standard limited warranty covers repair or replacement of defective goods  a preventative maintenance visit on certain products  and telephone based technical support 
no upgrades are included in the standard warranty 
provision is made for estimated future warranty costs at the time of sale 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary 
during  and  respectively  we recorded charges of million  million and million to cost of product revenues for estimated warranty costs 
the increase in relates primarily to the increase in product sales of liquid handling and automation products 
the decrease in relates primarily to the overall decrease in sales of liquid handling and automation products  especially staccato and labchip sales that are no longer under warranty that have historically incurred a higher rate of warranty incidents 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to establish the warranty liability which could require future adjustments to our reserve positions 
restructuring charges 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded restructuring charges of million  million and million  respectively  for exit plan activities which took place in the period and accounted for these plans in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment 
in accordance with such standards  management makes certain judgmental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
for example  the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates including with respect to contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  and ability of the tenant to pay leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sublease income 
we review on at least a quarterly basis our sublease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a 
table of contents sub tenant and the timing of the sublease arrangement 
if the rental markets change  our sublease assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in december  we recorded a restructuring credit of approximately million to recognize the net present value of future sublease rental income based upon subleases we were able to secure during for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
eitf no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
companies may enter into arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market a product 
often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
eitf no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency as a multinational company  we are subject to changes in foreign currency fluctuations 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  germany  belgium  switzerland  canada and japan 
to the extent our sales and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in exchange rates 
while foreign exchange gains and losses have historically been immaterial  we cannot predict whether such gains and losses will continue to be immaterial 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in exchange rates applied to our projected foreign operations for the fiscal year a hypothetical movement in exchange rates could materially impact our reported sales 
however  because both sales and expenses are denominated in local currency  this analysis indicated that such movement would not have a material effect on net operating results or financial condition 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but may do so in the future 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would not have materially impacted net income or materially affected the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments at either december  or as of december  we had million in debt outstanding under our credit facility 
the interest rate on the facility is based on the prime rate currently and therefore has direct and immediate response to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  and corporate bonds 
our portfolio excludes auction rate securities 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december  and  the average remaining maturities of our investment portfolio were approximately one and five months  respectively 
all of our instruments are held other than for trading purposes 
as of december  and  unrealized losses were considered to be temporary due to the fact  although available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise  securities are generally held to maturity
