table of contents critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  we have adopted various accounting policies 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  property  plant and equipment  legal proceedings  research and development  warranty obligations  product liability  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience  or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
we make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which would unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause our products to become obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would unfavorably affect future operating results 
long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including property and equipment and intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors that are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
share based compensation under the company s stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company by the board of directors 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with sfas statement r with option expense amortized over the vesting period based on the binomial lattice option pricing model fair value on the grant date  which includes a number of estimates that affect the amount of our expense 

table of contents income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  we record accruals representing our best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome

fsp apb applies to convertible debt instruments that  by their stated terms  may be settled in cash or other assets upon conversion  including partial cash settlement of the conversion option 
fsp apb requires bifurcation of the instrument into a debt component that is initially recorded at fair value and an equity component 
the difference between the fair value of the debt component and the initial proceeds from issuance of the instrument is recorded as a component of equity 
the liability component of the debt instrument is accreted to par using the effective yield method  accretion is reported as a component of interest expense 
the equity component is not subsequently re valued as long as it continues to qualify for equity treatment 
fsp apb must be applied retrospectively to previously issued cash settleable convertible instruments as well as prospectively to newly issued instruments 
fsp apb is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
because we do not have any convertible debt instruments  we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have any effect on our consolidated financial statements

eitf applies to acquired intangible assets which an entity has no intention of actively using  or intends to discontinue use of the intangible asset but holds it locks up to prevent others from obtaining access to it ie  a defensive intangible asset 
under eitf  the task force reached a consensus that an acquired defensive asset should be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting ie  an asset separate from other assets of the acquirer and the useful life assigned to an acquired defensive asset should be based on the period during which the asset would diminish in value

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our short term investments consist of cash  cash equivalents and overnight investments 
as such we do not believe we are exposed to significant interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid overnight money market investments 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date
