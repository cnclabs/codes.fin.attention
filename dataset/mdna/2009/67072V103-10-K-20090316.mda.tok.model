item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets innovative products for the treatment of kidney failure  fluid overload and related blood treatments and procedures 
our primary product  the system one  was designed to satisfy an unmet clinical need for a system that can deliver the therapeutic flexibility and clinical benefits associated with traditional dialysis machines in a smaller  portable  easy to use form that can be used by healthcare professionals and trained lay users alike in a variety of settings  including patient homes  as well as more traditional care settings such as hospitals and dialysis clinics 
given its design  the system one is particularly well suited for home hemodialysis and more frequent  or daily  dialysis  which clinical literature suggests provides patients better clinical outcomes and improved quality of life 
the system one is cleared by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for home hemodialysis as well as hospital and clinic based dialysis 
following our acquisition of medisystems corporation and certain of its affiliated entities  we also sell needles and blood tubing sets primarily to dialysis clinics for the treatment of esrd  which we refer to as the in center market 
we believe our largest future product market opportunity is for our system one used in the home hemodialysis market  or home market  for the treatment of esrd  which we previously referred to as the chronic market 
we report the results of our operations in two segments the system one segment and the in center segment 
the business we acquired in connection with our medisystems acquisition constitutes the operations of the in center segment 
this acquisition was not completed until october   and therefore  we did not realize in center segment revenues until the fourth quarter of we distribute our products in three markets the home  critical care and in center 
in the system one segment we derive our revenues from the sale and rental of equipment and the sale of disposable products in the home and critical care markets 
we define the home market as the market devoted to the treatment of esrd patients in the home and the critical care market as the market devoted to the treatment of hospital based patients with acute kidney failure or fluid overload 
in the in center segment  we derive our revenues from the sale of needles and blood tubing sets primarily used for in center dialysis treatments 
within the system one segment  we offer a similar technology platform of the system one for the home and critical care markets with different features 
the fda has cleared the system one for hemodialysis  hemofiltration and ultrafiltration 
we offer primarily needles and blood tubing sets in the in center segment 
our products are predominantly used by our customers to treat patients suffering from esrd or acute kidney failure and we have marketing and sales efforts dedicated to each market  although nearly all sales in the in center segment are made through distributors 
we received clearance from the fda in july to market the system one for treatment of renal failure and fluid overload using hemodialysis as well as hemofiltration and ultrafiltration 
in the first quarter of  we initiated sales of the system one in the critical care market to hospitals and medical centers in the 
table of contents united states 
in late  we initiated sales of the system one for the treatment of patients with esrd 
at the time of these early marketing efforts  our system one was cleared by the fda under a general indication statement  allowing physicians to prescribe the system one for hemofiltration  hemodialysis and or ultrafiltration at the location  time and frequency they considered in the best interests of their patients 
our original indication did not include a specific home clearance  and we were not able to promote the system one for home use at that time 
the fda cleared the system one in june for hemodialysis in the home 
we are presently pursuing a nocturnal indication for the system one under an fda approved investigational device exemption  or ide  study started in the first quarter of our business expanded significantly in late in connection with the acquisition of medisystems corporation and certain affiliated entities  collectively the mds entities 
with that acquisition  we acquired our needle and blood tubing set product lines for use predominantly in hemodialysis performed in center as well as apheresis 
the in center segment is significantly more mature than our system one segment 
our mds entities have been selling products to dialysis centers for the treatment of esrd since  and they have achieved leading positions in the united states market for both blood tubing sets and needles 
our blood tubing set products include the readyset high performance blood tubing set and the streamline airless blood tubing sets 
readyset has been on the market since streamline is our next generation blood tubing product designed to provide improved patient outcomes and lower costs to dialysis clinics 
this product is early in its market launch and adoption has been limited to date 
our needle product line includes av fistula needle sets incorporating safety features including pointguard anti stick needle protectors and masterguard technology and buttonhole needle sets 
our av fistula needle sets with masterguard anti stick needle protector were introduced in and our buttonhole needle sets were introduced in our customers receive reimbursement for the dialysis treatments provided with our products typically from medicare  and to a lesser degree from private insurers 
medicare provides comprehensive and well established reimbursement in the united states for esrd 
reimbursement claims for dialysis therapy using the system one or our blood tubing sets and needles are typically submitted by the dialysis clinic or hospital to medicare and other third party payors using established billing codes for dialysis treatment or  in the critical care setting  based on the patient s primary diagnosis 
medicare presently limits reimbursement for chronic hemodialysis to three treatments per week  absent a finding of medical justification 
because most of our system one home dialysis patients are treated more than three times a week  expanding medicare reimbursement over time to cover more frequent therapy may be critical to the market penetration of the system one in the home market and to our revenue growth in the future 
the manufacture of our products is accomplished through a complementary combination of outsourcing and internal production 
specifically  we manufacture our system one cycler and some pureflow sl hardware  and assemble  package and label our pureflow sl disposables within our fresnillo  mexico facility 
we manufacture components used in our system one cartridge assembly  and assemble the system one disposable cartridge and some blood tubing sets  medics and transducer protectors in tijuana  mexico 
we manufacture our dialyzers in rosdorf  germany 
we outsource the manufacture of premixed dialysate  needles  some blood tubing sets and some pureflow sl hardware 
in our system one segment  we market the system one in the home and critical care markets through a direct sales force in the united states primarily to dialysis clinics and hospitals 
in our in center segment  we market our blood tubing and needle products primarily through distributors  although we also have a small dedicated sales force for that business 
at present  we believe we have an appropriately sized sales force  although this may change as market conditions warrant 
since inception  we have incurred losses every quarter and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase as we grow our business 
while we have achieved positive gross margins for our products  in aggregate  since the fourth quarter of  we cannot provide assurance that our gross margins will improve or  if they do improve  the rate at which they will improve 
we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve profitability  when we will become profitable  the sustainability of profitability  should it occur  or the extent to which we will be profitable 
our ability to become profitable is dependent principally upon implementing design and process 
table of contents improvements to lower the costs of manufacturing our products  obtaining better purchasing terms and prices  accessing lower labor cost markets for the manufacture of our products  growing revenue  increasing reliability of our products  improving our field equipment utilization  achieving efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain overhead costs  achieving efficiencies in the distribution of our products and achieving a sufficient scale of operations 
we have experienced negative operating margins and cash flows from operations and expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future based on our projections 
on march   we amended certain terms under our current credit and security with ge 
we believe  based on current projections  that we have the required resources to fund operating requirements beyond provided that we further restructure our repayment schedule on our current credit and security agreement with ge 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the availability of credit  rate of revenue growth  continued progress on improving gross margins  the expansion of selling and marketing and research and development activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new geographies or territories  the timing of new product introductions and enhancement to existing products  the continuing market acceptance of products  and potential investments in  or acquisitions  of complementary businesses  services or technologies 
there is no assurance that additional debt or equity capital will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
statement of operations components revenues in the system one segment we derive our revenues from the sale and rental of equipment and the sale of disposable products in the home and critical care markets 
in the critical care market  we sell the system one and related disposables to hospital customers 
in the home market  customers rent or purchase the system one equipment  including cycler and pureflow sl  and then purchase the related disposable products based on a specific patient prescription 
in the in center segment  the majority of revenues are derived from supply and distribution contracts with distributors 
we generally recognize revenues when a product has been delivered to our customer or  in the home market  for those customers that rent the system one  we recognize revenues on a monthly basis in accordance with customer contracts under which we supply the use of hardware and disposables needed to perform dialysis therapy sessions during a month 
for customers that purchase the system one in the home market  we recognize revenue from the equipment sale ratably over the expected service obligation period  while disposable product revenue is recognized upon delivery 
our rental contracts with dialysis centers for esrd home dialysis patients generally include terms providing for the sale of disposable products to accommodate up to treatments per month per patient and the purchase or monthly rental of system one cyclers and  in some instances  our pureflow sl hardware 
these contracts typically have a term of one year  and are automatically renewed on a month to month basis thereafter  subject to a day termination notice 
under these contracts  if home hemodialysis is prescribed  supplies are shipped directly to patient homes and paid for by the treating dialysis clinic 
we also include vacation delivery terms  providing for the free shipment of products to a designated vacation destination 
we derive an insignificant amount of revenues from the sale of ancillary products  such as extra lengths of tubing 
over time  as more home patients are treated with the system one and more systems are placed in patient homes that provide for the purchase or rental of the machine and the purchase of the related disposables  we expect this recurring revenue stream to continue to grow 
in early  we entered into long term home market contracts for the system one with three larger dialysis chains  including davita  which was our largest customer in each of these agreements has a term of at least three years  and may be cancelled upon a material breach  subject to certain curing rights 
these contracts provide the option to purchase as well as rent the system one equipment  and  in the case of the davita contract  davita has agreed to purchase rather than rent a significant percentage of its future system one equipment needs 
in the home market  we expect  at least in the near term  that the majority of dialysis providers will choose to rent rather than purchase the system one 
as of december   we had deferred approximately million of revenues related to the sale of equipment in the home market 

table of contents our critical care contracts with hospitals generally include terms providing for the sale of our system one hardware and disposables  although we also provide a hardware rental option 
these contracts typically have a term of one year 
we expect  at least in the near term  as hospitals face increased pressure to reduce capital spending  more of our sales will include the rental rather than the sale of our system one hardware than we have experienced in the past 
as our business matures  we are starting to derive a small amount of revenue from the sale of one and two year service contracts following the expiration of our standard one year warranty period for system one hardware 
similar to our home business  as more system one equipment is placed within hospitals  we expect to derive a growing recurring revenue stream from the sale of disposable cartridges for use with our placed system one equipment as well as  to a much lesser degree  from the sale of service contracts 
our in center segment revenues are highly concentrated in several significant purchasers 
revenues from henry schein our primary distributor  represented approximately of our in center segment revenues during both and  as measured from october  revenues from our two other significant distributors over the same periods were approximately and  respectively  of our in center segment revenues 
sales to davita  through henry schein  represent a significant percentage of these revenues 
davita has contractual purchase commitments under two agreements with us  one for needles and one for blood tubing sets 
davita s purchase obligations with respect to needles expire in january its purchase obligations with respect to blood tubing sets expire in september our distribution contracts for our in center segment contain minimum volume commitments with negotiated pricing triggers at different volume tiers 
future demand for our products is expected to remain strong in the long term as chronic dialysis is a life sustaining  non elective therapy 
however  we expect demand in the short term will be susceptible to some variations as distributors look to better manage inventory levels 
each agreement may be cancelled upon a material breach  subject to certain curing rights  and in many instances minimum volume commitments can be reduced or eliminated upon certain events 
in addition to contractually determined volume discounts  we offer rebates based on sales to specific end customers and discount incentives for early payment 
our sales revenues are presented net of these rebates  incentives  discounts and returns 
our agreement with henry schein  our primary distributor for the in center segment  will expire in july and our agreements with the other primary two distributors for the in center segment are scheduled to expire in july and july  respectively 
we and henry schein have provided notice of intent to renew the agreement and we are currently in discussions with henry schein to extend or renew the agreement 
however  we have no assurance that we will be able to negotiate an extension of any of these agreements 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct product costs  including material and labor required to manufacture our products  service of system one equipment that we rent and sell to customers and production overhead 
it also includes the cost of inspecting  servicing and repairing system one equipment prior to sale or during the warranty period and stock based compensation 
the cost of our products depends on several factors  including the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  the cost at which we can obtain labor and products from third party suppliers  product reliability and related servicing costs and the design of our products 
we expect the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to decline over time for four general reasons 
first  we expect to introduce additional process and product design changes that have inherently lower cost than our current products 
second  although substantially complete  we plan to continue the transition of some service capabilities pertaining to certain products  including the system one cycler and pureflow sl  to lower labor cost markets 
third  we expect to continue to improve product reliability  which would reduce service costs 
finally  we anticipate that increased sales volume and realization of economies of scale will lead to better purchasing terms and prices and efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain overhead costs 
we cannot  however  guarantee that our expectations will be achieved with respect to our cost reduction plans 

table of contents operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for sales and marketing personnel  travel  promotional and marketing materials and other expenses associated with providing clinical training to our customers 
included in selling and marketing are the costs of clinical educators  usually nurses  we employ to teach our customers about our products and prepare our customers to instruct their patients in the operation of our products 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we broaden our marketing initiatives to increase public awareness of the system one in the home market and other products  particularly streamline  in the in center market  and as we add additional sales support and marketing personnel 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for research and development personnel  supplies  materials and expenses associated with product design and development  clinical studies  regulatory submissions  reporting and compliance and expenses incurred for outside consultants or firms who furnish services related to these activities 
we expect research and development expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to improve and enhance our core products and expand our clinical activities 
distribution 
distribution expenses include the freight cost of delivering our products to our customers or our customers patients  depending on the market and the specific agreements with our customers  salary  benefits and stock based compensation for distribution personnel and the cost of any equipment lost or damaged in the distribution process 
we use common carriers and freight companies to deliver our products and we do not operate our own delivery service 
also included in this category are the expenses of shipping products under warranty from customers back to our service center for repair and the related expense of shipping a replacement product to our customers 
we expect that distribution expenses will increase at a lower rate than revenues due to expected efficiencies gained from increased business volume  better pricing obtained from carriers following recent price negotiations  customer adoption of our pureflow sl hardware  which significantly reduces the weight and quantity of monthly disposable shipments  and improved reliability of system one equipment 
we cannot predict the estimated impact  if any  of fuel costs on future distribution costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for our executive management  legal and finance and accounting staff  fees of outside legal counsel  fees for our annual audit and tax services  and general expenses to operate the business  including insurance and other corporate related expenses 
rent  utilities and depreciation expense are allocated to operating expenses based on personnel and square foot usage 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the near term as we add additional administrative support for our business

on march   we amended our credit and security agreement with ge 
the amendment postponed principal payments under the term loan for three months  from april through june  and modified certain covenants and the interest rate on the term loan and revolving credit facility 
in connection with this amendment  we also granted our facility lenders a security interest in all of our intellectual property  increasing the collateral securing this facility to include nearly all of our assets

in the event we fail to satisfy our covenants  or otherwise go into default  ge has a number of remedies  including sale of our assets  control of our cash and cash equivalents  and acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness 
any of these remedies would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  on february   we entered into a national service provider agreement with davita  our largest customer 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we granted to davita certain market rights for the system one and related supplies for home hemodialysis therapy 
under the agreement  davita committed to purchase all of its existing system one equipment then being rented from nxstage for a purchase price of approximately million and to buy a significant percentage of its future system one equipment needs 
in connection with the national service provider agreement  on february   we issued and sold to davita million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
davita has since sold those shares 
we maintain postemployment benefit plans for employees in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the plans provide lump sum benefits  payable based on statutory regulations for voluntary or involuntary termination

significant uses of cash from operations include increases in accounts receivable and increased inventory requirements for production and placements of the system one and pureflow sl hardware  offset by increases in deferred revenue related to equipment sales in the home market 
non cash transfers from inventory to field equipment for the placement of rental units with our customers represented million  million and million  respectively  during the years ended december   and net cash provided by used in investing activities 
for each of the periods above  net cash used in investing activities reflected purchases of property and equipment  primarily for research and development  information technology  manufacturing operations and capital improvements to our facilities 
net maturities of 
table of contents short term investments were million in and million in this activity varies from period to period based upon our cash requirements and investments 
during net cash provided by investing activities included million of cash  net of acquisition costs  acquired from medisystems at the close of the transaction on october  net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities during included million of additional borrowings under our credit and security agreement with ge and million net proceeds from the sale of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock

net cash provided by financing activities during included million of net proceeds received from the follow on public offering that closed in june  million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants and net borrowings of million 
we have experienced negative operating margins and cash flows from operations and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the foreseeable future 
on march   we amended certain terms under our current credit and security agreement with ge 
we believe  based on current projections  that we have the required resources to fund operating requirements beyond provided that we further restructure our repayment schedule on our current credit and security agreement with ge 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the availability of credit  rate of revenue growth  continued progress on improving gross margins  the expansion of selling and marketing activities and research and development activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new geographies or territories  the timing of new product introductions and enhancement to existing products  the continuing market acceptance of products  and potential investments in  or acquisitions of complementary businesses  services or technologies 
there is no assurance that additional debt or equity capital will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  and the effect those commitments are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than more than total one year years years years debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations total includes repayment of maturity premium on term loan of  purchase obligations include purchase commitments for system one components  primarily for equipment  blood tubing sets  needles  and fluids pursuant to contractual agreements with several of our suppliers

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 

table of contents a summary of those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf revenues are recognized when a there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the product has been shipped or services and supplies have been provided to the customer  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collection is reasonably assured 
system one segment prior to  we derived revenue in the home market from short term rental arrangements with our customers as our principal business model 
these rental arrangements  which combine the use of the system one with a specified number of disposable products supplied to customers for a fixed amount per month  are recognized on a monthly basis in accordance with agreed upon contract terms and pursuant to binding customer purchase orders and fixed payment terms 
rental arrangements continue to represent approximately half of the arrangements we have with our customers in the home market 
equipment utilized under the rental arrangements is referred to as field equipment 
beginning in  we entered into long term customer contracts to sell system one and pureflow sl equipment along with the right to purchase disposable products and service on a monthly basis 
some of these agreements include other terms such as development efforts  training  market collaborations  limited market exclusivity and volume discounts 
the equipment and related items provided to our customers in these arrangements are considered multiple element sales arrangements pursuant to eitf when a sales arrangement involves multiple elements  the deliverables included in the arrangement are evaluated to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
we have determined that we cannot account for the sale of equipment as a separate unit of accounting 
therefore  fees received upon the completion of delivery of equipment are deferred  and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our obligation to supply disposables and service  which is five to seven years 
we have deferred both the unrecognized revenue and direct costs relating to the delivered equipment  which costs are being amortized over the same period as the related revenue 
we entered into a national service provider agreement and a stock purchase agreement with davita on february  pursuant to eitf  we consider these agreements a single arrangement 
in connection with the stock purchase agreement  davita purchased million shares of our common stock for per share  which represented a premium of per share  or million over the current market price on that date 
we have recorded the million premium as deferred revenue and will recognize this revenue ratably over seven years  consistent with our equipment service obligation to davita 
we recognized revenue of million in both and associated with the amortization of the million premium 
in the critical care market  sales are structured as direct product sales or as disposables based programs in which a customer acquires the equipment through the purchase of a specific quantity of disposables over a specific period of time 
we recognize revenues at the later of the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
under a disposables based program  the customer is granted the right to use the equipment for a period of time  during which the customer commits to purchase a minimum number of disposable cartridges or fluids at a price that includes a premium above the otherwise average selling price of the cartridges or fluids allowing us to recover the cost of the equipment and provide for a profit 
upon reaching the contractual minimum purchases  ownership of the equipment transfers to the customer 
revenues under these arrangements are recognized over the term of the arrangement as disposables are delivered 
during the reported periods  the majority of our critical care revenues were derived from supply contracts and direct product sales 

table of contents our contracts provide for training  technical support and warranty services to our customers 
we recognize training and technical support revenue when the related services are performed 
in the case of extended warranty  the revenue is recognized ratably over the warranty period 
in center segment in the in center segment  nearly all sales are structured through supply and distribution contracts with distributors 
our distribution contracts for the in center segment contain minimum volume commitments with negotiated pricing triggers at different volume tiers 
each agreement may be cancelled upon a material breach  subject to certain curing rights  and in many instances minimum volume commitments can be reduced or eliminated upon certain events 
in addition to contractually determined volume discounts  we offer rebates based on sales to specific end customers and discount incentives for early payment 
our sales revenues are presented net of these rebates  incentives  discounts and returns 
we recognize rebates to customers in the in center segment in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including reseller of the vendors products 
customer rebates are included as a reduction of sales and trade accounts receivable and are our best estimate of the amount of probable future rebates on current sales 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or estimated market 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and related cost and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on an estimated forecast of product demand for each of our existing product configurations 
we also review our inventory value to determine if it reflects lower of cost or market  with market determined based on net realizable value 
appropriate consideration is given to inventory items sold at negative gross margins  purchase commitments and other factors in evaluating net realizable value 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid development and technological advances that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate 
field equipment field equipment consists of equipment being utilized under disposable based rental agreements as well as service pool cyclers 
service pool cyclers are cyclers owned and maintained by us that are swapped for cyclers that need repairs or maintenance by us while being rented or owned by a patient 
we continually monitor the number of cyclers in the service pool  as well as cyclers that are in transit or otherwise not being used by a patient  and assess whether there are any indicators of impairment for such equipment 
we capitalize field equipment at cost and amortize field equipment through cost of revenues using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
we review the estimated useful life of five years periodically for reasonableness 
factors considered in determining the reasonableness of the useful life include industry practice and the typical amortization periods used for like equipment  the frequency and scope of service returns and the impact of planned design improvements 
we also review field equipment carrying value for reasonableness 
we consider factors such as actual equipment disposals and our ability to verify the equipment s existence in the field to identify lost equipment 
charges for lost equipment are included in distribution expenses 
accounting for stock based awards stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which generally equals the vesting period  net of forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeiture history and are updated on a quarterly basis to reflect actual forfeitures of unvested awards and other known events 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and the quoted market price of our common stock at the time of grant to estimate the fair value of our restricted stock 
table of contents units 
we have used the following assumptions in the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of equity based compensation awards expected term the expected term has been determined using the simplified method  as defined in staff accounting bulletin no 
 for estimating expected option life of plain vanilla options 
unless otherwise determined by the board or the compensation committee  stock options granted under the stock incentive plan have a contractual term of seven years  resulting in an expected term of years calculated under the simplified method 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate for each grant is equal to the us treasury rate in effect at the time of grant for instruments with an expected life similar to the expected option term 
volatility our volatility assumption is based on a combination of the stock volatility experienced by similar companies in the medical device and technology industries and the historical volatility of our publically traded stock over a period of time that approximates the expected term of the options 
valuation of business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in recent business combination under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
we have also used the income approach  as described above  to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangibles assets including developed technology  customer relationships and tradenames 
developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know how 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provides a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
tradenames represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
intangibles and other long lived assets intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets 
furthermore  periodically we assess whether our long lived assets including intangible assets  should be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas sfas requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
this impairment test is performed annually during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level 
goodwill may be considered impaired if we determine that the carrying value of our reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
when testing goodwill for impairment we primarily look to the fair value of the system one segment 
we estimate reporting unit fair value using a discounted cash flow approach which requires the use of assumptions and judgments including estimates of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values of reporting units 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for federal and state income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas under the liability method specified by sfas  a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates 
due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax asset has been established as of december  and to reflect these uncertainties 
we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  under fin  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
the company files federal  state and foreign tax returns 
the company has accumulated significant losses since its inception in since the net operating losses may potentially be utilized in future years to reduce taxable income  all of the company s tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject

recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  for financial assets and liabilities 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities that are measured or recognized at fair value on a non recurring basis on january   in accordance with the partial deferral of this standard by fasb 
we are currently evaluating the effects the provisions of sfas will have on non financial assets and liabilities that are measured or recognized at fair value on a non recurring basis 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
the adoption of sfas had no impact on previously reported results as all of the provisions were adopted prospectively 
we also adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas  effective january  sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis 
we have opted not to apply the fair value option to any financial assets or liabilities in in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
r  business combination  or sfas r  a replacement of sfas no 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applies to all business combinations 
sfas r provides that  upon initially obtaining control  an acquirer shall recognize percent of the fair values of acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions  even if the acquirer has not acquired percent of its target 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated 
additionally  sfas r changes current practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs will be expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  pre acquisition contingencies  such as legal issues  will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense  and in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  the requirements in sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  would have to be met at the acquisition date 
sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
we have not determined the effect that the adoption of sfas r will have on our consolidated financial statements  but the effect will generally be limited to future acquisitions in  except for certain tax treatment of previous acquisitions 
sfas r amends sfas such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas r would also follow the provisions of sfas r 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab sab amends and replaces question of section d 
of topic  share based payment 
sab expresses the views of the staff regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas r 
the use of the simplified method was scheduled to expire on december  sab extends the use of the simplified method for plain vanilla awards in certain situations 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for share option grants as we do not have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate due to the limited period our equity shares have been publicly traded 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term in accordance with sab 
table of contents in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas sfas enhances the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard is effective january  since sfas requires only additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging activities  adoption of sfas will not affect our financial condition or results of operation 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  or fsp fsp amends sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
 business combinations  or sfas  and other gaap 
fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset is to be applied prospectively  therefore  the impact of the implementation of this pronouncement cannot be determined until the transactions occur 
in june  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  or eitf eitf requires that we apply a two step approach in evaluating whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to our own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  that eitf will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
our investments are subject to changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our investments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we have a million loan with a fixed interest rate equal to and a million loan with an interest equal to the euribor for months plus subject to an interest rate swap agreement at rates greater than 
when euribor months plus exceeds  interest is calculated on a blended basis  with of the nominal value of the loan subject to a fixed rate of  and the remaining subject to the euribor months plus 
as of december   the carrying amount of our debt approximated fair value 
foreign currency exposure we operate a manufacturing and research facility in rosdorf  germany as well as manufacturing facilities in italy and mexico 
we purchase materials for those facilities and pay our employees at those facilities in euros and pesos 
in addition  we purchase products for resale in the united states from foreign companies and have agreed to pay them in currencies other than the us dollar  including the euro and peso 
we also have contracts with key suppliers that expose us to foreign currency risks 
as a result  our expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in periods when the us dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we incur expenses  our foreign currency based expenses increase when translated into us dollars 
although it is possible to do so and we may in the future  we do not currently hedge our foreign currency since the exposure has not been material to our historical operating results 
a movement in the euro and peso would have an overall impact to the statement of operations of approximately million for  which would have been approximately of total annual expenses
