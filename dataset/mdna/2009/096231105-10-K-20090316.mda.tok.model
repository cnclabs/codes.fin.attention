executive overview the net loss recognized in  as compared to the income recognized in  reflects the impact of the strategic initiatives implemented at bluegreen resorts  more fully described under liquidity and capital resources the recognition of impairment charges for goodwill  and inventory impairment charges recognized on certain of our communities division real estate developments 
combined  on a pre tax basis  these charges totaled million 
each of these charges is further described in the results of operations section below 
consolidated sales of real estate were million  million and million for   and  respectively 
consolidated sales of real estate increased from to and decreased from to during   and  sales of vois contributed million  million  and million of our total consolidated sales of real estate  respectively 
during   and  bluegreen communities generated million  million  and million  of our total consolidated sales of real estate  respectively 
as we discuss further under liquidity and capital resources  our resorts sales operations are materially dependent on the availability of liquidity in the credit markets 
historically  we have provided financing to our customers in of bluegreen resorts sales 
such financing typically involves the consumer making a cash down payment  with the balance being financed over a ten year period 
as bluegreen resorts selling  general and administrative expenses typically exceed the cash down payment  we have historically maintained credit facilities pursuant to which we pledged or sold our consumer note receivables 
furthermore  we also engaged in private placement term securitization transactions to periodically pay down all or a portion of our note receivable credit facilities 
in recent months  there has been unprecedented disruption in the credit markets  which has made obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and  if available  more costly 
the term securitization market has been virtually non existent  and  as a result  financial institutions are reluctant to enter into new credit facilities for the purpose of providing financing on consumer receivables 
several lenders to the timeshare industry have announced that they will either be exiting the finance business or will not be entering into new financing commitments for the foreseeable future  including certain of our lenders  such as textron financial corporation  although such lenders continue to honor existing commitments 
in addition  financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt have been generally unavailable 
while  as evidenced by bluegreen resorts results of operations during the year ended december   we believe that the market for our resorts product remains relatively strong  the uncertainties in the credit markets are requiring us  for the time being  to deemphasize our sales operations to conserve cash 
to this end  during the fourth quarter of we implemented strategic initiatives that are expected to materially reduce sales  and conserve availability under our receivables credit facilities 
such initiatives include closing certain sales offices  greatly eliminating what we have identified as lower efficiency marketing programs  emphasizing cash sales and higher cash down payments as well as our other cash based services  reducing overhead  including eliminating a significant number of staff positions across a variety of areas at various locations  limiting sales to borrowers who meet newly applied underwriting standards  and increasing interest rates on new sales transactions for which we provide financing 
our goal is to reduce the number of sales  while increasing the ultimate profitability of those sales we do make 
for more detailed information on our strategic initiatives  see liquidity and capital resources below 
we believe that we have adequate timeshare inventory to satisfy our projected sales and  based on anticipated reduced sales levels  a number of years thereafter 
we intend to continue to provide high quality vacation experiences to our bluegreen vacation club owners and believe that these initiatives should not have any material impact on owner satisfaction with our products and services 
as a result of implementing these actions  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of we believe that these actions were appropriate in the current challenging environment  yet will position us to once again grow once the credit markets allow 
we continue to actively pursue additional credit facility capacity  capital markets transactions  and alternative financing solutions and we hope that the steps we are taking will position us to maintain existing  strong credit relationships  as well as attract new sources of capital 
regardless of the state of the credit markets  however  we believe that our resorts management and finance operations will continue to represent recurring cash generating sources of income which do not require material liquidity support from the credit markets 
we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our gross revenues and results of operations 
this seasonality may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  with the majority of our gross revenues and net earnings historically expected to occur in the quarters ending in september and december of each year 
although we expect to see more potential customers at our sales offices during the quarters ending in june and september  ultimate recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be delayed due to complex down payment requirements for real estate sales under gaap or due to the timing of development and the requirement that we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we believe that inflation and changing prices have materially impacted our revenues and results of operations  specifically due to periodic increases in the sales prices of our vois and homesites and increases in construction and development costs from time to time during the last three to five years 
the increased construction and development costs over the past few years are expected to result in an increase in our cost of sales for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance that we will be able to increase or maintain the current level of our sales prices or that increased construction costs will not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin 
in addition  to the extent that inflation in general or increased prices for our vois and homesites would adversely impact consumer demand  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
also  to the extent inflationary trends  tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates  our debt service costs may increase 
our bluegreen communities business has been adversely impacted by deterioration in the real estate markets generally 
although to date we have not experienced a significant reduction in sale prices  we have experienced a material decrease in demand  particularly for higher priced premium homesites  and an overall decrease in sales volume 
we have historically financed a majority of bluegreen resorts sales of vois  and accordingly  are subject to the risk of defaults by customers 
gaap requires that we reduce sales of vois by our estimate of future uncollectible note balances on originated voi receivables  excluding any benefit for the value of future recoveries 
during the year ended december   we reduced sales of vois by million for such provision 
the table below sets forth the activity in our allowance for uncollectible notes receivable for the year ended december  in thousands balance  december  provision for loan losses less allowance on sold receivables less write offs of uncollectible receivables balance  december  includes provision for loan losses on homesite notes receivable the average annual default rates and delinquency rates more than days past due on bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities receivables owned or serviced by us were as follows average annual default rates year ended december  division bluegreen resorts bluegreen communities delinquency rates as of december  division bluegreen resorts bluegreen communities the percentage of our serviced voi notes receivable portfolio that was over days past due as of the dates indicated 
we believe that unemployment in the united states and economic conditions in general will continue to adversely impact the performance of our notes receivable portfolio 
we also believe  however  that our newly implemented credit underwriting standards on new loan originations and increasing customer equity in the existing loan portfolio will have a favorable performance impact on the portfolio over time 
substantially all defaulted vacation ownership notes receivable result in the holder of the note receivable acquiring the related voi that secured the note receivable  typically soon after default and at little or no cost 
in cases where bluegreen has retained ownership of the vacation ownership note receivable  the voi is reacquired and resold in the normal course of business  partially mitigating the loss from the default typically  these recoveries range from approximately to of the defaulted principle balance depending on the age of the receivable at default 
we may  but are not obligated to  remarket the defaulted voi on behalf of the note holder in exchange for a remarketing fee designed to approximate our sales and marketing costs 
a significant portion of our revenues historically has been comprised of gains on sales of notes receivable 
the gains were recorded on our consolidated statement of operations as a component of sales of real estate and the related retained interests in the notes receivable sold have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale 
the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently reviewing the accounting principles relative to the transfer of financial assets  including the sale of notes receivable 
in advance of possible new accounting rules  which could be effective as early as  bluegreen made a decision to structure any future sales of notes receivable so they are treated as on balance sheet borrowings 
this impacts the comparability to prior periods as transactions structured in this way do not result in gains on sale of notes receivable 
during  the deteriorating credit markets negatively impacted our financing activities 
although we were able to secure financing and securitize voi notes receivable in  fewer transactions were consummated and those that were consummated were more difficult to effect and were priced at a higher cost than in prior periods 
in addition  recent economic events have further constricted the financial markets to unprecedented low levels 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to secure funding or to convert voi notes receivable on acceptable terms  if at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to the recognition of revenue  including revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of accounting  our reserve for loan losses  the valuation of retained interests in notes receivable sold and the related gains on sales of notes receivable  the recovery of the carrying value of real estate inventories  golf courses  intangible assets and other assets  and the estimate of contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely impacted 
revenue recognition and inventory cost allocation 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  as amended by sfas no 
regarding voi sales  we recognize revenue on voi and homesite sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash buyer s commitment  the legal rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold 
we believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectibility of the receivables representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold 
see the further discussion of our policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on our notes receivable below 
should we become unable to reasonably estimate the collectibility of our receivables  we may have to defer the recognition of sales and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
under sfas no 
 the buyer s minimum cash down payment towards the purchase of our vois is met only if the cash down payment received  reduced by the value of certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of sale  is at least of the sales price 
if  after consideration of the value of the incentive  the total down payment received from the buyer is less than of the sales price  the voi sale  and the related cost of sales and direct selling expenses  are deferred until such time that sufficient cash is received from the customer  generally through receipt of mortgage payments 
changes to the quantity  type  or value of sales incentives that we provide to buyers of our vois may result in additional voi sales being deferred  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
in cases where all development has not been completed  we recognize revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
should our estimates of the total anticipated cost of completing bluegreen resorts or bluegreen communities projects increase  we may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to defer revenue for a longer period of time  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
voi inventory and cost of sales is accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 which defines a specific method of the relative sales value method for relieving voi inventory and recording cost of sales 
under the sfas no 
relative sales value method  cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage the ratio of total estimated development cost to total estimated voi revenue  including the estimated incremental revenue from the resale of voi inventory repossessed  generally as a result of the default of the related receivable 
for communities real estate projects  costs are allocated to individual homesites in the communities projects based on the relative estimated sales value of each homesite in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
under this method  the allocated cost of a unit is relieved from inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon recognition of the related sale 
should our estimates of the sales values of our voi and homesite inventories differ materially from their ultimate selling prices  our gross profit could be adversely impacted 
allowance for loan losses on voi notes receivable 
we estimate uncollectible voi notes receivable based on historical uncollectibles for similar voi notes receivable over the applicable historical period 
we use a static pool analysis  which tracks uncollectibles for each year s sales over the entire life of those notes 
we also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions 
additionally  under timeshare accounting requirements  no consideration is given for future recoveries of defaulted inventory in the estimate of uncollectible voi notes receivable 
we review our reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
if defaults increase  our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
transfers of financial assets and valuation of retained interests 
when we transfer financial assets to third parties  such as when we sell voi notes receivable pursuant to our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities  we evaluate whether or not such transfer should be accounted for as a sale pursuant to sfas no 
and related interpretations 
the evaluation of sale treatment under sfas no 
involves legal assessments of the transactions  which include determining whether the transferred assets have been isolated from us ie  put presumptively beyond our reach or the reach of our creditors  even in bankruptcy or other receivership  determining whether each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received  and ensuring that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either an agreement that both entitles and obligates us to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets other than through a cleanup call 
we believe that we have obtained appropriate legal opinions and other guidance deemed necessary to properly account for our transfers of financial assets as sales in accordance with sfas no 
as previously indicated  should we be successful in selling additional notes receivable in the future  we have made the decision to structure such transactions so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings 
accordingly  we do not expect to recognize any future gains on the sale of notes receivable 
while we believe the on balance sheet treatment for the sale of notes receivable provides more transparent results  our results of operations and cash flows from operations will be negatively impacted compared to those periods in which off balance sheet accounting was used 
in connection with the sales of notes receivable referred to above  we retain subordinated tranches and rights to excess interest spread  which are retained interests in the notes receivable sold 
gain or loss on the sale of the notes receivable has depended in part on the allocation of the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
we initially and periodically estimate the fair value of our retained interest in notes receivable sold based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions prepayment rates  loss severity rates  default rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
should our estimates of these key assumptions change or should the portfolios sold fail to satisfy specified performance criteria and therefore trigger provisions whereby outside investors in the portfolios are paid on an accelerated basis  there could be a reduction in the fair value of the retained interests and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
during the year ended december   we recognized other than temporary decreases totaling approximately million in the fair market value of certain of our retained interest in notes receivable sold 
the overall decrease in the fair value of our retained interest in voi notes receivable in was a result of higher discount rates and unfavorable changes to our estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows from our retained interests 
the higher discount rate during reflects an increase in our estimate of the required yield by a potential investor in our residual interests as of december  asset impairment 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets  including our real estate properties and goodwill  as required by applicable accounting pronouncements 
with respect to our real estate properties  such evaluation is conducted under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 if an indicator of impairment exists for a project  or a phase of a project  an impairment evaluation must be performed to determine if the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable 
due to the current state of the economy and the real estate market  we assess the recovery of the carrying amounts of our communities division property on a quarterly basis 
based on a project s status as substantially complete or under development  our assessment consists of determining recoverability of our costs based upon a combination of factors including estimates of remaining life of project sales for each project  the period required to complete such sales  estimates of costs to complete each project  if needed  and various other factors including relevant market data 
during  as a result of our evaluation of communities division property  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million 
should our estimates of these factors change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
during the year ended december   we completed the required annual impairment testing of our goodwill recorded in our bluegreen resorts reporting unit 
as a result of our evaluation  we determined that the fair value of our reporting units  based on our overall market capitalization  could not support the recorded book value of goodwill 
accordingly  we wrote off the entire balance of our goodwill and recorded a charge of million 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
in february  the fasb agreed to partially defer for one year the effective date of sfas no 
 with respect to non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas no 
r  subject to limited exceptions  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
additionally  due diligence and transaction costs incurred to effect an acquisition will be expensed as incurred  as opposed to being capitalized as part of the acquisition purchase price which is currently our practice 
sfas no 
r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
r must be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a non controlling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas no 
clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas no 
also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
sfas no 
will become effective for us beginning with our fiscal year 
upon the initial adoption of this statement  we will change the classification and presentation of the non controlling interest in the bluegreen big cedar joint venture  which we currently refer to as minority interest 
results of operations we review financial information  allocate resources and manage our business as two segments  bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities 
the information reviewed is based on internal reports and excludes an allocation of general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead 
the information provided is based on a management approach and is used by us for the purpose of tracking trends and changes in results 
it does not reflect the actual economic costs  contributions or results of operations of the segments as stand alone businesses 
if a different basis of presentation or allocation were utilized  the relative contributions of the segments might differ but the relative trends  in our view  would likely not be materially impacted

bluegreen resorts year ended december  compared to the year ended december  bluegreen resorts resort sales and marketing the following table sets forth certain information for sales of vois for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting and the deferral of sales in accordance with sfas no 
for the year ended december  number of voi sales transactions average sales price per transaction number of total prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio total prospects number of new prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio new prospects bluegreen resorts gross voi sales prior to the impact of estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable and gain on sale of notes receivable increased million  or  during as compared to primarily due to our continued focus on marketing to our bluegreen vacation club owner base 
sales to owners increased by and accounted for of resorts sales during as compared to during additionally  although the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts decreased by  the overall sale to tour conversion ratio increased during  resulting in an overall sales increase during as compared to in connection with the restructuring described below  we closed a number of sales locations and implemented various changes to our sales program that we expect will materially reduce the number of sales transactions  and the amount of sales during as required under sfas no 
 approximately million and million of gain on sales of voi notes receivable in and  respectively  were reflected as an increase to voi sales 
the majority of these gains represent the reversal of amounts previously recognized as estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable 
while the overall decrease in gain on sale of voi notes receivable in as compared to was primarily the result of lower off balance sheet receivable sales during compared to million of loans in compared to million in  as a percentage of notes receivable sold  the gain decreased in due to higher interest rates required by investors in the securitization market 
as we previously announced any future sales of our notes receivable will be structured so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings 
accordingly  we do not expect to recognize future gains on the sale of notes receivable 
while we believe the on balance sheet treatment for the sale of notes receivable provides more transparent results  our results of operations and operating cash flows will be negatively impacted compared to those periods in which off balance sheet accounting was used 
the increase in gross voi revenue was further reduced by an increase of million  or  in our estimate of future uncollectible voi notes receivable primarily due to higher gross voi sales in as compared to  and a higher default experience 
bluegreen resorts gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period 
gross margin during as compared to was positively impacted by sales of vois located at our bluegreen wilderness traveler at shenandoah resort  which has a relatively low cost  and to a lesser extent  by a system wide price increase during the first quarter of selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during the increase in selling and marketing expenses during as compared to reflected the overall increase in sales and a general increase in overall marketing expenses 
as a percentage of sales  our selling and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of the recognition of smaller gains on sale recorded as a component of revenue in as compared to  partially offset by increased sales to existing owners  which generally carry lower marketing costs  and a slightly higher sale to tour conversion rate 
as a percentage of gross voi sales prior to estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable and gain on sale of notes receivable  selling and marketing expenses increased to in from in we believe that selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of gross voi sales is an important indicator of the performance of bluegreen resorts and our performance as a whole 
no assurance can be given that selling and marketing expenses will not increase as a percentage of gross voi sales in future periods 
as a result of our strategic initiatives  we believe that total selling and marketing expense for bluegreen resorts will be materially reduced in as compared to see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information on these reductions 
field general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts decreased million  or  during as compared to as a percentage of sales  field general and administrative expenses decreased from during to in as a result of closing certain of our sales offices in connection with the strategic initiatives  we anticipate that our future field general and administrative expenses will continue to decrease overall 
as of december   approximately million and million of sales and field operating profit  respectively  were deferred under sfas no 
because such sales did not yet meet the minimum required buyer s initial investment 
this compares to million and million of sales and field operating profits  respectively  deferred as of december  we intend to pursue providing sales and marketing services to third party resort developers and others  on a cash fee basis 
this would involve utilizing our sales and marketing infrastructure  processes and associates  as well as benefits of the bluegreen vacation club  to assist parties that own resorts with the sale of vois in their property  in exchange for a cash fee for such services 
we believe that this will become an increasing portion of our business over time resort management and other services the following table sets forth pre tax profit generated from our resort management and other services in thousands for the year ended december  resort management operations title operations net carrying cost of developer inventory other total resort management operations gross profit increased million  or  during as compared to  primarily the result of higher fees earned by providing services to bluegreen vacation club members and from managing timeshare resorts on behalf of property owners associations 
as of december   we had approximately  voi owners  including  members in the bluegreen vacation club compared to  voi owners  including approximately  members in the bluegreen vacation club  as of december   respectively 
additionally  as of december  we directly or indirectly managed timeshare properties compared to as of december  gross profit generated from our title operations fluctuates based upon the number of voi sales transactions processed by our subsidiary title company and on the mix of voi inventory sold third party closing costs vary by location of underlying real estate sold 
during  we expect that our title operations and related profit will decrease commensurate with the reduction in voi sales 
the carrying costs of our developer owned inventory consist of maintenance fees and developer subsidies paid on vois in inventory relative to the property owners associations that maintain our resorts 
we mitigate this expense  to the extent possible  through the rental of our owned voi units 
accordingly  the net carrying cost of developer inventory fluctuates with the number of voi units we hold and the number of resorts subject to a developer subsidy arrangement during a period  as well as by rental activity realized 
during and  the carrying cost of our developer inventory totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and was off set by rental proceeds of million and million during those periods 
we intend to pursue providing resorts management and title services to third party resort developers and others  on a cash fee basis 
we believe that this will become an increasing portion of our business over time 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we implemented strategic initiatives in the resort division that are more fully described under liquidity and capital resources 
restructuring charges incurred as a result of implementing our strategic initiatives  as well as our remaining liability were as follows charges during cash payments made during liability at december  severance and benefit related costs lease termination obligation fixed assets write downs  net of proceeds other total restructuring includes severance payments made to employees  payroll taxes and other benefit related costs in connection with the terminations of over  employees  as applicable 
includes costs associated with noncancelable property and equipment leases that the we have ceased to use  as well as termination fees related to the cancellation of certain contractual lease obligations 
included in this amount are future minimum lease payments in excess of estimated sublease income  fees and expenses for which the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities were satisfied 
includes write downs of million and million for leasehold improvements and property and equipment  respectively  net of a nominal amount of cash received in connections with selling assets 
approximately million of this balance was paid as of february  with remaining payments to extend through november lease payments will be paid monthly through november bluegreen resorts year ended december  compared to the year ended december  bluegreen resorts resort sales and marketing bluegreen resorts net sales of real estate increased million  or  during as compared to as a result of higher sales of vois and higher gains on sales of voi notes receivable  partially offset by an increase in estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable 
the following table sets forth certain information for sales of vois for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting and the deferral of sales in accordance with sfas no 
for the year ended december  number of voi sales transactions average sales price per transaction number of total prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio total prospects number of new prospects tours sale to tour conversion ratio new prospects gross voi sales increased million  or  driven primarily by our continued focus on marketing to our growing bluegreen vacation club owner base 
sales to owners increased by and accounted for of resorts sales during as compared to during also contributing to higher sales was same resort sales increases at many of our sales offices 
same resort sales increased by almost during as compared to and were highlighted by increases in sales originating at the smoky mountain preview center in sevierville  tennessee  the falls village resort in branson  missouri  mountainloft in gatlinburg  tennessee  and an offsite sales office in las vegas  nevada 
higher sales were also attributable  to a lesser extent  to the opening of new sales offices at seaglass tower  located in myrtle beach  sc  and at a new resort under development in williamsburg  virginia  as well as an system wide price increase that went into effect during march these factors  combined with a overall increase in the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts during  and a relatively consistent  overall sale to tour conversion ratio during these periods  contributed to the overall sales increase during as compared to the increase in the average sales price per transaction  primarily due to the system wide price increase  also contributed to higher voi sales 
as required under sfas no 
 approximately million and million of gain on sales of voi notes receivable in and  respectively  are reflected as an increase to voi sales 
the majority of these gains represent the reversal of amounts previously recognized as estimated uncollectible voi notes receivable 
the increase in gain on sale of voi notes receivable in as compared to represents the sale of million of loans in compared to million in the increase in voi revenue and gains on sales of voi notes receivable were partially offset by an increase of million  or  in our estimate of future uncollectible voi notes receivable primarily due to higher voi sales in as compared to bluegreen resorts gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period 
as compared to the gross margin earned in  our gross margin of for was negatively impacted by a higher proportion of sales of vois in of relatively higher cost resorts as compared to overall gross margins on vois sold in decreased compared to previous periods reflecting the higher costs of acquiring and developing properties

because such sales did not yet meet the minimum required initial investment 
this compares to million and million of sales and field operating profits  respectively  deferred as of december  resort management and other services overall  resort management and other services pre tax profit increased approximately during as compared to this increase was primarily the result of higher resort management operations gross profit and lower carrying costs of our developer owned inventory in as compared to pre tax profit earned from our resort management operations increased as a result of higher fees for managing timeshare resorts on behalf of property owners associations 
as of december  there were  voi owners  including  members in the bluegreen vacation club compared to  voi owners  including approximately  members in the bluegreen vacation club  as of december   respectively 
additionally  as of december  we managed timeshare properties compared to as of december  during and the carrying cost of our developer inventory totaled approximately million and million  respectively and was off set by rental proceeds of million and million during those periods 
the pre tax profit earned from our title operations was consistent with the amount earned in bluegreen communities the table below sets forth the number of homesites sold by bluegreen communities and the average sales price per homesite for the periods indicated  before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting  sales in certain properties that had not completed the platting process  and excluding sales of bulk parcels 
year ended december  december  december  number of homesites sold average sales price per homesite communities sales decreased million  or  during as compared to sales at bluegreen communities have been adversely impacted by the deterioration of the economy generally and the real estate markets  in particular 
although to date we have not experienced a significant deterioration of our sales prices  we have experienced a decline in sales volume  especially in our higher priced premium homesites 
while we have experienced a decline in our average sales price per homesite in from  it reflects a diversity of communities available with varied price points and the impact of a higher percentage of premium lots sold in at properties substantially sold out in before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting  during we entered into contracts to sell homesites totaling million  as compared to million during sales in consisted of real estate sold at the following properties in thousands properties sold in projects not substantially sold out at december  project difference chapel ridge lake ridge at joe pool lake havenwood at hunter s crossing vintage oaks at the vineyard the bridges at preston crossings sugar tree on the brazos sanctuary cove at st

additionally  sales in benefited from approximately million of sales made in  that were not recognized as revenue until see discussion below 
bluegreen communities sales decreased million  or  during as compared to largely reflecting several of the company s more mature developments either approaching sell out or sold out during or prior to  partially offset by the recognition of sales generated at the estates of sanctuary cove which commenced sales in and the recognition of million of sales made in at properties which had not completed the platting process until before giving effect to the percentage of completion method of accounting  during we entered into contracts to sell homesites totaling million  as compared to million during sales in consisted of real estate sold at the following properties in thousands properties sold in projects not substantially sold out at december  project difference chapel ridge sanctuary cove at st

additionally  because the platting process for certain properties sold near the end of was not completed before the end of we were unable to recognize approximately million of sales in  which were subsequently recognized in as a result of our decreased volume and its impact of extending the forecasted sell out period of our projects  we recorded a charge to cost of real estate sales of approximately million in to write down the inventory balances of certain phases of our communities properties that were completed in to their estimated fair value 
we calculated the estimated fair value of these impaired properties based on our analysis of their estimated future cash flows  given what we believe to be reasonable assumptions 
should the real estate market decline further  or if other factors change our assumptions about the future  it may be necessary to record additional impairment charges with respect to these or other projects in the future 
excluding the impairment charge  bluegreen communities gross margin  decreased from in to in bluegreen communities gross margin increased from in to in variations in cost structures and the market pricing of projects available for sale as well as the opening of phases of projects  which include premium homesites eg  water frontage  preferred views  larger acreage homesites  etc 
impact the gross margin of bluegreen communities from period to period 
these factors  as well as the impact of percentage of completion accounting  will cause variations in gross margin between periods  although the gross margin of bluegreen communities has historically been between and of sales 
in addition  during  our gross margin was negatively impacted by the bulk sale of property near san diego  california  which had a relatively low margin  as well as the recognition of a charge of approximately million to repair a lake amenity at a nearly sold out community 
other communities operations generally include the operation of our daily fee golf courses  as well as realty resale operations at several of our residential land communities 
during  other communities operations also includes revenue and costs associated with the sale of our right to purchase a property in north carolina  which resulted in a profit of approximately million 
additionally  during  other communities operations revenue and costs includes the sale of our traditions of braselton golf course  which resulted in a profit of approximately  excluding the impact of the above one time transaction  revenue and costs from our other communities operations decreased in as compared to  and also decreased in compared to the decrease in compared to was primarily a result of lower golf course green fees and lower golf course operating costs 
golf course operations decreased during as a result of operating fewer golf courses in  due to the sale of the traditions of braselton golf course 
the decrease in was primarily a result of lower realty resale operations activity during compared to certain of our golf course operations periodically incur losses during periods of low level of play  especially during the winter months  and as a result of fixed operating expenses and high maintenance costs 
also  certain of our golf courses are still in their early years of operations during the periods presented 
we believe that the operating results of these new courses should improve as individuals who have purchased homesites in the communities in which these courses are located build their homes and begin living in the community  as this should increase the amount of play on our golf courses 
however  there is no assurance that such improvement in operating results will be achieved 
total selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities decreased million  or in as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during the increase in selling and marketing costs as a percentage of sales in reflects a lower rate of conversion of prospects to sales in and the continued shift toward more regionally focused internet based marketing  which generally have higher up front costs 
higher advertising expenses were partially off set by lower commission expenses commensurate with the decline in sales 
total selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities remained relatively constant in and however  as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during the increase in selling and marketing costs as a percentage of sales in reflects higher advertising expenses  primarily as a result of the shift to internet based marketing  as costs are incurred prior to the periods when prospects generated are expected to tour our communities 
higher advertising expenses were partially off set by lower commission commensurate with lower sales 
bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses decreased million or in as compared to as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in  reflecting the overall decrease in sales

we have organized a real estate advisory services business and will be pursuing opportunities to use our core competencies to provide asset management  market research and other real estate consulting services to third parties on a fee basis 
finance operations our finance operations include the ongoing excess interest spread earned on over million of on balance sheet notes receivable  as well as continued earnings on over million of off balance sheet notes receivable  realized through our retained interests in those notes 
in addition  finance operations include providing mortgage servicing on the off balance sheet notes receivable which are on a cash fee for service basis 
interest income 
the following table details the sources of our interest income in thousands year ended december  voi notes receivable retained interest in notes receivable sold other total the increase in interest income during  as compared to  reflects a higher average balance of our vacation ownership notes receivable and higher interest accretion recognized on our retained interest in notes receivable sold 
notes receivable increased during due to a higher amount of financed sales  coupled with our use of on balance sheet transactions to monetize our notes receivable 
higher interest income was partially offset by the recognition of million in other than temporary decreases in our retained interest in notes receivable sold as compared to decreases of million in 
the overall decrease in the fair value of our retained interest in voi notes receivable in was a result of higher discount rates and unfavorable changes to our estimate of the amount and timing of future cash flows on our retained interests 
the higher discount rate during reflects an increase in our estimate of the required yield by a potential investor in our residual interests as of december  there can be no assurance that additional charges will not be required due to other than temporary decreases in the fair value of our retained interest in notes receivables sold 
as previously stated  we plan to monetize future vacation ownership notes receivable through the use of on balance sheet transactions 
accordingly  we expect that in future periods the proportion of interest income earned from voi notes receivable will increase  while interest income generated by our retained interest in notes receivable sold will decrease 
the increase in interest income during as compared to was due primarily to higher interest accretion on our retained interest in notes receivable sold as a result of higher average retained interests in due to the sale of additional voi notes receivable and higher average vacation ownership notes receivable balances during as compared to this increase was partially off set by the recognition of other than temporary decreases totaling approximately million in in the fair value of certain of our retained interests in voi notes receivable 
the overall decrease in the value of our retained interest in voi notes receivable in reflects an increase in the discount rates applied to estimated future cash flows on our retained interests as a result of the overall increase in return required by investors in our securitization transactions due to the deteriorating credit market in the second half of interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense during as compared to was primarily the result of lower average interest rates on debt outstanding 
our average interest rate declined in due to the repayment of our million of senior secured notes payable in march and the decrease in variable rates 
in addition  interest expense during also reflects the reduction of accrued interest related to internal revenue code irc section irc section requires that certain companies accrue and pay interest on income deferred under the installment method of profit recognition 
during  we made certain operational changes in an effort to optimize the utilization of certain of our state net operating losses 
the implementation of these changes had the impact of reducing our deferred interest obligation under irc section by approximately million 
the increase in interest expense during compared to was primarily a result of higher average debt outstanding partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized in connection with current development activity as compared to average debt outstanding during increased in part as a result of the february issuance of million of junior subordinated debentures and increased borrowings on operating lines of credit during the second half of in order to increase our cash on hand 
total interest expense capitalized to construction in progress was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
our decision to structure future sales of our notes receivable so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings will result in the recognition of higher amounts of debt  compared to prior transactions which are treated as off balance sheet financings 
based on the timing and repayment of these transactions  our debt and related interest expense may materially increase 
our effective cost of borrowing was  and for   and  respectively 
mortgage servicing operations our mortgage servicing operations record  process payments  and perform collections on our owned notes receivable  as well as on notes receivable sold to third parties 
in addition our mortgage servicing operations facilitate the monetization of our voi notes receivable through our various credit facilities  as well as perform monthly reporting activities for our lenders and receivable investors 
further  we earn a fee for servicing those loans that have been sold to off balance sheet qualified special purpose entities 
we intend to pursue providing these services to other third party portfolio owners  on a cash fee basis 
the following is a summary of the results of our mortgage servicing operations in thousands years ended december  servicing fee income cost of mortgage servicing operations gross profit from mortgage servicing operations corporate general and administrative expenses our corporate general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with administering the various support functions at our corporate headquarters  including accounting  human resources  information technology  treasury  and legal 
corporate general and administrative expenses  excluding mortgage servicing operations  were million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the million  or  increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to higher health insurance cost and higher stock compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by lower litigation costs  and the receipt of million from diamond resorts as a recovery of the due diligence cost incurred by us in connection with its terminated acquisition proposal 
the million  or  increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to higher administration costs to support growth and higher litigation costs 
for a discussion of field selling  general and administrative expenses  see sales and field operations  above 
other expense  net 
other expense  net was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in other expense  net during compared to consists primarily of a charge of approximately million for a loss on disposal of various fixed assets as a result of closing certain of our off site sales offices  prior to the fourth quarter restructuring 
minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary 
we include the results of operations and financial position of bluegreen big cedar vacations  llc the subsidiary  our owned subsidiary  in our consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary is the portion of our consolidated pre tax income that is attributable to big cedar  llc  the unaffiliated interest holder in the subsidiary 
minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately  and over for  and our annual effective tax rate has historically ranged between and  based upon the mix of taxable earnings among the various states in which we operate 
during  our effective rate was negatively impacted  as a portion of our goodwill write off was not deductible for tax purposes 
future changes to our operations  including shifts in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business  or changes in the currently enacted tax rates  can materially change our effective tax rate 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our future effective income tax rate will be comparable to our historical rates 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle from the adoption of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january  resulted in a net charge of million  which is presented as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle primarily consists of the deferral of voi sales and related costs for sales that were previously recognized but did not meet the required down payment threshold at january   due to sales incentives provided to buyers and the treatment of our sampler program  and the related tax benefit  net of the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle charge  related to the minority interest in the subsidiary 
summary 
based on the factors discussed above  our net income was million and million for and  respectively  and our net loss for was million 
changes in financial condition the following table summarizes our cash flows for  and in thousands year ended december  december  december  cash flows provided used by operating activities cash flows provided by investing activities cash flows used provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million from net cash outflows of million to outflow of million during and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities during compared to was primarily a result of our decision to structure sales of our notes receivable after march so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings 
as we provide up to financing to customers representing approximately of our resort sales  operating cash flows are expected to be negative in periods of increasing sales 
we typically monetize our receivables through various on balance sheet purchase facilities and hypothecation facilities  the cash flows from which are included in cash provided by financing activities 
only when we structure receivable finance transactions as off balance sheet sales do the associated cash proceeds increase cash from operating activities 
during  we sold million of notes receivable through off balance sheet transactions compared to million in while we did monetize million of notes receivable through on balance sheet transactions during  all of the associated cash inflow is included in cash from financing activities 
the decision to structure sales of our notes receivable so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings has not and will not  in and of itself  impact total cash flows  however  we expect that it has had and will have the effect of reducing cash inflows from operating activities and increasing cash inflows from financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million from net cash inflows of million to an outflow of million during and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities during compared to was primarily driven by higher resort development spending at our williamsburg  las vegas  and odyssey dells projects and an increase in notes receivable due to increased voi sales 
this decrease was partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of notes receivable during  as compared to cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities decreased million from net cash inflows of million to million for and  respectively 
this decrease was due primarily to higher expenditures in for property and equipment as compared to and by the expenditure of cash to acquire the real estate and operations at two resorts  the royal suites at atlantic palace in atlantic city  new jersey  and club la pension in new orleans  louisiana  each of which constituted the purchase of a business 
these outflows were offset by higher amounts of cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold as compared to amounts received in the period 
cash flows from investing activities increased million from net cash inflows of million to million for and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to higher amounts of cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold and lower expenditures in for property and equipment as compared to cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities increased million from net cash inflows of million to inflows of million during and  respectively 
this increase was primarily related to an increase of approximately million in net borrowings that are collateralized by voi notes receivable 
this increase was partially offset by lower borrowings of approximately million in under our lines of credit compared to million in cash flows from financing activities were also reduced in by the repayment of our million senior secured notes on march  in addition  during the period  we received million of proceeds in connection with our issuance of the junior subordinated debentures and had no such proceeds during the period 
cash flows from financing activities increased million from net cash outflows of million to inflows of million during and  respectively 
we borrowed million in under our lines of credit compared to million in  and incurred higher net borrowings under our collateralized notes receivable facilities in as compared to these cash flows were partially offset by the receipt of million of proceeds in connection with our issuance of the junior subordinated debentures in  as compared to the receipt of only million of such proceeds during liquidity and capital resources our primary capital resources from internal operations are i cash sales  ii down payments on homesite and voi sales which are financed  iii proceeds from the sale of  or borrowings collateralized by  notes receivable  including cash received from our retained interests in notes receivable sold  iv cash from our finance operations  including principal and interest payments received on the purchase money mortgage loans arising from sales of vois and homesites and mortgage servicing fees  and v net cash generated from other resort services  including our resorts management operations  and other communities operations 
historically our business model has depended on the availability of credit in the commercial markets 
resorts sales are dependent upon us providing financing to our buyers 
our ability to sell and or borrow against our notes receivable from voi buyers is a critical factor in our continued liquidity 
when we sell vois  a financed buyer is only required to pay a minimum of of the purchase in cash at the time of sale  however  selling  marketing  and administrative expenses attributable to the sale are primarily cash expenses and exceed the buyer s down payment 
accordingly  having financing facilities available for the hypothecation  sale  or transfer of these vacation ownership receivables is a critical factor in our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
historically  we have relied on our ability to sell receivables in the term securitization market in order to generate liquidity and create capacity in our receivable facilities 
in addition  maintaining adequate voi inventory to sell and pursue growth into new markets has historically resulted in the incurrence of debt for the acquisition  construction and development of new resorts 
bluegreen communities has also historically incurred debt for the acquisition and development of our residential land communities 
in recent months  there have been unprecedented disruptions in the credit markets  which have made obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and more costly 
the term securitization market has been virtually non existent  and  as a result  financial institutions are reluctant to enter into new credit facilities for the purpose of providing financing on consumer receivables 
several lenders to the timeshare industry have announced that they will either be exiting the finance business or will not be entering into new financing commitments for the foreseeable future  including certain of our lenders  such as textron financial corporation  although such lenders continue to honor existing commitments 
in addition  financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt have been generally unavailable 
while there is no assurance we will be successful we are currently exploring alternatives to the traditional credit and securitization markets for monetizing our voi receivables 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a decision to implement certain strategic initiatives with a view to better positioning our operations in the event of a prolonged downturn in the commercial credit markets 
we anticipate that as a result of these and other initiatives that our sales of vois will be materially less than our sales 
we intend to continue to monitor our results as well as the external environment in order to attempt to adjust our business to the conditions which exist to the extent possible 
the ongoing goals of our strategic initiatives are designed to conserve cash and enhance our financial position by significantly reducing our resorts sales operations in an effort to match our sales pace to our liquidity and known receivable capacity  to the extent possible  emphasizing cash based business in our sales  resort management and finance operations  minimizing from the cash requirements of bluegreen communities to the extent possible  reducing overhead and increasing efficiency  minimizing capital spending  working with our lenders to renew  extend  or refinance our credit facilities 
maintaining compliance under our outstanding indebtedness 
continuing to provide what we believe to be a high level of quality vacation experiences and customer service to our voi owners 
while there is no assurance that these goals will be achieved  initial actions taken to date include the following we closed of our sales offices  including all of our off site sales offices 
closures were concentrated on sales offices that were generating marginal profits and  in some cases  losses 
because we can typically sell our voi inventory in any of our sales offices our entire voi inventory is saleable despite the closure of the sales office at any particular resort 
we implemented a credit underwriting program for our financed sales 
fico score criteria are being used as a condition of financing as well as  in determining the appropriate level of down payment 
we eliminated certain marketing programs and are primarily focused on what we believe are our three most efficient programs marketing to our existing owner base  marketing to consumers who purchased sampler packages  which are one year  prepaid rental packages allowing purchasers to experience the bluegreen vacation club prior to purchasing a full voi  and our bass pro shops marketing program 
historically  these marketing programs have been more effective and as a result have had lower cash marketing expenses 
we began to emphasize cash sales and higher down payments at the time of sale by refocusing our sales personnel through commission incentive programs 
we also have increased efforts to promote our existing day  same as cash program to encourage consumers to payoff their loans early 
we have eliminated over  staff positions  including seasonal associates  which we believe will significantly reduce resorts sg a and corporate sg a in based on the opening or acquisition of new resorts during and the expected completion of certain projects currently under development  we made a decision to materially reduce our inventory spending 
we believe that we have adequate timeshare inventory to satisfy our projected sales and  based on our decision to reduce sales levels for several years thereafter 
we are pursuing growth in our sales and marketing  resorts management  mortgage servicing and title businesses by seeking opportunities to use our core competencies in these areas to generate fee income by providing these services to third parties 
in addition  although sales levels will be decreased  we believe our resorts management business and mortgage portfolio are sources of recurring cash receipts 
our initial actions at bluegreen communities include we consolidated field operations  thereby eliminating sales  construction and or administrative activities at locations 
we created four regional sales offices  and instituted new policies with the goal of better distributing sales leads to our best performing sales associates 
we have eliminated those advertising programs which we believe have become less effective in the current market environment 
we implemented a centralized contact management group with the goal of improving the efficiency of our internet marketing campaigns  which we anticipate will over time become our primary marketing channel 
we have eliminated over of our sales  marketing  development and administrative associates compared to the beginning of  which we believe will significantly reduce communities sg a in as we have completed development of phases of our communities  we expect development expenditures in to be materially below expenditures in we have organized a real estate advisory services business and will be pursuing opportunities to use our core competencies to provide asset management  market research and other real estate consulting services to third parties on a fee basis 
we have a material amount of debt maturing or requiring partial repayment in  as well as facilities for which the advance period has or will expire 
we intend to seek to renew  extend or refinance our debt and we believe that the implementation of our strategic initiatives will best position us to address these matters with our existing and future lenders 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to renew  extend or refinance that debt 
further  we may seek to raise additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations or repay outstanding debt 
there is no assurance that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
in light of the current trading price of our common stock  financing involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders 
our levels of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on our operations  including the following i our significant cash requirements to service debt  reduce funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  as well as conditions in the credit markets  generally  ii our leverage position increases our vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures  iii the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures  credit agreements and other agreements relating to our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  make investments or pay cash dividends on or repurchase preferred or common stock  and iv our leverage position may limit funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
certain of our competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
the following is a discussion of our purchase and credit facilities that were important sources of our liquidity as of december  these facilities do not constitute all of our outstanding indebtedness as of december  our other indebtedness includes outstanding junior subordinated debentures  borrowings collateralized by real estate inventories that were not incurred pursuant to an ongoing credit facility and capital leases 
vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities off balance sheet arrangements we have historically chosen to monetize our receivables through various facilities and through periodic term securitization transactions  as these arrangements provide us with cash inflows both currently and in the future at what we believe to be competitive rates without adding leverage to our balance sheet or retaining recourse for losses on the receivables sold 
in addition  these sale transactions have historically generated gains on our income statement on a periodic basis  which would not be realized under a traditional financing arrangement 
as previously discussed  we made the decision to structure future sales of our notes receivable so that they are accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings 
recently  the term securitization market has had minimal activity and there can be no assurances that these types of transactions will be available in the future at acceptable cost  if at all 
based on our expected lower resorts sales pace  we believe that we will not need to enter into any new receivable financing facilities or term securitization transcations in  however there can be no assurances that this will be the case 
historically  we have been a party to a number of securitization type transactions  all of which in our opinion utilize customary structures and terms for transactions of this type 
in each securitization type transaction  we sold receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity which  in turn  sold the receivables either directly to third parties or to a trust established for the transaction 
in each transaction  the receivables were sold on a non recourse basis except for breaches of certain representations and warranties and the special purpose entity retained residual interest in the receivables sold 
we have acted as servicer of the receivables pools in each transaction for a fee  with the servicing obligations specified under the applicable transaction documents 
under the terms of the applicable transaction documents  the cash payments received from obligors on the receivables sold are distributed to the investors which  depending on the transaction  may acquire the receivables directly or purchase an interest in  or make loans secured by the receivables to  a trust that owns the receivables  parties providing services in connection with the facility  and our special purpose subsidiary as the holder of the retained interest in the receivables according to specified formulas 
in general  available funds are applied monthly to pay fees to service providers  make interest and principal payments to investors  fund required reserves  if any  and pay distributions in respect of the retained interests in the receivables 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction documents  however  to the extent the portfolio of receivables fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or other trigger events  the funds received from obligors are distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
in effect  during a period in which the accelerated payment formula is applicable  funds go to outside investors until they receive the full amount owed to them and only then are payments made to our subsidiary in its capacity as the holder of the retained interests 
depending on the circumstances and the transaction  the application of the accelerated payment formula may be permanent or temporary until the trigger event is cured 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow on the retained interests in the receivables would be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
such a reduction in cash flow could cause a decline in the fair value of our retained interests in the receivables sold 
declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to operations in the current period 
in each facility  the failure of the pool of receivables to comply with specified portfolio covenants can create a trigger event  which results in the use of the accelerated payment formula in certain circumstances until the trigger event is cured and in other circumstances permanently and  to the extent there was any remaining commitment to purchase receivables from our special purpose subsidiary  the suspension or termination of that commitment 
in addition  in each securitization type facility  certain breaches of our obligations as servicer or other events allow the indenture trustee to cause the servicing to be transferred to a substitute third party servicer 
in that case  our obligation to service the receivables would terminate and we would cease to receive a servicing fee 
the following is a summary of significant financial information related to our off balance sheet facilities and securitizations and the related on balance sheet retained interests during the periods presented below in thousands as of december  on balance sheet retained interests in notes receivable sold off balance sheet notes receivable sold without recourse principal balance owed to note receivable purchasers years ended december  income statement gain on sales of notes receivable interest accretion on retained interests in notes receivable sold servicing fee income includes amounts classified as voi sales  pursuant to sfas no

credit facilities for bluegreen s receivables and inventories in addition to the voi receivables purchase facilities discussed above  we maintain various credit facilities with financial institutions that provide receivable  acquisition and development financing for our operations

trust preferred securities offerings we have formed statutory business trusts collectively  the trusts and each issued trust preferred securities and invested the proceeds thereof in our junior subordinated debentures 
the trusts are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary as defined by fasb interpretation no 
r 
accordingly  we do not consolidate the operations of the trusts  instead  the trusts are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in each of these transactions  the applicable trust issued trust preferred securities as part of larger pooled trust securities offerings which were not registered under the securities act of the applicable trust then used the proceeds from issuing the trust preferred securities to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
interest on the junior subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly in arrears at the same interest rate 
distributions on the trust preferred securities are cumulative and based upon the liquidation value of the trust preferred security 
the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption 
the junior subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at the company s option at any time after five years from the issue date or sooner following certain specified events 
in addition  we made an initial equity contribution to each trust in exchange for its common securities  all of which are owned by us  and those proceeds were also used to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
the terms of each trust s common securities are nearly identical to the trust preferred securities 
we had the following junior subordinated debentures outstanding at december  dollars in thousands trust outstanding amount of junior subordinated debentures initial equity in trust issue date fixed interest rate variable interest rate beginning optional redemption date maturity date bluegreen statutory trust i month libor bluegreen statutory trust ii month libor bluegreen statutory trust iii month libor bluegreen statutory trust iv month libor bluegreen statutory trust v month libor bluegreen statutory trust vi month libor both the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures bear interest at a fixed interest rate from the issue date through the beginning optional redemption date 
both the trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures bear interest at a variable interest rate from the beginning optional redemption date through the maturity date 
initial equity in trust is recorded as part of other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
we currently intend to seek to create similar trusts and to participate in other pooled trust preferred securities transactions in the future as a source of additional financing  subject to market conditions and other considerations 
unsecured credit facility in august  we executed agreements to renew our unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  na and increase it from million to million 
subject to its terms and conditions  this line of credit is an available source of short term liquidity for us 
amounts borrowed under the line bear interest at day libor plus at december  
interest is due monthly  and all outstanding amounts are due on july  the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants and conditions typical of arrangements of this type 
during  we borrowed million under this line of credit for general corporate purposes 
as of december   based on outstanding borrowings and letters of credit  the remaining revolving availability under this line of credit was approximately million 
during we borrowed an additional million under the line of credit 
subsequent to this borrowing our remaining availability under this line of credit was approximately million 
commitments our material commitments as of december  included the required payments due on our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes payable  commitments to complete our bluegreen resorts and communities projects based on our sales contracts with customers and commitments under noncancelable operating leases 
the following tables summarize the contractual minimum principal and interest payments  respectively  required on all of our outstanding debt including our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes and debentures payable and our noncancelable operating leases by period date  as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total contractual obligations receivable backed notes payable lines of credit and notes payable jr 
subordinated debentures noncancelable operating leases total contractual obligations interest obligations receivable backed notes payable lines of credit and notes payable jr 
subordinated debentures total contractual interest total contractual obligations assumes that the interest rate on variable rate debt remains the same as the rate at december  we intend to use cash flow from operations  including cash received from the sale pledge of voi notes receivable  and cash received from new borrowings under existing or future debt facilities in order to satisfy the principal payments required on contractual obligations 
while this may not prove to be the case  we believe that we will be successful in renewing certain debt facilities and or obtaining extensions 
based on this and the expected positive impact on our financial position of the strategic initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of  we believe that we will be in a position to meet required debt payments when we expect them to be ultimately due  however there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we estimate that the cash required to complete resort buildings  resort amenities and other common costs in projects in which sales have occurred was approximately million as of december  we estimate that the total cash required to complete the phases of our bluegreen communities projects in which sales have occurred was approximately million as of december  these amounts assume that we are not obligated to develop any building  project or amenity in which a commitment has not been made through a sales contract to a customer  however  we anticipate that we will incur such obligations in the future 
we plan to fund these expenditures over the next three to five years  primarily with cash generated from operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate the cash from operations necessary to complete the foregoing plans or that actual costs will not exceed those estimated 
we believe that our existing cash  anticipated cash generated from operations  anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the purchase facilities and one or more replacement facilities we intend to put in place will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  subject to the successful implementation of ongoing strategic initiatives discussed above and the availability of credit 
we will be required to renew or replace credit and receivables purchase facilities that have expired or that will expire in the near term 
we will  in the future  also require additional credit facilities or will be required to issue corporate debt or equity securities 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  bear fixed or variable rate interest and may be subject to such terms as the lender may require and management believes acceptable 
there can be no assurance that the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired or which are scheduled to expire in the near term will be renewed or replaced or that sufficient funds will be available from operations or under existing  proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet our cash needs  including our debt service obligations 
to the extent we are not able to sell notes receivable or borrow under such facilities  our ability to satisfy our obligations would be materially adversely affected 
our credit facilities  indentures  and other outstanding debt instruments  and receivables purchase facilities include customary conditions to funding  eligibility requirements for collateral  cross default and other acceleration provisions  certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  the repurchase of securities  payment of dividends  investments in joint ventures and other restricted payments  the incurrence of liens  and transactions with affiliates  as well as covenants concerning net worth  fixed charge coverage requirements  debt to equity ratios  portfolio performance requirements and events of default or termination 
no assurance can be given that we will not be required to seek waivers of such covenants  that we will successful in obtaining waivers  or that such covenants will not limit our ability to raise funds  sell receivables  satisfy or refinance our obligations or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
in addition  our future operating performance and ability to meet our financial obligations will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which will be beyond our control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than us dollars during the year ended december  were approximately of consolidated revenues and consolidated assets  respectively 
sales generated by bluegreen properties  nv  our subsidiary in aruba  are transacted in us dollars 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not historically been significant to our operations or net assets 
interest rate risk we sold million  million and of fixed rate voi notes receivable off balance sheet during  and  respectively  under various vacation ownership receivable purchase facilities and term securitization transactions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
our gains on sale recognized are generally based upon either fixed or variable interest rates at the time of sale including the prevailing weighted average term treasury rate  commercial paper rates or libor rates depending on the purchase facility in effect and many other factors including  but not limited to the weighted average coupon rate and remaining contractual life of the loans sold  and assumptions regarding the constant prepayment rate  loss severity  annual default and discount rates 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the hypothetical change in fair value or our retained interest in notes receivable sold based on adverse changes in assumptions including discount rate 
as of december   we had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
in addition  our notes receivable from voi and homesite customers were comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of notes bearing floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates are based either upon the prevailing prime or libor interest rates 
for floating rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate financial instruments  interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
if interest rates increased or decreased one percentage point  the effect on interest expense related to our variable rate debt would be approximately million 
a similar change in interest rates would affect the total fair value of our fixed rate debt  by an immaterial amount 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  we would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate any exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
