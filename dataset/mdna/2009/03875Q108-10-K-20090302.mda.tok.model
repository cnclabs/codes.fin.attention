if our subsidiary in india is not successful  we may incur losses 
the success of our subsidiary in india may be dependent on our ability to attract and retain talented software developers 
the market for highly skilled workers in software development in india is becoming increasingly more competitive 
if we are unable to attract and retain employees  we may need to shut down the facility  and this could adversely impact our financial position and operating results 
if lump sum payments made to retiring participants in our defined benefit pension plans exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost in a calendar year  we would need to recognize the pro rata portion of unrecognized actuarial gain or loss equal to the percentage reduction of the projected benefit obligation  which may result in an adjustment that could materially reduce operating results 
our defined benefit pension plans allow participants to receive a lump sum distribution for benefits earned in lieu of annuity payments when they retire from arbitron 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  requires that if the lump sum distributions made for a calendar year exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost  we must recognize for that year s results of operations the pro rata portion of unrecognized

lump sum payments in our qualified pension plan exceeded the total of the service cost and the interest cost in this resulted in an expense of million for the year ended december  if lump sum payments in any of our pension plans again exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost  the adjustment could materially reduce operating results

we intend to begin transitioning operations and production of our radar service from our offices in new jersey to our headquarters in maryland during if any of the key employees instrumental in the production of the service leave or we are otherwise unable to replicate the service in maryland  it could adversely impact our results of operations 
risk factors relating to our indebtedness our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our financial flexibility  which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
on december   we entered into a five year  million revolving credit facility that contains financial terms  covenants and operating restrictions that could restrict our financial flexibility and could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 
these include the requirement that we maintain certain leverage and coverage ratios  and restrictions on our ability to sell certain assets  incur additional indebtedness and grant or incur liens on our assets 
these restrictions may limit or prohibit our ability to raise additional debt capital when needed or could prevent us from investing in other growth initiatives 
our ability to comply with these financial requirements and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control  and our inability to comply with them could result in a default under the terms of the agreement 
if a default occurs  either because we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service the debt or because we fail to comply with one or more of the restrictive covenants  the lenders could elect to declare all of the then outstanding borrowings  as well as accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  a default may result in the application of higher rates of interest on the amounts due  resulting in higher interest expense being incurred by us 
further  as discussed above in risk factors relating to our business and the industry in which we operate  continued or intensified disruption in the credit markets may adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facility  which could adversely affect our business 
risk factors relating to owning our common stock changes in market conditions  or sales of our common stock  could adversely impact the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock depends on various financial and market conditions  which may change from time to time and which are outside of our control 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  also could adversely impact prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition to the possibility that we may sell shares of our common stock in a public offering at any time  we also may issue shares of common stock in connection with grants of restricted stock or upon exercise of stock options that we grant to our directors  officers and employees 
all of these shares will be available for sale in the public markets from time to time 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  which could depress the stock price of our common stock 
delaware corporate law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of arbitron or the 
table of contents removal of existing management or directors and  as a result  could prevent our stockholders from being paid a premium for their common stock over the then prevailing market price 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these include a stockholders rights plan  which likely will limit  through november   the ability of a third party to acquire a substantial amount of our common stock without prior approval by the board of directors  restriction from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder under section of the delaware general corporation law  authorization to issue one or more classes of preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval  with rights senior to common stockholders  advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting  and requirement of a supermajority vote of percent of the stockholders to exercise the stockholders right to amend the bylaws 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains the following provisions  which could prevent transactions that are in the best interest of stockholders requirement of a supermajority vote of two thirds of the stockholders to approve some mergers and other business combinations  and restriction from engaging in a business combination with a controlling person unless either a modified supermajority vote is received or the business combination will result in the termination of ownership of all shares of our common stock and the receipt of consideration equal to at least fair market value

maryland on february  we announced that we had reached an agreement with the office of the attorney general of maryland regarding our ppm radio ratings services in the washington  dc and baltimore local markets

we are involved from time to time in a number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered ordinary with respect to the nature of our current and past operations  including employment related disputes  contract disputes  government proceedings  customer disputes  and tort claims 
in some proceedings  the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief  which  if granted  would require substantial expenditures on our part 
some of these matters raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues  and are subject to many uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the facts and circumstances of each particular action  and the jurisdiction  forum and law under which each action is pending 
because of this complexity  final disposition of some of these proceedings may not occur for several years 
as such  we are not always able to estimate the amount of our possible future liabilities 
there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of present or future established accruals or insurance coverage 
although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur  we believe that the likelihood that final disposition of these proceedings will  considering the merits of the claims  have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations is remote

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that follow in this annual report on form k 
overview historically  our quantitative radio ratings services and related software have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenue 
our radio audience ratings services represented percent  percent  and percent of our total revenue in   and  respectively 
the related software revenues represented nine percent of our total revenue in each of   and while we expect that our quantitative radio ratings services and related software will continue to account for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future  we are actively seeking opportunities to diversify our revenue base by  among other things  leveraging the investment we have made in our ppm technology by exploring applications of the technology beyond our domestic radio ratings business 
we have entered into multi year agreements with many of our largest customers  including agreements for ppm based ratings as we commercialize the service in the ppm markets 
these agreements generally provide for a higher license fee for ppm based ratings than we charge for diary based ratings 
as a result  we expect that the percentage of our revenues derived from our radio ratings and related software is likely to increase as we commercialize the ppm service 
growth in revenue is expected for  in particular  due to a full year impact of revenue recognized for the ppm markets commercialized in the latter half of  as well as the partial year impact related to the ppm markets scheduled for commercialization at various times during the full revenue impact of the launch is also not expected to occur in the first year of commercialization for each of these markets because our customer contracts allow for phased in pricing toward the higher ppm service rate over a period of time 
the signing of cumulus and clear channel with nielsen for the radio ratings service in certain small to mid sized markets is anticipated to adversely impact our expected revenue by approximately million in and thereafter the impact will be approximately million per year on our expected annual revenue 
due to the current economic downturn s impact on anticipated sales of discretionary services  as well as the high penetration of our current services in the radio station business  we expect that our future annual organic rate of revenue growth from our quantitative diary based radio ratings services will be slower than historical trends 
our net revenue growth for is expected to approximate the same percentage rate of growth as that of we depend on a limited number of key customers for our radio ratings services and related software 
for example  in  clear channel represented percent of our total revenue 
the agreement between clear channel and us for services in markets outside of the ppm markets in which clear channel operates  as well as the national radar service  expired on december  these services accounted for approximately seven percent of our revenue 
we are currently in negotiations with clear channel regarding new license agreements for all clear channel stations whose contracts have expired 
we cannot provide any assurances that we could replace the revenue that would be lost if any of our key customers failed to review all or part of their agreements with us 
the loss of any key customer would materially impact our business  financial position  and operating results 
because many of our largest customers own and operate radio stations in markets that we expect to transition to ppm measurement  we expect that our dependence on our largest customers will continue for the foreseeable future 
commercialization of our ppm radio ratings service has and will continue to require a substantial financial investment 
we believe our cash generated from operations  as well as access to our existing credit facility  is sufficient to fund such requirements 
we currently estimate that the capital expenditures associated with the ppm 
table of contents service in will be approximately million 
as we have anticipated  our efforts to support the commercialization of our ppm ratings service have had a material negative impact on our results of operations 
the amount of capital required for deployment of our ppm ratings service and the impact on our results of operations will be greatly affected by the speed of the commercialization 
we anticipate that ppm costs and expenses will accelerate six to nine months in advance of the commercialization of each ppm market as we build the panels 
these costs are incremental to the costs associated with our diary based ratings service 
our cell phone only household recruitment initiatives in both the diary and ppm services will also increase our cost of revenue 
growth in revenue and earnings per share remain our most important financial goals 
protecting and supporting our existing customer base  ensuring our products and services are competitive from a price  quality and service perspective and generating financial returns are critical components to this overall goal 
there can be no guarantees that we will be able to restore operating margins to historical levels 
we continue to operate in a highly challenging business environment in the markets and industries we serve 
our future performance will be impacted by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in these markets and industries  including our ability to continue to maintain and improve our ppm service  and manage increased costs for data collection  arising among other ways  from increased numbers of cell phone only households  which are more expensive to recruit than households with landline phones 
we will also seek to pursue mrc accreditation in all of our ppm markets  and develop and implement effective and efficient technological solutions to measure multimedia and advertising 
general economic conditions our clients derive most of their revenue from transactions involving the sale or purchase of advertising 
during challenging economic times  advertisers may reduce advertising expenditures  impacting advertising agencies and media 
as a result  advertising agencies and media may be less likely to purchase our services 
continued market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns  which also may lead to lower demand for our services  increased incidence of customers inability to pay their accounts  an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts  an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable  or insolvency of our customers 
during the fourth quarter of and into  we have observed an increase in the average number of days our sales have been outstanding before we have received payment and have received some requests for pricing concessions from our customers 
lawsuits and governmental interactions during  we were involved in a number of significant civil actions and governmental interactions primarily related to the commercialization of our ppm service 
for additional information regarding the company s legal interactions  see item legal proceedings 
the net legal costs and expenses incurred by us in connection with these matters have been material 
we can provide no assurance that we will not continue to incur legal costs and expenses at comparable rates in the future 
discontinued operation on january   we sold the continental research business 
additional information regarding the sale is provided in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
project apollo affiliate termination we formed project apollo llc project apollo with nielsen to explore the commercialization of a national marketing research service with the objective of providing multimedia exposure data combined with sales data from a single source to produce a measure of advertising effectiveness 
on february   we announced that we and nielsen  as sole members  had agreed to terminate project apollo 
of the million recognized by us for our share of the net costs incurred by project apollo for the year ended december   million relates to its wind down and liquidation  which was completed by june  we expect to continue investing in and developing 
table of contents opportunities that leverage our existing ppm technologies and that allow us to continue to pursue multi media solutions for audience measurement 
impact of hurricane ike we are in the process of assessing the losses incurred from storm damage and business interruption in houston and the surrounding areas within the hurricane ike impact zone 
as a result of the relocation of sample respondents and lack of essential services during and following the hurricane  houston galveston ppm data was issued for only three of the four weeks in the september survey and two of the four weeks in the october survey 
we estimate a related revenue loss of approximately million 
due to the permanent closing of our houston call center  which suffered heavy storm damage  additional labor costs were incurred as more shifts were run at our other call centers in order to replace the lost capacity 
we estimate that the business interruption costs associated with the storm were approximately million 
we believe that million of the million aggregate loss for hurricane ike are recoverable through insurance proceeds 
stock repurchases on november   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million in shares of our outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions at then prevailing market prices through november  as of february    shares of common stock had been repurchased under this program for million 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that both are important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations  and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
we capitalize software development costs with respect to significant internal use software initiatives or enhancements in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the costs are capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed and management considers it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended  until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use 
once the software is placed in service  the capitalized costs are amortized over periods of three to five years 
we perform an assessment quarterly to determine if it is probable that all capitalized software will be used to perform its intended function 
if an impairment exists  the software cost is written down to estimated fair value 
as of december   and  our capitalized software developed for internal use had carrying amounts of million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  of software related to the ppm service 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine the current provision for income taxes and also deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
changes in tax law or interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account forecasts of the amount and nature of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and nature of income in future years could render current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause actual income tax obligations to differ from estimates  thus impacting our financial position and results of operations

we expect to submit claims for two insurance recoveries 
the first involves a number of legal matters and governmental actions for which we have incurred a material amount of legal costs and expenses 
we estimated that million of these costs and expenses are recoverable through insurance proceeds 
this amount is recorded in prepaid and other current assets as of december  we also recorded a million insurance recovery in prepaids and other current assets as of december   related to damages and business interruption losses incurred during hurricane ike 
it is possible that the actual recoveries related to these events will be greater or less than our estimates

dollars in thousands cost of revenue selling  general  and administrative research and development total costs and expenses revenue 
revenue increased for the year ended december   as compared to  due primarily to the commercialization of additional ppm markets during  a full year of currency revenue associated with the houston galveston and philadelphia markets commercialized in the first half of  and increases related to the radio ratings subscriber base  contract renewals  and price escalations in multiyear customer contracts for our ppm service and diary based quantitative rating business 
during the last three years  our efforts to support the commercialization of our ppm ratings service have had a material negative impact on our results of operations 
despite the growth in revenue for the year ended december   we anticipate that we will continue to incur additional costs related to the continued commercialization of the ppm service across the various ppm markets 
in  we expect to commercialize ppm markets 
despite the increase in revenue that is anticipated from this increased commercialization  the full impact of commercialization on our anticipated revenue does not occur in the first year of commercialization for each individual market 
this is because these markets are scheduled to commercialize throughout the year and our customer contracts allow for phased in pricing toward the higher ppm service rate over a period of time 
the signing of cumulus and clear channel with nielsen for the radio ratings service in certain small to mid sized markets is anticipated to adversely impact our expected revenue by approximately million in and thereafter the impact will be approximately million per year on our expected annual revenue 

table of contents cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased by for the year ended december   as compared to the increase in cost of revenue was largely attributable to a million increase associated with our ppm ratings service  which was due primarily to increased costs related to additional markets commercialized in and certain markets expected to be commercialized in the increase in cost of revenue for  as compared to  also includes a million increase in costs spent on initiatives in support of our diary rating business 
we expect that our cost of revenue will continue to increase as a result of our efforts to support the continued commercialization of the ppm service over the next two years

net income was also negatively impacted by certain lawsuits and governmental interactions occurring in  a portion of which is not expected to be covered by insurance  as well as cost and expenses related to pension settlements recognized under sfas no

equity in net income of affiliates 
equity in net income of affiliates relating collectively to scarborough and project apollo decreased by for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due primarily to the formation of project apollo in february our share of the project apollo affiliate loss was million and our share of scarborough s income increased by million for  as compared to interest income 
interest income decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in due to lower average cash and short term investment balances  which were partially offset by higher interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to our prepayment of our senior secured notes obligation on october  in accordance with the provisions of the note agreement  we were obligated to pay an additional make whole interest amount of million as a result of the prepayment 
borrowings under our new revolving credit facility did not commence until the fourth quarter of as a result  outstanding borrowings on average and the related interest expense were significantly lower during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations decreased for the year ended december   from the same period in  due primarily to planned expenses required to build our ppm rollout panels for the philadelphia  new york  chicago  and los angeles markets  and to support the strategic development of our ppm ratings business 
incremental expenses incurred in support of our diary ratings service and our project apollo national marketing research service also contributed to the decrease in income from continuing operations  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with our prepayment of our senior secured notes obligation in ebit and ebitda

table of contents liquidity and capital resources comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  working capital  which is the amount by which our current assets exceed are less than our current liabilities  was million and million as of december   and  respectively 
excluding the deferred revenue liability  which does not require a significant additional cash outlay  working capital was million and million as of december   and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million as of december   and  respectively 
we expect that our cash position as of december   cash flow generated from operations  and our available revolving credit facility credit facility will be sufficient to support our operations for the next to months 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of this million decrease in operating activities  a million change is associated with increased accounts receivable balances  which resulted from both higher ppm service billings recorded in conjunction with the commercialization of ppm markets in the latter half of  and also from decreased collections from our customers in the midst of a declining economy  which has had an adverse impact on the radio industry 
because ppm derived surveys deliver more frequently than diary surveys  revenue was recognized sooner for the ppm markets commercialized in than historical trends and consequently  a million change in deferred revenue occurred for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by operating activities also reflects a million increase in prepaids and other current assets  which consists largely of a million insurance claim receivable recorded in for cost recoveries related to certain legal matters  governmental interactions  and hurricane ike business interruption loss and damages 
these reductions in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a million increase in cash flows from operating activities related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities  which was comprised primarily of a million fluctuation in payroll  bonus  and benefit accruals during both and  a million accrual elimination in related to the expiration of project apollo cost sharing arrangements  and a million increase associated with accrued taxes 
in addition  operating activities were impacted by a million increase in depreciation related to increased ppm equipment capital expenditures for  as compared to net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to million of net short term investment sales made during no investment purchases or sales activity occurred during prior to the end of  all of our short term investments were sold to help fund the completion of our then authorized million stock repurchase program 
for further information regarding the impact to our consolidated financial statements of our stock repurchase programs  see the discussion of the net financing activities below 
the change in cash flow associated with investing activities was also impacted by a million increase in capital spending in  primarily related to ppm equipment and ppm related software capitalization  as well as machinery and equipment purchased in conjunction with expanding our research and development subsidiary in india 
these cash outflows were partially offset by a million net cash inflow related to our discontinued operation ie  continental

net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this million decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due largely to million in increased net borrowings under our credit facility to assist our cash flow from operations with funding our stock repurchase program in as compared to this decrease in net cash used was partially offset by a reduction in proceeds from stock option exercises resulting primarily from a decrease in our average stock price during the latter half of on december   we entered into an agreement with a consortium of lenders to provide up to million of financing to us through a five year  unsecured revolving credit facility 
the agreement contains an expansion feature for us to increase the total financing available under the credit facility to million with such increased financing to be provided by one or more existing credit facility lending institutions  subject to the 
table of contents approval of the lending banks  and or in combination with one or more new lending institutions  subject to the approval of the credit facility s administrative agent 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is calculated based on a floating rate for a duration of up to six months as selected by us 
our credit facility contains financial terms  covenants and operating restrictions that potentially restrict our financial flexibility 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are required to maintain certain leverage and coverage ratios and meet other financial conditions 
the agreement potentially limits  among other things  our ability to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness  and grant or incur liens on our assets 
under the terms of the credit facility  all of our material domestic subsidiaries  if any  guarantee the commitment 
currently  we do not have any material domestic subsidiaries as defined under the terms of the credit facility 
although we do not believe that the terms of our credit facility limit the operation of our business in any material respect  the terms of the credit facility may restrict or prohibit our ability to raise additional debt capital when needed or could prevent us from investing in other growth initiatives 
our outstanding borrowings increased from million at december   to million at december  to supplement our cash flow from operations in the funding of our outstanding stock repurchase program 
we have been in compliance with the terms of the credit facility since the agreement s inception 
as of february   we had million in outstanding debt under the credit facility 
on november   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million in shares of our outstanding common stock through either periodic open market or private transactions at then prevailing market prices over a period of up to two years through november  as of february    shares of outstanding common stock had been repurchased under this program for million 
in and  the board continued to approve the payment of quarterly dividends of 
per common share to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on the th of each quarter end month 
for and  a quarterly dividend payment was made in the month following each quarter end 
there is no assurance that the quarterly dividend will continue 
commercialization of our ppm radio ratings service requires and will continue to require a substantial financial investment 
we believe our cash generated from operations  as well as access to the credit facility  is sufficient to fund such requirements for the next to months 
we currently estimate that the capital expenditures related to the ppm service will be approximately million 
the amount of capital required for further deployment of our ppm ratings service and the impact on our results of operations will be greatly affected by the speed of commercialization 
we anticipate that ppm costs and expenses will accelerate six to nine months in advance of the commercialization of each ppm market as we build the panels 
these costs are incremental to the costs associated with our diary based ratings service 
cell phone only household recruitment initiatives in both the diary and ppm services will also increase our cost of revenue

there were no short term investments as of december  short term investments was million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly attributable to a million decrease in income from continuing operations  which resulted primarily from planned costs required to build panels for the commercialization of the ppm service  and a million fluctuation for reduced accruals related to payroll and bonus costs for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the decreases in cash previously mentioned were partially offset by a million fluctuation associated with prior year net purchases of ppm international inventory as compared to a reduction during and a million net increase in depreciation and amortization caused by increased capitalization of ppm equipment

net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the million fluctuation was driven primarily by our million debt repayment made during the quarter ended december   of our then outstanding senior secured note obligation as compared with million of net borrowings in the year ended december   under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  a million increase in proceeds was received from stock option exercises for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  which was the result of higher average stock prices during the first six months of the year ended december  these increases in cash flow were partially offset by the million increase in stock repurchases
