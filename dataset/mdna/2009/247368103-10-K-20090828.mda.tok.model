item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook although the retail climate for apparel sales remains very difficult  we believe that we can continue to strengthen our business results during fiscal year our competitive position in our activewear segment continues to improve as we gained market share in our catalog business and full packaged products during fiscal year while we expect 
table of contents undecorated tees to remain in an over supply situation  we believe that we offer a higher level of service than our competitors and have developed marketing programs that should entice customers to grow their business with us 
our retail ready segment continues to build business relationships  expanding the number of customers and doors where our products are sold to our ultimate consumer 
we believe we can continue to grow organically as we leverage our customer relationships across our business groups 
we have already received orders to begin shipping headwear into our military distribution channels and have received apparel orders at to the game based on our ability to offer a vertical supply chain with apparel products 
our soffe and junkfood products are retailing well  and we expect additional orders as open to buy dollars become available 
our internet sales of soffe and junkfood products continue to increase  a further reflection of the strength of our brands and license agreements 
we expect that our new business relationships and additional licenses that we have in place  will drive growth in fiscal year each of our businesses is now marketing products to be produced in our central america manufacturing operations 
by the end of calendar year  we expect to be shipping apparel products through each of our business units from this manufacturing platform  including new apparel business generated from to the game 
although we plan to continue to reduce our production rates on delta catalog tees to match current demand  we expect that a significant portion of this capacity will be used to supply our soffe demand  which will reduce our unscheduled downtime 
in addition  we expect to purchase specialized fabric finishing equipment which will allow us to produce certain fabrics that we currently purchase on the open market  further leveraging our fixed costs in our facilities and reducing our lead times 
we believe that our low cost  flexible supply platform will allow us to continue to provide competitively priced products to our retail partners  while building our overall operating margins 
overall we plan to focus on four strategic initiatives during fiscal that we believe are important in the continued growth and success of our company 
leverage our current business strengths 
we are focusing on using license agreements across all of our business units to support new channels of distribution and to increase our value adding services  including printing and specialized packaging 
we believe this focus will enable us to build business in new channels of distribution while increasing brand and product penetration in existing channels 
improve profitability in our activewear segment 
we are working on improving our marketing and merchandising strategy to continue to build our market share in these businesses 
in addition  utilizing our manufacturing plants to support all of our business units should improve our cost structure  driving improved operating margins 
consolidate and improve our information technology platforms 
we have invested a significant amount of capital over the past two years to improve our distribution  inventory and business operating platforms 
many of these new systems are expected to be implemented during fiscal year and should improve efficiencies across our business units  lower our costs and allow for better management of our inventories 
reduce inventory levels 
we made progress on inventory reduction during fiscal year however  we believe that we can further improve our inventory turns with the new business systems being implemented  allowing us to further grow sales without expanding our investment in inventory 
we are also focusing on improving our speed to market  which should provide a higher level of service to our retail and brand partners with lower inventory levels 
earnings guidance we expect further expansion of revenue and improved profitability for our business in fiscal year after considering the heightened risk and uncertainty in the apparel marketplace  we expect fiscal year sales to be in the range of to million and earnings to be in the range of to per diluted share 
the overall retail climate for apparel remains difficult  and we anticipate further closings of retail apparel outlets 
while consumer demand has been solid for our products  this could weaken at any time 
as we match our manufacturing production to demand  weakening sales may require us to further reduce output  thereby increasing per unit costs and lowering our margins 
in addition  raw material and energy prices remain volatile and could also result in increased costs 
while it is impossible to predict the extent these conditions may impact our business  we believe that we have evaluated these heightened risk factors in setting our expectations for fiscal year 
table of contents results of operations overview we are pleased with our results in fiscal year and the milestones we reached during the year 
while the retail demand for apparel has been weak over the past year  each of our business units achieved organic growth 
this  combined with our acquisition of to the game  resulted in record sales of million  an increase of from the prior year 
our manufacturing facilities made significant improvements during the year  increasing output through efficiencies  improving material utilization and reducing off quality production 
during our fourth quarter  we successfully moved the soffe textile production into our maiden  north carolina and ceiba textiles facilities and closed the textile operations in fayetteville  north carolina 
this should further reduce cost and eliminate the duplication of overhead  saving us approximately million on an annual basis 
our operating profit was million  or of sales  in fiscal year  resulting in net income of million  or per diluted share 
in addition to earning solid profits in fiscal year  we continued to focus on managing the capital in the business 
our days sales outstanding at june improved to days compared to days a year ago 
we continued to focus on our inventory management  achieving an organic sales growth with lower inventories excluding the additional inventory associated with to the game 
our finished goods turns improved to turns from turns in the prior year 
we used the cash generated from our earnings and reduction in working capital to reduce our debt levels by million 
this was in addition to using million of cash related to the acquisition of to the game 
overall  we believe that our various marketing platforms and targeted channels of distribution served us well  yielding solid growth with prudent capital management in a difficult apparel marketplace 
quarterly financial data for information regarding quarterly financial data  refer to note quarterly financial information unaudited to the consolidated financial statements  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
fiscal year versus fiscal year fiscal year net sales increased to million  a million increase from fiscal year the sales improvement resulted from organic growth of approximately  with each of our business units contributing to the increase  combined with sales from to the game  which was acquired on march  activewear sales increased to million driven from volume growth and from delivering a higher percentage of units as decorated  retail ready full package products 
sales in the retail ready segment were million in fiscal year  a increase from the prior year 
excluding to the game  sales in the segment increased approximately for the full year 
we believe that the strength of our brands and licenses  along with our diverse customer base within the businesses  allowed us to achieve sales growth in one of the most difficult years at retail 
gross profit improved basis points to of net sales in fiscal year from in the prior year 
we expensed a total of million in the second half of fiscal year from our manufacturing downtimes  lowering gross margins by about basis points 
the prior year gross margins included million of restructuring related expenses  lowering margins in the prior year by basis points 
during fiscal year  we achieved a basis point improvement in the gross margins in our activewear segment  a step towards achieving the margins we expect in these businesses 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude them from gross margin and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  an improvement from of sales in the prior year 
in fiscal year  we closed our andalusia distribution facility and consolidated these products into our west coast distribution facility  lowering our distribution costs 
in addition  our bad debt expense was lower in fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  two of our customers filed bankruptcy  increasing bad debt expense by million 
selling costs as a percentage of net sales are typically higher in the retail ready segment primarily due to additional staffing  higher commissions  royalty expense on licensed products  and increased advertising expenses associated with selling branded products 

table of contents our operating profit was million  or of sales  in fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal year resulting from the factors described above 
the retail ready segment contributed million in operating income  and the activewear segment had a million operating loss 
included in fiscal year was million in restructuring related charges 
other income for fiscal years and was million  primarily related to the green valley joint venture 
net interest expense for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from million for fiscal year the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a reduction in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt 
during fiscal year  our average interest rate was compared to in the prior year 
our fiscal year effective income tax rate was  compared to in fiscal year in fiscal year  we completed a change in the legal structure of soffe from a corporation to a limited liability company 
this change allows us to use delta apparel s state net operating loss carryforwards  and therefore we reversed a portion of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance  resulting in a tax benefit of million  which was recognized during the second quarter of fiscal year due to the small loss in fiscal year  the effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
our effective tax rate is subject to significant changes based on the jurisdiction and the percentage of earnings and losses in domestic and foreign taxable and tax free locations relative to the total pre tax income loss in a given period 
net income for fiscal year was million  a million increase from our net loss of million in fiscal year fiscal year versus fiscal year net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of million  or  from net sales of million in fiscal year the retail ready segment contributed million in net sales  compared to million in fiscal year sales in the soffe business declined compared to the prior year while junkfood generated growth of over the prior year 
lower consumer spending hurt sales in the soffe business  as our customers took a more cautious approach with their orders 
net sales in the activewear segment were million  an increase of million  or  due to increased funtees sales offset partially by a decrease in the delta catalog business 
fiscal year included results from the funtees business since its acquisition on october  sales in funtees declined during fiscal year due in part from lower orders for the fall  holiday and spring seasons  which we believe was caused primarily by disruptions during the integration of funtees into our maiden textile facility 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal year from in the prior year 
pricing in the catalog business increased during fiscal year  however  these price increases were offset by higher cotton  energy and transportation costs 
in addition  changes in our mix of products sold lowered our overall margins 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold and we exclude them from gross margin and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we had two customers file bankruptcy  increasing bad debt expense by million 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to lower management incentive expenses 
selling costs as a percentage of net sales are higher in the retail ready segment primarily due to additional staffing  higher commissions  royalty expense on licensed products  and increased advertising expenses associated with selling branded apparel products 
operating income for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily the result of the factors described above 
for fiscal year  the retail ready segment contributed million in operating income  and the activewear segment had a million operating loss  which included million in restructuring related expenses 
fiscal year included million in restructuring related charges 
other income for fiscal year was million  primarily related to the green valley joint venture 
other expense for fiscal year was not material 

table of contents net interest expense for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal year the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the higher debt levels resulting from the completion of the ceiba textiles facility as well as increased working capital requirements 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year was  compared to for fiscal year due to the small loss in fiscal year  the effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
in fiscal year  we donated the fayette  alabama facility to a charitable organization and recognized a million tax benefit 
in addition  profits that are permanently reinvested in the tax free zone of honduras further increased our effective tax benefit in fiscal year in fiscal year  we donated our knoxville  tennessee distribution facility to a charitable organization 
this  along with having a portion of our earnings in the tax free zone of honduras  lowered our effective tax rate from statutory rates 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an extraordinary gain associated with the final earnout payment made to the former m 
j 
soffe shareholders 
this extraordinary gain  net of taxes  was million  or per diluted share 
due to the factors described above  net loss for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million from net income of million for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources credit facility and other financial obligations on september   delta apparel  junkfood and soffe entered into a third amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended loan agreement with wachovia bank  national association  as agent  and the financial institutions named in the amended loan agreement as lenders 
pursuant to the amended loan agreement  the maturity of the loans under the previous credit facility was extended to september   and the line of credit available was increased to million subject to borrowing base limitations based on the value and type of collateral provided 
on march   we invoked the accordion feature in the amended loan agreement  increasing the maximum line of credit from million to million and adding pnc bank  national association to the syndicate of lenders under the facility with a million commitment 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the real and personal property of delta apparel  junkfood  soffe and to the game 
all loans under the credit agreement bear interest at rates based on either an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin or a bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin 
the facility requires monthly installment payments of approximately million in connection with fixed asset amortizations  and these amounts reduce the amount of availability under the facility 
annual facility fees are 
of the amount by which million exceeds the average daily principal balance of the outstanding loans and letters of credit accommodations and are charged monthly based on the principal balances during the immediately preceding month 
our credit facility includes the financial covenant that if the amount of availability falls below million  our fixed charge coverage ratio fccr as defined in the amended loan agreement for the preceding month period must not be less than to and otherwise includes customary conditions to funding  covenants  and events of default 
as of june   our fccr was for the preceding months  thus exceeding the to requirement allowing access to  if needed  the total amount of availability provided for under the amended loan agreement 
we expect to continue to meet the fccr for fiscal year at june   we had million outstanding under our credit facility  at an average interest rate of  and had the ability to borrow an additional million 
proceeds of the loans may be used for general operating  working capital  and other corporate purposes  and to finance fees and expenses under the facility 
the credit facility contains a subjective acceleration clause and a springing lockbox arrangement as defined in eitf  whereby remittances from customers will be forwarded to our general bank account and will not reduce the outstanding debt until and unless a specified event or an event of default occurs 
pursuant to eitf  we classify borrowings under the facility as non current debt 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and an interest rate collar agreement to manage our interest rate exposure and effectively reduce the impact of future interest changes 
both agreements mature or expire on april  by entering into the interest rate swap agreement  we effectively converted million of floating rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed obligation with a libor rate at 
by entering into the interest rate collar agreement  we effectively provided a cap of and a floor of on libor rates on million of floating rate debt under our credit facility 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converted million of floating rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed obligation with a libor rate of 
this agreement will mature 
table of contents or expire on april  we have assessed these agreements and concluded that the swaps and collar match the exact terms of the underlying debt to which they are related and therefore are considered perfectly effective hedges 
during the quarter ended september   we made the final debt payment of million to the former junkfood shareholders pursuant to the asset purchase agreement dated as of august  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a loan agreement with banco ficohsa  a honduran bank  for our capital expansion in honduras 
the loan is secured by a first priority lien on the assets of our honduran operations 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the loan was amended to a fixed interest rate of through june  at which time the interest rate increases to for the remainder of the term 
the loan is payable monthly  has a five year term and is denominated in us dollars 
at june   we had million outstanding on this loan 
pursuant to the first amendment to amended and restated stock purchase agreement related to the october soffe acquisition  amounts were payable to the prior shareholders of soffe if specified financial performance targets were met by m 
j 
soffe co 
during the annual period beginning on october  and ending on september  the earnout amount 
the earnout amount was capped at a maximum aggregate amount of million and was payable five business days subsequent to the filing of the form q for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year based on the financial performance achieved  we paid the final earnout amount of million to the prior shareholders of soffe in november we recorded an extraordinary gain of million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  associated with the final earnout payment 
as part of the consideration for the acquisition of junkfood  additional amounts were payable to the junkfood sellers if performance targets were met by junkfood during the period beginning on august  and ending on july  and during each of the three fiscal years thereafter ending on june  the earnout provisions 
these amounts were payable in the first quarter of the fiscal year subsequent to attaining the performance target 
related to the earnout period ended july   million was earned in accordance to the earnout provisions and subsequently paid in the first quarter of fiscal year related to the earnout period ended june   million was earned in accordance to the earnout provisions and subsequently paid during the first quarter of fiscal year based on the financial performance of junkfood in fiscal year  no earnout payment will be made related to the earnout period ended june  our primary cash needs are for working capital and capital expenditures 
in addition  in the future we may use cash to fund share repurchases under our stock repurchase program or to pay dividends 
derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rates 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for purposes of trading or speculation 
when we enter into a derivative instrument  we determine whether hedge accounting can be applied 
where hedge accounting can be applied  a hedge relationship is designated as either a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
the hedge is documented at inception  detailing the particular risk objective and strategy considered for undertaking the hedge 
the documentation identifies the specific asset or liability being hedged  the risk being hedged  the type of derivative used and how effectiveness of the hedge will be assessed 
as described above  on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and an interest rate collar agreement to manage our interest rate exposure and effectively reduce the impact of future interest rate changes 
we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement on april  we have assessed these agreements and have concluded that each met the requirements to account for each as a hedge 
changes in the derivatives fair values are deferred and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of income taxes  until the underlying transaction is recorded 
when the hedged item affects income  gains or losses are reclassified from aoci to the consolidated statements of operations as interest income expense 
any ineffectiveness in our hedging relationships is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of operations 
the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap and collar agreements resulted in aoci  net of taxes  of a loss of million as of june  and aoci  net of taxes  of a loss of million as of june  operating cash flows operating activities for fiscal year provided million in cash compared to million in cash used by operating activities for fiscal year cash flow from operating activities in fiscal year was primarily due to increased sales and profitability as well as working capital management 
our cash used by operating activities in fiscal year was primarily due to our net loss combined with the unfavorable increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales in the 
table of contents fourth quarter in comparison to the previous year as well as having slower collections from our customers 
changes in working capital are primarily monitored by analysis of the investment in accounts receivable and inventories and by the amount of accounts payable 
investing cash flows cash used by investing activities for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year cash expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment for fiscal year were million 
these expenditures were primarily to improve our distribution  inventory and business operating systems 
during fiscal year  we used million in cash for purchases of property  plant and equipment  primarily related to the investment in ceiba textiles and upgrades in information technology systems 
we spent a total of million on our ceiba textiles facility during fiscal year we expect to spend million to million on the purchase of property  plant and equipment during fiscal year effective on march   we completed the to the game acquisition  paying million  net of cash received  for the business and related acquisition costs 
in addition  during the first quarter of fiscal year  we paid million to the former junkfood shareholders related to the earnout period ended june  financing activities cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we used our cash from operating activities  net of our investing activities  to reduce our debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and make our principal payments on our loan with banco ficohsa 
in fiscal year  the cash provided by financing activities primarily came from our credit facility for use in operating and investing activities and to pay million of the junkfood seller note 
in fiscal year we also obtained additional funding from banco ficohsa for the investment in ceiba textiles in honduras 
our credit facility contains limitations on  or prohibitions of  cash dividends 
we are allowed to make cash dividends in amounts such that the aggregate amount paid to shareholders since may  does not exceed twenty five percent of our cumulative net income calculated from may  to the date of determination 
at june  and june   there was million and million  respectively  of retained earnings free of restrictions for the payment of dividends 
we paid no dividends to our shareholders in fiscal year and paid million in dividends in fiscal year future liquidity and capital resources based on our expectations  we believe that our credit facility should be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable working capital needs  and that the cash flow generated by our operations and funds available under our credit line should be sufficient to service our debt payment requirements  to satisfy our day to day working capital needs and to fund our planned capital expenditures 
any material deterioration in our results of operations  however  may result in our losing the ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and to issue letters of credit to suppliers or may cause the borrowing availability under our facility to be insufficient for our needs 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations  as of june   by future period 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt a operating leases letters of credit purchase obligations total 
table of contents a we exclude interest payments from these amounts because the cash outlay for the interest is unknown and can not be reliably estimated because the majority of the debt is under a revolving credit facility 
interest payments will be determined based upon the daily outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility and the prevailing interest rate during that time 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as defined by item a of regulation s k promulgated by the sec other than the letters of credit  operating leases  and purchase obligations described above 
we have entered into derivative interest rate contracts as described and included below in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report 
dividends and purchases of our own shares future cash dividend payments or purchases of our own shares will largely depend on our earnings  financial condition  capital requirements  compliance with loan covenants and other relevant factors 
our credit facility permits the payment of cash dividends in amounts such that the aggregate amount paid to shareholders since may  does not exceed twenty five percent of our cumulative net income calculated from may  to the date of determination 
at june   there was million of retained earnings free of restrictions for the payment of dividends 
during the fiscal year ended june   we did not purchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 
since the inception of the program  we have purchased  shares of our stock under the program at a total cost of million 
we currently have authorization from our board of directors to spend up to million for share repurchases under the stock repurchase program  of which million remains available for share repurchases 
all purchases are made at the discretion of our management 
dividend program on april   our board of directors adopted a quarterly dividend program 
on october   the board of directors elected to suspend payment of our quarterly dividend on common stock 
we paid million in dividends during fiscal year no cash dividends were paid in fiscal year critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of receivable and inventory reserves  self insurance accruals and the accounting for income taxes 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  title has transferred to the customer  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our sales are shipped fob shipping point and revenue is therefore recognized when the goods are shipped to the customer 
for sales that are shipped fob destination point  we do not recognize the revenue until the goods are received by the customer 
sales are recorded net of discounts and provisions for estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis by considering historical results and current trends 
we record these costs as a reduction to net sales 

table of contents we estimate the net collectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment 
specifically  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
our customers are managing their cash flows tightly  a trend we expect to continue in fiscal year significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
inventories our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for damaged  excess and out of style or otherwise obsolete inventory based on our historical selling prices for these products  current market conditions  and our forecast of product demand for the next twelve months 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if sell through of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
self insurance our medical  prescription and dental care benefits are primarily self insured 
our self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we develop estimates of claims incurred but not reported based upon the historical time it takes for a claim to be reported and historical claim amounts 
if claims are greater than we originally estimate  or if costs increase beyond what we have anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  which could have a significant impact on our operating results 
we had self insurance reserves of approximately  and  at june  and june   respectively 
net claims paid during fiscal year were less than those paid during fiscal year  resulting in the lower reserve balance at the end of fiscal year share based compensation share based compensation cost is determined using the fair value method as prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
we determine the fair value of each stock option at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
this model requires that we estimate a risk free interest rate  the volatility of the price of our common stock  the dividend yield  and the expected life of the options 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities measured by enacted tax rates 
we have recorded deferred tax assets for certain state operating loss carryforwards and nondeductible accruals 
we established a valuation allowance related to certain of our state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective state tax jurisdictions 
we had net operating loss carryforwards nols in fiscal years and of approximately million and million  respectively  for state tax purposes and a related valuation allowance against the nols of approximately million at june  no valuation allowance was required for the year ended june  these carryforwards expire at various intervals through as of june   we had million of charitable contribution carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  of which million expires in fiscal year  and million expires in fiscal year the future charitable contribution deduction is limited to of taxable income for each year 
based upon our forecasts  we do not expect that we will have sufficient profits to use all of the charitable contributions before they expire 
therefore  we have a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with the charitable contribution carryforward of million as of june  recent accounting standards for information regarding recently issued accounting standards  refer to note z to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity on january   in conjunction with the sale of our yarn spinning facility in edgefield  south carolina  we entered into a five year supply agreement with parkdale america  llc to supply our yarn requirements 
on june   we amended the agreement to extend its expiration date to december  the amendment also adjusted the conversion costs  waste factors  basis and carry costs 
all other terms in the agreement remained the same 
under the supply agreement  we purchase from parkdale all yarn required by delta apparel and our wholly owned subsidiaries for use in our manufacturing operations excluding yarns that parkdale did not manufacture as of the date of the original agreement in the ordinary course of its business or due to temporary parkdale capacity restraints 
the purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost 
thus  we are subject to the commodity risk of cotton prices and cotton price movements  which could result in unfavorable yarn pricing for us 
we fix the cotton prices as a component of the purchase price of yarn  pursuant to the supply agreement  in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from parkdale 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time we elect to fix specific cotton prices 
yarn with respect to which we have fixed cotton prices at june  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and december at june   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the yarn 
this compares to what would have been a negative impact of million at the fiscal year end based on the yarn with fixed cotton prices at june  the impact of a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have been greater at june  than at june  due to increased commitments at june  compared to june  the impact was partially offset by lower cotton prices at june  than at june  we may use derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in commodity prices 
we do not designate our options as hedge instruments upon inception 
accordingly  we mark to market changes in the fair market value of the options in cost of sales in the statements of income 
we did not own any cotton options contracts on june  or june  interest rate sensitivity our credit agreements provide that the outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding indebtedness at june  under the revolving credit facilities had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness was increased by basis points  our expense would have increased by approximately million  or  for the fiscal year 
this compares to an increase of million  or  for the fiscal year based on the outstanding indebtedness at june  the effect of a basis point increase in interest rates would have had a smaller dollar impact as of june  than as of june  due to the lower debt levels outstanding on june  however  the percentage increase for fiscal year is higher because our total interest expense for fiscal year was lower than our total interest expense for fiscal year the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding 
derivatives on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and interest rate collar agreement to manage our interest rate exposure and effectively reduce the impact of future interest rate changes

any ineffectiveness in our hedging relationships is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of operations
