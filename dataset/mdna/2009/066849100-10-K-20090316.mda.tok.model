the analysis of net interest income tables included in this annual report on form k provide a reconciliation of tax equivalent financial information to the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
management believes the disclosure of tax equivalent net interest income information improves the clarity of financial analysis  and is particularly useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the changes and trends in the company s results of operations 
other financial institutions commonly present net interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
this adjustment is considered helpful in the comparison of one financial institution s net interest income to that of another institution  as each will have a different proportion of tax exempt interest from their earning asset portfolios 
moreover  net interest income is a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions  net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
for purposes of this measure as well  other financial institutions generally use tax equivalent net interest income to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution

business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are in serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
nationwide unemployment has increased significantly 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets served by the bank 
on an overall basis  the business environment was adverse for many households and businesses in the united states and worldwide 
while the weaknesses in the national economy have not yet surfaced in coastal maine to the same extent as in most other parts of the united states  company management assumes that some aspects of the overall economic downturn will continue to affect the economy in its markets as well  causing continued deterioration in the foreseeable future 
such national and local conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the company s loans and securities  results of operations  and financial condition 
company management expects a continued contraction in economic activity throughout and early management anticipates lower demand for business loans in and added pressure on its ability to retain and attract core deposits 
the bank s credit quality has been strong over the past several years and this continued to be the case at december  however  management is cognizant of deteriorating economic conditions overall and declining real estate and loan collateral values in particular 
accordingly  management believes the continuation of strong credit quality will be a significant determinant of the company s future financial performance 
considering the company s strong balance sheet  liquidity position  earnings fundamentals and capitalization  company management believes the company is well positioned to successfully manage its way through the many uncertainties that lie ahead for the banking industry through and beyond 
other factors  which could affect the company s financial performance and that of its common stock  are more fully enumerated in the forward looking statements discussion at the beginning of this annual report on form k and the company s discussion of certain risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this report 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully enumerated in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the reader of the financial statements should review these policies to gain a greater understanding of how the company s financial performance is reported 
management believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses allowance is a significant accounting estimate used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the allowance  which is established through a provision for loan loss expense  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated inherent risk of probable loss in the loan portfolio 
management regularly evaluates the allowance for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of collateral 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
a smaller provision for loan losses results in higher net income  and when a greater amount of provision for loan losses is necessary  the result is lower net income 
refer to part ii  item  allowance for loan losses and provision  in this annual report on form k  for further discussion and analysis concerning the allowance 
other than temporary impairments on securities one of the significant estimates related to investment securities is the evaluation of other than temporary impairments 
the evaluation of securities for other than temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition and or future prospects  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period of unrealized losses 
securities that are in an unrealized loss position  are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an other than temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors and measures 
the primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for securities is other than temporary include a the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost or amortized cost and the expected recovery period of the security  b the financial condition  credit rating and future prospects of the issuer  c whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  d the volatility of the securities market price e the intent and ability of the company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery  which may be at maturity and f any other information and observable data considered relevant in determining whether other than temporary impairment has occurred  including the expectation of receipt of all principal and interest due 
for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows  such as private label mortgage backed securities  the company periodically updates its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
the company s best estimate of cash flows is based upon assumptions consistent with an economic recession  similar to those the company believes market participants would use 
if the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its cost or amortized cost and there has been an adverse change in timing or amount of anticipated future cash flows since the last revised estimate to the extent that the company does not expect to receive of future contractual principal and interest  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized 
the company also considers its intent and ability to retain a temporarily depressed security until recovery  which may be at maturity 
estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral 
in addition  projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral
