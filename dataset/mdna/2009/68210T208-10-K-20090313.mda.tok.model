actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to those discussed under the headings cautionary statements  risk factors  and forward looking statements provided by us pursuant to the safe harbor established by the federal securities laws should be evaluated in the context of these factors 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained herein 
executive overview our business is driven by the supply and demand of hydrocarbon commodities in the united states and  to a certain extent  the international markets 
virtually all of our customers are involved in the exploration and or production of oil and natural gas in the continental united states and the coastal waters of the gulf of mexico 
not surprisingly  a higher demand for oil and gas results in a higher demand for our equipment and services 
our operational levels for were consistent with for the first three quarters of the year but declined during the fourth quarter as the demand for natural gas fell 
in the immediate past  we have been very active in acquiring companies which we believe are well aligned with our company philosophy 
the companies acquired have been complementary to our core business segments 
we plan to diversify into other service lines and other service areas through additional acquisitions  as such opportunities arise that we believe fit into our overall business strategy 
we continue to maintain a large and visible presence along the coast of louisiana to service our customers in the offshore exploration and production markets 
while the offshore rig counts in the gulf of mexico have fallen in recent years and remained stagnant from to  we feel that there is still adequate activity in the area to allow us to remain profitable in that region 
our acquisitions have allowed us to expand our operations into what currently appear to be more prolific areas of activity  such as the rocky mountain and prolific shale regions in the south central united states 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we anticipate that the rocky mountain region will continue to be a very active area in terms of natural gas exploration 
during  we opened an equipment leasing location in rock springs  wyoming to allow us to establish a presence in the rocky mountain region 
in conjunction with the acquisition of holston  we were able to expand our visibility in the rocky mountains with the addition of an additional leasing location in vernal  utah 
the haynesville and fayetteville shale region in northern louisiana and southern arkansas also appear to be a very active area in terms of oil and gas exploration and production 
our acquisition of rig tools in november and industrial lift in april allowed us to position ourselves in some of the more prolific share regions to take advantage of the anticipated growth in those geographical area 
it is our intention to continue to expand into areas that we feel are beneficial to the growth and well being of the company 
general demand for our services 
we receive our revenues from customers in the energy industry 
demand for our seismic services is principally impacted by conditions affecting geophysical companies engaged in the acquisition of d seismic data 
all other services and equipment rentals are a function of exploration and production activities of oil and gas companies operating in the continental united states  as well as  in the gulf of mexico 
the level of demand for our services and equipment rentals is primarily influenced by the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
a number of factors affect the decision of oil and gas companies to pursue the acquisition of seismic data and the exploration for oil and gas  including i prevailing and expected oil and gas demand and prices  ii the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  iii the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  iv the availability and cost of permits and consents from landowners to conduct seismic activity  v local and international political and economic conditions  vi governmental regulations  and vii the availability and cost of capital 
the ability to finance the acquisition of seismic data in the absence of oil and gas companies interest in obtaining the information is also a factor  as some geophysical companies will acquire seismic data on a speculative basis 
the demand for our environmental  equipment rental  transportation and fluid and other services are affected by the level of activity in the exploration and production of oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico  the rocky mountains and the barnett  fayetteville and haynesville shale regions 
seasonality and weather risks 
our seismic services operations are subject to seasonal variations in weather conditions and daylight hours as our activities take place outdoors 
on average  fewer hours are worked per day and fewer holes are generally drilled or surveyed per day in winter months than in summer months due to an increase in rainy  foggy  and cold conditions and a decrease in daylight hours 
our environmental  equipment rental  transportation and fluid and other services are potentially affected by hurricanes in the gulf of mexico region 
the hurricane season is from june through november each year

we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if circumstances indicate our goodwill might be impaired 
our tests for and resulted in no indications of impairment 
however  upon completion of our test in  there were indicators that the a portion of the goodwill and intangibles of our seismic services  equipment leasing and environmental services segments might be impaired 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets we calculated the implied fair value of the goodwill and intangibles for these segments and determined that the implied fair value was less than the carrying value of the goodwill and intangibles  meaning that the goodwill and intangibles were impaired 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million to write off a portion of the intangible and goodwill balances related to our seismic services  equipment leasing and environmental services segments 
management of the company believes that the intangibles and goodwill of these segments were impaired because of the overall economic downturn and deterioration in the global credit markets and specifically the downturn in the oilfield services sector  which has resulted in a decline in the company s stock price and market valuation 
the intangibles and goodwill which were written off arose from our acquisitions of cypress  preheat  rig tools  holston and industrial lift between february and april interest expense decreased approximately million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  increased levels of debt including financing for recent acquisitions were offset by decreases in variable interest rates from to loss on debt extinguishment decreased million from to primarily as a result of the early repayment of our previous revolving line of credit in march in november  as an accommodation to the holder of a former shareholder note  we paid the million due in february in exchange for a discounted payment by million

accordingly  any remaining deferred loan cost attributable to line of credit was expensed at that time in addition to an early payment penalty

preferred stock dividends were million each for the years ended december  and furthermore  we recorded a non cash charge deemed dividend of million attributable to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the series c convertible preferred stock issued in and million issued in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash on hand and approximately million available for future borrowings on our revolving line of credit 
this compares to approximately million in cash on hand and approximately million available for future borrowings on our revolving line of credit at december  because we borrowed the full availability under our revolving line of credit to better illustrate for investors and financial analysts our funds availability at the end of the year 
the amount was repaid on the first business day of january at december   we had working capital of approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  our decrease in working capital is attributable to the increase in the current portion of long term debt as a result of acquisitions in cash provided by continuing operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in and  the largest contributing factor to our increase over the previous year was income from operations 
in  the largest contributing factor to our decrease over the prior year was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
historically  our capital requirements have primarily related to the purchase or fabrication of new seismic drilling equipment  and related support equipment 
as our business has diversified  the capital requirements have expanded to include additions to our equipment rental fleet and expansion of our rolling stock 
in we acquired preheat and rig tools  purchased approximately million in equipment and refinanced our rolling stock of vehicles previously accounted for as capital leases into operating leases 
in  we acquired holston and certain assets of cypress and boi  and purchased approximately million in equipment 
for the year ended december   we completed the acquisitions of beg and industrial lift and expended approximately million on equipment and other fixed assets 
in  we will continue to explore strategic business opportunities and upgrade our equipment to improve efficiency of our operations enabling to us to continue to be responsive to our markets as directed by the needs of our customers 
effective as of april   we completed a modification of our million credit facility senior credit facility  including a million term loan  a million working capital revolving line of credit  and a million delayed draw term loan available to fund future acquisitions 
with the proceeds from the senior credit facility  we i repaid approximately million of outstanding principal balance under our previous term loan  ii repaid approximately million of outstanding principal balance under our previous capital expenditure loan  iii repaid the balance on the previous line of credit  and iv closed the acquisition of industrial lift 
the balance of the proceeds available under the senior credit facility was used to pay fees and expenses of the aforementioned transaction and to provide additional working capital 
on august   the senior credit facility was amended to remove the million delayed draw term loan 
as an accommodation to our lender  we agreed to remove the delayed draw portion of the senior credit facility in order to make syndication of the loan more manageable 
loan closing costs related to our various credit facilities of million were incurred during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents 
index to financial statements we believe that our internally generated cash flow from operations is sufficient to finance the majority of our cash requirements for current and future operations  budgeted capital expenditures and debt service for as we have historically done  we may  from time to time  access available funds under our senior credit facility to supplement our liquidity to meet our cash requirements for day to day operations and times of peak needs throughout the year 
our planned capital expenditures as well as any acquisitions we choose to pursue  are expected to be financed through a combination of cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our senior credit facility contains numerous covenants that govern our ability to make investments and to repurchase our stock 
even if we experience a more severe downturn in our business  we believe that the covenants related to our capital spending and our investments are within our control 
therefore  we believe we can avoid a default of these covenants 
although continued deterioration of market conditions could lead to a downgrade in the credit ratings of companies in our industry  a downgrade of our credit rating would not have an effect on our outstanding debt under our senior credit facility  but would potentially impact our ability to obtain additional external financing  if it was required 
during  management plans to continue to invest in our business through capital expenditures  albeit at levels lower than in prior years 
our capital expenditure program for is expected to total approximately million  of which approximately million had already been committed  as of december  our focus in will be maximizing the utilization of our current equipment  however  we may seek to increase our capital expenditure budget in the event expansion opportunities develop 
we currently plan to fund these expenditures through a combination of cash on hand  operating cash flows and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
should our operating cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund these expenditures  management expects it will adjust capital spending plans accordingly 
while management anticipates that may be a period of lower demand and prices for our services  we believe that our operating cash flow  cash on hand and available borrowings  coupled with our ability to control our capital expenditures  will be sufficient to maintain adequate liquidity throughout we have no plans to sell or liquidate any significant assets currently utilized in our active operating fleet other than the disposal of excess equipment in the normal course of business 
management believes that softening market conditions may have an impact on our customer s payment patterns but we continue to monitor policies currently in place and do not expect any material impact to our liquidity as a result 
management anticipates that the senior credit facility should be adequate to support the operating needs of the company during these uncertain economic times and further feels that it will be able to maintain compliance with the required covenants of our senior credit facility 
if for some reason the senior credit facility were to become unavailable  the company may not be able to operate as a going concern

critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements accounts receivable we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review outstanding receivables  and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  we make judgments regarding the customer s ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful account may be required 
due to the nature of our industry  we may periodically have concentration of credit risks 
as a result  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be significant 
inventory we have made significant investments in inventory to service our equipment 
on a routine basis  we use judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of average cost or market 
technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products primarily influence our estimates 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations change  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
in making this determination  we have considered future taxable income in assessing the ultimate recoverability of the recognized net deferred tax asset 
other contingencies we record liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  we obtain indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments to recorded amounts may be required 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and  to a limited extent  self funded insurance programs 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no

the cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no

 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
if the carrying amount of the asset  including any intangible assets associated with that asset  exceeds its estimated undiscounted net cash flow  before interest  we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between its carrying amount and its estimated fair value 
assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their net book value or their net realizable value  which is determined based upon an estimate of their fair market value less the cost of selling the assets
