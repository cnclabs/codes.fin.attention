banner bank is a regional bank which offers a wide variety of commercial banking services and financial products to individuals  businesses and public sector entities in its primary market areas 
islanders bank is a community bank which offers similar banking services to individuals  businesses and public entities located in the san juan islands 
our primary business is that of traditional financial institutions  accepting deposits and originating loans in locations surrounding our offices in portions of washington  oregon and idaho 
banner bank is also an active participant in the secondary market  engaging in mortgage banking operations largely through the origination and sale of one to four family residential loans 
lending activities include commercial business and commercial real estate loans  agriculture business loans  construction and land development loans  one to four family residential loans and consumer loans 
a portion of banner bank s construction and mortgage lending activities are conducted through its subsidiary  community financial corporation cfc  which is located in the lake oswego area of portland  oregon 
as discussed more thoroughly in later sections of this report  increased delinquencies and defaults in the residential construction and land development portions of our loan portfolio had a materially adverse effect on our results of operations for the year ended december  while it is difficult to predict when and how the weak housing markets that caused this increase in delinquencies and defaults will improve  we anticipate that an elevated level of non performing assets will persist for a number of quarters and will have a continuing adverse effect on our earnings during and possibly continuing into over the past several years  we have invested significantly in expanding our branch and distributions systems with a primary emphasis on expanding our presence in the four largest areas of commerce in the northwest the puget sound region of washington and the greater boise  idaho  portland  oregon  and spokane  washington markets 
as a result of our aggressive franchise expansion  we have added new branches through acquisition  opened new branches and relocated eight others in the last four years 
in  we completed the acquisitions of three smaller commercial banks in the state of washington 
these acquisitions increased our presence within desirable marketplaces and allow us to better serve existing and future customers 
our branch expansion has been a significant element in our strategy to grow loans  deposits and customer relationships 
this emphasis on growth has resulted in an elevated level of operating expenses  however  we believe that over time these new branches should help improve profitability by providing lower cost core deposits which will allow us to proportionately reduce higher cost borrowings as a source of funds 
we now have reached our goal in terms of the number of branches required to generate deposit growth sufficient to fund our expected loan growth and produce significant fee generating opportunities 
as a result  during we opened just two new branches and we plan to open only three additional branches in  a normal level of growth for a bank of our size 
recent developments participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program on november   we received million from the us treasury department as part of the treasury s capital purchase program 
we issued million in senior preferred stock  with a related warrant to purchase up to million in common stock  to the us treasury 
the warrant provides the treasury the option to purchase up to  shares of banner corporation common stock at a price of per share at any time during the next ten years 
the preferred stock will pay a dividend for the first five years  after which the rate will increase to if the preferred shares are not redeemed by the company 
the terms and conditions of the transaction and the preferred stock conform to those provided by the us treasury 
a summary of the capital purchase program can be found on the treasury s web site at www

gov initiatives eesa 
the additional capital will enhance our capacity to support the communities we serve through expanded lending activities and economic development 
this capital will also add flexibility in considering strategic opportunities that may be available to us as the financial services industry continues to consolidate 
goodwill write off as a result of the significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization over the course of and in conjunction with similar declines in the value of most financial institutions and the ongoing disruption in related financial markets  we decided to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in our consolidated statements of financial condition by recording a million write down in the second quarter and  in response to worsening economic indicators and further price declines  an additional million write down in the fourth quarter of the total million write off of goodwill was a non cash charge that did not affect the company s or the banks liquidity or operations 
the adjustment brought our book value and tangible book value more closely in line with each other and more accurately reflected current market conditions 
also  since goodwill is excluded from regulatory capital  the impairment charge which was not deductible for tax purposes did not have an adverse effect on the regulatory capital ratios of the company or either of our subsidiary banks  each of which continues to remain well capitalized under the regulatory requirements 
see note of the selected notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to our valuation of intangible assets 
fannie mae and freddie mac stock valuation in september  the united states treasury announced a plan to place the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac into conservatorship under the authority of the federal housing finance agency 
as of june   banner corporation owned both common and preferred equity securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac with a combined book value of million 
at december   the fair value of these securities had declined to approximately  with the decrease in the value included in the net fair value adjustments detailed in note  fair value accounting and measurement 
the events that led to the significant valuation adjustment for the fannie mae and freddie mac stock were disappointing and we do not anticipate a meaningful recovery with respect to the valuation of that stock 
acquisition of f m bank  san juan financial holding company and ncw community bank we completed the acquisitions of f m bank f m and san juan financial holding company sjfhc effective may   and ncw community bank ncw effective october  sjfhc was merged into banner corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  islanders bank  has continued operations as a subsidiary of banner corporation 
f m and ncw were merged into banner bank upon acquisition and now operate under the banner bank name 
the financial results for the year to date ended december  include assets  liabilities and results of operations for all three of the acquired companies 
the financial results for the year to date ended december  include the assets and liabilities acquired in the f m and sjfhc transactions as well as the impact of those two acquisitions subsequent to may  as reported in the results of operations 
the purchase of f m allowed us to immediately expand banner bank s franchise in the spokane  washington area  the fourth largest metropolitan market in the pacific northwest  by the addition of branches and one loan office 
the acquisition of islanders bank  with its three branches located in the san juan islands  added to our presence in the north puget sound region 
ncw operated one branch in wenatchee  washington and had another branch under construction in east wenatchee 
the ncw merger added to our customer base and market share in the north central washington area and allowed for the consolidation of the two banks branch locations and staffs 
see notes and of selected notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to these acquisitions 
recently adopted accounting standards in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements 
eitf implemented a change in accounting principle that required the recognition of a liability and related compensation costs for endorsement split dollar life insurance policies that provide a benefit to an employee that extends to post retirement periods 
on january   the company adopted eitf and recognized the effects of this change in accounting principle through a  cumulative effect adjustment charge to opening retained earnings and an increase in benefit plan reserve liability of the same amount 
the company recorded an expense of  in from the adoption of eitf lending activities general all of our lending activities are conducted through banner bank  its subsidiary  community financial corporation  and islanders bank 
we offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers 
we originate loans for our own loan portfolio and for sale in the secondary market 
management s strategy has been to maintain a well diversified portfolio with a significant percentage of assets in the loan portfolio having more frequent interest rate repricing terms or shorter maturities than traditional long term fixed rate mortgage loans 
as part of this effort  we have developed a variety of floating or adjustable interest rate products that correlate more closely with our cost of funds  particularly loans for commercial business and real estate  agricultural business  and construction and development purposes 
however  in response to customer demand  we continue to originate fixed rate loans  including fixed interest rate mortgage loans with terms of up to years 
the relative amount of fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment 
while we offer a wide range of loan products  we do not now and have not previously engaged in any sub prime lending programs  nor do we hold any option payment or negatively amortizing loan products in our portfolio 
historically  our lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
real estate lending activities have been significantly focused on residential construction and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties 
in response to strong housing markets  construction and land loan growth was significant for several years  up until the second half of when housing markets began to weaken and the origination of new construction and land loans began to slow appreciably 
as market conditions continued to deteriorate throughout  we have had a significant increase in non performing loans and  as a result  an increase in our loan loss provision with regard most notably to construction and land loans 
at december   construction and land loans represent slightly over one fourth of our loan portfolio 
our lending activities have also included the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
commercial business lending has been directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agri business borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
we have also recently increased our emphasis on consumer lending  although the portion of the loan portfolio invested in consumer loans is still relatively small 
while continuing our commitment to residential lending  we expect commercial lending including commercial real estate  commercial business and agricultural lending and consumer lending to become increasingly important activities for us 
by contrast  we anticipate residential construction and land development lending will be restrained by market conditions for the next two to three years and construction and land loans will become a proportionately smaller amount of our loan portfolio over time 
at december   our net loan portfolio totaled billion 
for additional information concerning our loan portfolio  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and loans lending 
see also table contained therein  which sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio  and tables and a  which contain information regarding the loans maturing in our portfolio 
one to four family residential real estate lending at both banner bank and islanders bank  we originate loans secured by first mortgages on one to four family residences in the northwest communities where we have offices 
banner bank s mortgage lending subsidiary  cfc  provides residential lending primarily in the greater portland  oregon and pasco tri cities  washington market areas 
as noted above  we have not engaged in any sub prime lending  which we define as loans to borrowers with poor credit histories or undocumented repayment capabilities and with excessive reliance on the collateral as the source of repayment  however  we have experienced a modest increase in delinquencies on our residential loans in response to the weakened housing market conditions 
at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we offer fixed and adjustable rate mortgages arms at rates and terms competitive with market conditions  primarily with the intent of selling these loans into the secondary market 
fixed rate loans generally are offered on a fully amortizing basis for terms ranging from to years at interest rates and fees that reflect current secondary market pricing 
most arm products offered adjust annually after an initial period ranging from one to five years  subject to a limitation on the annual change of to and a lifetime limitation of to 
for a small portion of the portfolio  where the initial period exceeds one year  the first rate change may exceed the annual limitation on subsequent rate changes 
our arm products most frequently adjust based upon the average yield on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year plus a margin or spread above the index 
arm loans held in our portfolio may allow for interest only payments for an initial period up to five years but do not provide for negative amortization of principal and carry no prepayment restrictions 
the retention of arm loans in our loan portfolio can help reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  borrower demand for arm loans versus fixed rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates  the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan 
in recent years  borrower demand for arm loans has been limited and we have chosen not to aggressively pursue arm loans by offering minimally profitable  deeply discounted teaser rates or option payment arm products 
as a result  arm loans have represented only a small portion of our loans originated during this period and of our portfolio 
our residential loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or fhlmc and the federal national mortgage corporation fannie mae or fnma 
government insured loans are underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the department of housing and urban development hud and the veterans administration va 
in the loan approval process  we assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan  the adequacy of the proposed security  the employment stability of the borrower and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
for arm loans  our standard practice provides for underwriting based upon fully indexed interest rates and payments 
generally  we will lend up to of the lesser of the appraised value of the property or purchase price of the property on conventional loans  although higher loan to value ratios are available on certain government insured programs 
we require private mortgage insurance on residential loans with a loan to value ratio at origination exceeding 
a growing but immaterial number of exceptions to these general underwriting guidelines have been granted in connection with the sale or refinance of properties  particularly new construction  for which we were already providing financing 
these exceptions most commonly relate to loan to value and mortgage insurance requirements and not to credit underwriting or loan documentation standards 
such exceptions will likely increase in the near term to facilitate troubled loan resolution in the current distressed housing market  but likely will not have a material effect on the performance characteristics of our one to four family loan portfolio or become a significant portion of our total loan portfolio 
through our mortgage banking activities  we sell residential loans on either a servicing retained or servicing released basis 
the decision to hold or sell loans is based on asset liability management goals and policies and market conditions 
during the past three years  we have sold a significant portion of our conventional residential mortgage originations and nearly all of our government insured loans into the secondary market 
construction and land lending we have invested a significant portion of our loan portfolio in residential construction and land loans to professional home builders and developers 
to a lesser extent  we also originate construction loans for commercial and multifamily real estate 
in years prior to  residential construction and land development lending was an area of major emphasis at banner bank and the primary focus of its subsidiary  cfc 
our largest concentration of construction and land development loans is in the portland vancouver market area 
we also have a significant amount of construction and land loans for properties in the puget sound region and to a much smaller extent in the greater boise area and certain eastern washington and eastern oregon markets 
at december   construction and land loans totaled billion  or of total loans of the company  consisting of million of one to four family construction loans  million of land or land development loans and million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans 
historically  construction and land lending has afforded us the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than are usually available on other types of lending 
construction and land lending  however  involve a higher degree of risk than other lending opportunities because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
disagreements between borrowers and builders and the failure of builders to pay subcontractors may also jeopardize projects 
loans to builders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan is dependent on the builder s ability to sell the property before the construction loan is due 
we address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies  disbursement procedures and monitoring practices 
construction loans made by us include those with a sale contract or permanent loan in place for the finished homes and those for which purchasers for the finished homes may be identified either during or following the construction period 
we actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations 
the maximum number of speculative loans approved for each builder is based on a combination of factors  including the financial capacity of the builder  the market demand for the finished product and the ratio of sold to unsold inventory the builder maintains 
we have attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with a large number of small and mid sized builders spread over a relatively large geographic area with numerous sub markets 
loans for the construction of one to four family residences are generally made for a term of twelve to eighteen months 
our loan policies include maximum loan to value ratios of up to for speculative loans 
individual speculative loan requests are supported by an independent appraisal of the property  a set of plans  a cost breakdown and a completed specifications form 
underwriting is focused on the borrowers financial strength  credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations 
all speculative construction loans must be approved by senior loan officers 
we also make land loans to developers  builders and individuals to finance the acquisition and or development of improved lots or unimproved land 
in making land loans  we follow underwriting policies and disbursement and monitoring procedures similar to those for construction loans 
the initial term on land loans is typically one to three years with interest only payments  payable monthly  and provisions for principal reduction as lots are sold and released from the lien of the mortgage 
we regularly monitor the construction and land loan portfolios and the economic conditions and housing inventory in each of our markets and decrease this type of lending if we perceive unfavorable market conditions 
unfortunately  housing markets in most areas of the pacific northwest have significantly deteriorated over the past twelve to eighteen months and our origination of new construction loans has declined sharply 
we believe that the underwriting policies and internal monitoring systems we have in place mitigate many of the risks inherent in construction and land lending  however  current weak housing market conditions have resulted in a material increase of delinquencies in our construction and land loan portfolios 
while construction and land loans represent of our portfolio and are responsible for approximately of our non performing assets  they are well diversified with respect to sub markets  price ranges and borrowers  however  they are significantly concentrated in the greater puget sound region of washington state and the portland  oregon market area 
reducing the amount of non performing construction and land development loans is currently the most critical issue that we face and need to resolve to return to acceptable levels of profitability 
the most significant risk in this portfolio relates to the land development loans as demand for building lots is currently weak 
see asset quality below and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset quality 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate including  as noted above  loans for construction of multifamily and commercial real estate projects 
commercial real estate loans are made for both owner occupied and investor properties 
at december   our loan portfolio included million in multifamily and billion in commercial real estate loans which together comprised of our total loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate lending affords us an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those generally available from one to four family residential lending 
however  loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are generally greater in amount  more difficult to evaluate and monitor and  therefore  riskier than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
in originating multifamily and commercial real estate loans  we consider the location  marketability and overall attractiveness of the properties 
our current underwriting guidelines for multifamily and commercial real estate loans require an appraisal from a qualified independent appraiser and an economic analysis of each property with regard to the annual revenue and expenses  debt service coverage and fair value to determine the maximum loan amount 
in the approval process we assess the borrowers willingness and ability to manage the property and repay the loan and the adequacy of the collateral in relation to the loan amount 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
most multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated in the past five years are linked to various us treasury indices  federal home loan bank advance rates  certain prime rates or other market rate indices 
rates on these adjustable rate loans generally adjust with a frequency of one to five years after an initial fixed rate period ranging from one to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no large concentrations by property type  location or borrower 
commercial business lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending and are engaged to a lesser extent in agricultural lending primarily by providing crop production loans 
our officers devote a great deal of effort to developing customer relationships and the ability to serve these types of borrowers 
management believes that many larger banks have neglected these lending markets  which has contributed to our success 
while strengthening our commitment to small business lending  in recent years we have added experienced officers and staff focused on corporate lending opportunities for borrowers with credit needs generally in a million to million range 
management has leveraged the past success of these officers with local decision making ability to continue to expand this market niche 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped us increase our deposit base 
expanding commercial lending and related commercial banking services is currently an area of significant focus by us and staffing has been increased in the areas of credit administration  business development  and loan and deposit operations 
commercial business loans may entail greater risk than other types of loans 
commercial business loans may be unsecured or secured by special purpose or rapidly depreciating assets  such as equipment  inventory and receivables  which may not provide an adequate source of repayment on defaulted loans 
in addition  commercial business loans are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial strength and management ability  as well as market conditions for various products  services and commodities 
for these reasons  commercial business loans generally provide higher yields than many other types of loans but also require more administrative and management attention 
loan terms  including the fixed or adjustable interest rate  the loan maturity and the collateral considerations  vary significantly and are negotiated on an individual loan basis 
we underwrite our commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower s cash flow and ability to service the debt from earnings rather than on the basis of the underlying collateral value 
we seek to structure these loans so that they have more than one source of repayment 
the borrower is required to provide us with sufficient information to allow us to make a lending determination 
in most instances  this information consists of at least three years of financial statements  tax returns  a statement of projected cash flows  current financial information on any guarantor and information about the collateral 
loans to closely held businesses typically require personal guarantees by the principals 
our commercial loan portfolio is geographically dispersed across the market areas serviced by our branch network and there are no significant concentrations by industry or products 
our commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit 
commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of fixed assets and have maturities of five years or less 
commercial business lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are usually approved with a term of one year 
adjustable or floating rate loans are primarily tied to various prime rate and london inter bank offering rate or libor indices 
at december   commercial loans totaled million  or of our total loans 
agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many parts of our service areas 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we intend to continue to make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operations of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile 
at december   agricultural business loans  including collateral secured loans to purchase farm land and equipment  totaled million  or of our loan portfolio 
agricultural operating loans generally are made as a percentage of the borrower s anticipated income to support budgeted operating expenses 
these loans are secured by a blanket lien on all crops  livestock  equipment  accounts and products and proceeds thereof 
in the case of crops  consideration is given to projected yields and prices from each commodity 
the interest rate is normally floating based on the prime rate plus a negotiated margin 
because these loans are made to finance a farm or ranch s annual operations  they are written on a one year review and renewable basis 
the renewal is dependent upon the prior year s performance and the forthcoming year s projections as well as the overall financial strength of the borrower 
we carefully monitor these loans and related variance reports on income and expenses compared to budget estimates 
to meet the seasonal operating needs of a farm  borrowers may qualify for single payment notes  revolving lines of credit and or non revolving lines of credit 
in underwriting agricultural operating loans  we consider the cash flow of the borrower based upon the expected operating results as well as the value of collateral used to secure the loans 
collateral generally consists of cash crops produced by the farm  such as milk  grains  fruit  grass seed  peas  sugar beets  mint  onions  potatoes  corn and alfalfa or livestock 
in addition to considering cash flow and obtaining a blanket security interest in the farm s cash crop  we may also collateralize an operating loan with the farm s operating equipment  breeding stock  real estate and federal agricultural program payments to the borrower 
we also originate loans to finance the purchase of farm equipment 
loans to purchase farm equipment are made for terms of up to seven years 
on occasion  we also originate agricultural real estate loans secured primarily by first liens on farmland and improvements thereon located in our market areas  although generally only to service the needs of our existing customers 
loans are written in amounts ranging from to of the tax assessed or appraised value of the property for terms of five to years 
these loans generally have interest rates that adjust at least every five years based upon a us treasury index or federal home loan bank advance rate plus a negotiated margin 
fixed rate loans are granted on terms usually not to exceed five years 
in originating agricultural real estate loans  we consider the debt service coverage of the borrower s cash flow  the appraised value of the underlying property  the experience and knowledge of the borrower  and the borrower s past performance with us and or the market area 
these loans normally are not made to start up businesses and are reserved for existing customers with substantial equity and a proven history 
among the more common risks to agricultural lending can be weather conditions and disease 
these risks may be mitigated through multi peril crop insurance 
commodity prices also present a risk  which may be reduced by the use of set price contracts 
normally  required beginning and projected operating margins provide for reasonable reserves to offset unexpected yield and price deficiencies 
in addition to these risks  we also consider management succession  life insurance and business continuation plans when evaluating agricultural loans 
consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile loans and loans secured by deposit accounts 
while consumer lending has traditionally been a small part of our business  with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base  it has received renewed emphasis in recent years and management anticipates increased activity in future periods 
part of this emphasis has been the reintroduction of a banner bank funded credit card program which we began marketing in the fourth quarter of similar to other consumer loan programs  we focus this credit card program on our existing customer base to add to the depth of our customer relationships 
as a result of increased marketing efforts  an improved retail delivery network and strong borrower demand  as well as the three bank acquisitions  our consumer loans increased significantly in the past two years 
our underwriting of consumer loans is focused on the borrower s credit history and ability to repay the debt as evidenced by documented sources of income 
at december   we had million  or of our loans receivable  in consumer related loans  an increase of million or from december  similar to commercial loans  consumer loans often entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer loan borrower against an assignee of such loans such as us  and a borrower may be able to assert against the assignee claims and defenses that it has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
loan solicitation and processing we originate real estate loans in our market areas by direct solicitation of real estate brokers  builders  depositors  walk in customers and visitors to our internet website 
loan applications are taken by our loan officers and are processed in branch or regional locations 
most underwriting and loan administration functions for our real estate loans are performed by loan personnel at central locations 
we do not make loans originated by independent third party loan brokers or any similar wholesale loan origination channels 
our commercial loan officers solicit commercial and agricultural business loans through call programs focused on local businesses and farmers 
while commercial loan officers are delegated reasonable commitment authority based upon their qualifications  credit decisions on significant commercial and agricultural loans are made by senior loan officers or in certain instances by the board of directors of banner bank  islanders bank or banner corporation 
we originate consumer loans through various marketing efforts directed primarily toward our existing deposit and loan customers 
consumer loan applications may be processed at branch locations or by administrative personnel at our main office 
loan originations  sales and purchases while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
for the years ended december   and  we originated loans  net of repayments  of million  million and million  respectively 
the decline in originations  net of repayments  in the two most recent years is primarily the result of a decrease in the origination of new construction and land loans in response to slower new home sales 
in recent years  we have sold most of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans and a portion of our sba guaranteed loans to secondary market purchasers as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
sales of loans generally are beneficial to us because these sales may generate income at the time of sale  provide funds for additional lending and other investments  increase liquidity or reduce interest rate risk 
we sell loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
all loans are sold without recourse 
see loan servicing 
at december   we had million in loans held for sale 
we periodically purchase whole loans and loan participation interests primarily during periods of reduced loan demand in our primary market area and at times to support our community reinvestment act lending activities 
any such purchases are made consistent with our underwriting standards  however  the loans may be located outside of our normal lending area 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
loan servicing we receive fees from a variety of institutional owners in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual payments and managing portfolios of sold loans 
at december   we were servicing million of loans for others 
loan servicing includes processing payments  accounting for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes  hazard insurance and other loan related items such as private mortgage insurance 
in addition to earning fee income  we retain certain amounts in escrow for the benefit of the lender for which we incur no interest expense but are able to invest the funds into earning assets 
at december   we held million in escrow for our portfolio of loans serviced for others 
the loan servicing portfolio at december  was composed of million of freddie mac residential mortgage loans  million of fannie mae residential mortgage loans and million of both residential and non residential mortgage loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington and oregon 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of loan servicing fees  net of  of servicing rights amortization  in our results of operations 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the cost of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  and million  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
no msrs were purchased in those periods 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
msrs generally are adversely affected by higher levels of current or anticipated prepayments resulting from decreasing interest rates 
at december   msrs were carried at a value of million  net of amortization 
asset quality classified assets state and federal regulations require that the banks review and classify their problem assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  state and federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
banner bank s credit policy division reviews detailed information with respect to the composition and performance of the loan portfolios  including information on risk concentrations  delinquencies and classified assets for both banner bank and islanders bank 
the credit policy division approves all recommendations for new classified assets or changes in classifications  and develops and monitors action plans to resolve the problems associated with the assets 
the credit policy division also approves recommendations for establishing the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
significant problem loans are transferred to banner bank s special assets department for resolution or collection activities 
the banks and banner corporation s boards of directors are given a detailed report on classified assets and asset quality at least quarterly 
for additional information with respect to asset quality and non performing loans  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and asset quality  and table contained therein 
allowance for loan losses in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent with the generally acceptable accounting principles gaap guidelines 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible loan losses against our income 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million  which represented of net loans and of non performing loans compared to and  respectively  at december  for additional information concerning our allowance for loan losses  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and provision and allowance for loan losses  and tables and contained therein 
investment activities under washington state law  banks are permitted to invest in various types of marketable securities 
authorized securities include but are not limited to us treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies including government sponsored enterprises  mortgage backed securities  certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions  bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements  federal funds  commercial paper  corporate debt and equity securities and obligations of states and their political subdivisions 
our investment policies are designed to provide and maintain adequate liquidity and to generate favorable rates of return without incurring undue interest rate or credit risk 
our policies generally limit investments to us government and government agency including government sponsored entities securities  municipal bonds  certificates of deposit  marketable corporate debt obligations and mortgage backed securities 
investment in mortgage backed securities may include those issued or guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae  government national mortgage association ginnie mae or gnma and privately issued mortgage backed securities that have an aa credit rating or higher  as well as collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
a high credit rating indicates only that the rating agency believes there is a low risk of loss or default 
to the best of our knowledge  we do not have any investments in mortgage backed securities  collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles that have a material exposure to sub prime mortgages 
however  we do have investments in single issuer and pooled trust preferred securities that have been materially adversely impacted by concerns related to the banking and insurance industries 
further  all of our investment securities  including those that have high credit ratings  are subject to market risk in so far as a change in market rates of interest or other conditions may cause a change in an investment s earning performance and or market value 
at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  municipal bonds and corporate debt obligations 
from time to time  investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives  and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in loan originations  deposits and other activities 
during the year ended december   holdings of mortgage backed securities increased million to million  us treasury and agency obligations increased million to million  corporate securities including equities decreased million largely as a result of fair value adjustments to million  and municipal bonds increased million to million 
for detailed information on our investment securities  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and investments  and tables to contained therein 
off balance sheet derivatives derivatives include off balance sheet financial products whose value is dependent on the value of an underlying financial asset  such as a stock  bond  foreign currency  or a reference rate or index 
such derivatives include forwards  futures  options or swaps 
we generally have not invested in off balance sheet derivative instruments  although investment policies authorize such investments 
however  through our acquisition of f m we became a party to approximately million million as of december  in notional amounts of interest rate swaps 
these swaps serve as hedges to an equal amount of fixed rate loans which include market value prepayment penalties that mirror the provision of the specifically matched interest rate swaps 
the fair value adjustments for these swaps and the related loans are reflected in other assets or other liabilities as appropriate  and in the carrying value of the hedged loans 
also  as a part of mortgage banking activities  we issue rate lock commitments to borrowers and obtain offsetting best efforts delivery commitments from purchasers of loans 
while not providing any trading or net settlement mechanisms  these off balance sheet commitments do have many of the prescribed characteristics of derivatives and as a result are accounted for as such in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended 
accordingly  on december   we recorded an asset of  and a liability of  representing the estimated market value of those commitments 
on december   we had no other investment related off balance sheet derivatives 
deposit activities and other sources of funds general deposits  fhlb advances or other borrowings and loan repayments are our major sources of funds for lending and other investment purposes 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced by general economic  interest rate and money market conditions and may vary significantly 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes  including funding loans and investments 
we compete with other financial institutions and financial intermediaries in attracting deposits 
there is strong competition for transaction balances and savings deposits from commercial banks  credit unions and nonbank corporations  such as securities brokerage companies  mutual funds and other diversified companies  some of which have nationwide networks of offices 
much of the focus of our recent branch expansion  relocations and renovation has been directed toward attracting additional deposit customer relationships and balances 
in addition  our electronic banking activities including debit card and automated teller machine atm programs  online internet banking services and  most recently  customer remote deposit and mobile banking capabilities are all directed at providing products and services that enhance customer relationships and result in growing deposit balances 
growing deposits is a fundamental element of our core business strategy 
deposit accounts we generally attract deposits from within our primary market areas by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand checking accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market deposit accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit  cash management services and retirement savings plans 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
in determining the terms of deposit accounts  we consider current market interest rates  profitability to us  matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns 
at december   we had billion of deposits  including billion of transaction and savings accounts and billion in time deposits 
for additional information concerning our deposit accounts  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and deposit accounts 
see also table contained therein  which sets forth the balances of deposits in the various types of accounts  and table  which sets forth the amount of our certificates of deposit greater than  by time remaining until maturity as of december  borrowings while deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we also use borrowings to supplement our supply of lendable funds  to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to more efficiently leverage our capital position 
the fhlb seattle serves as our primary borrowing source 
the fhlb seattle provides credit for member financial institutions such as banner bank and islanders bank 
as members  the banks are required to own capital stock in the fhlb seattle and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain of their mortgage loans and securities provided certain credit worthiness standards have been met 
limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit 
at december   we had million of borrowings from the fhlb seattle 
at that date  banner bank had been authorized by the fhlb seattle to borrow up to million under a blanket floating lien security agreement  while islanders bank was approved to borrow up to million under a similar agreement 
more recently  the federal reserve bank of san francisco frbsf has also served as an important source of borrowings 
the frbsf provides credit based upon acceptable loan collateral  which includes certain loan types not eligible for pledging to the fhlb seattle 
at december   based upon our available unencumbered collateral  banner bank was eligible to borrow million from the frbsf  although at that date we had no funds borrowed under this arrangement 
although eligible to participate  islanders bank has not applied for approval to borrow from the frbsf 
at december   there was no outstanding balance on these commercial banking credit lines 
for additional information concerning our borrowings  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and borrowings  table contained therein  and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we issue retail repurchase agreements  generally due within days  as an additional source of funds  primarily in connection with cash management services provided to our larger deposit customers 
at december   we had issued retail repurchase agreements totaling million  which were secured by a pledge of certain mortgage backed securities with a market value of million 
we also may borrow funds through the use of secured wholesale repurchase agreements with securities brokers 
however  we did not have any wholesale repurchase borrowings at december  in addition to our borrowings  we have also issued million of junior subordinated debentures in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities tps 
the tps were issued from through by special purpose business trusts formed by banner corporation and were sold in private offerings to pooled investment vehicles 
the junior subordinated debentures associated with the tps have been recorded as liabilities and are reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial condition  however  at december   all of the fair value of the debentures qualifies as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
we have invested a significant portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the tps as additional paid in capital at banner bank 
for additional information about deposits and other sources of funds  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  and notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item personnel as of december   we had  full time and part time employees 
banner corporation has no employees except for those who are also employees of banner bank  its subsidiaries  and islanders bank 
the employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
taxation federal taxation general for tax reporting purposes  we report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting on a consolidated basis 
we are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including particularly the reserve for bad debts discussed below 
the following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for additional information concerning the income taxes payable by us 
provisions of the small business job protection act of the job protection act significantly altered our tax bad debt deduction method and the circumstances that would require a tax bad debt reserve recapture 
prior to enactment of the job protection act  savings institutions banner bank was previously chartered as a savings institution were permitted to compute their tax bad debt deduction through use of either the reserve method or the percentage of taxable income method 
the job protection act repealed both of these methods for large savings institutions and allows bad debt deductions based only on actual current losses 
while repealing the reserve method for computing tax bad debt deductions  the job protection act allowed savings institutions to retain their existing base year bad debt reserves but required that reserves in excess of the balance at december   be recaptured into taxable income over six years 
the reserves in excess of the base year december  had been fully recaptured into taxable income as of december  the base year reserve is recaptured into taxable income only in limited situations  such as in the event of certain excess distributions  complete liquidation or disqualification as a bank 
none of the limited circumstances requiring recapture are contemplated by us 
the amount of our tax bad debt reserves subject to recapture in these circumstances was approximately million at december  as a result of the remote nature of events that may trigger the recapture provisions  no tax liability has been established in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
state taxation washington taxation we are subject to a business and occupation b o tax which is imposed under washington law at the rate of of gross receipts  however  interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties  residential mortgage backed securities  and certain us government and agency securities is not subject to such tax 
our b o tax expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
oregon and idaho taxation corporations with nexus in the states of oregon and idaho are subject to a corporate level income tax 
our operations in those states resulted in corporate income taxes of approximately   and  net of federal tax benefit for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as our operations in these states increase  the state income tax provision will have an increasing effect on our effective tax rate and results of operations 
competition we encounter significant competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans 
our most direct competition for deposits comes from other commercial and savings banks  savings associations and credit unions with offices in our market areas 
we also experience competition from securities firms  insurance companies  money market and mutual funds  and other investment vehicles 
we expect continued strong competition from such financial institutions and investment vehicles in the foreseeable future  including increasing competition from on line internet banking competitors 
our ability to attract and retain deposits depends on our ability to provide transaction services and investment opportunities that satisfy the requirements of depositors 
we compete for deposits by offering a variety of accounts and financial services  including robust electronic banking capabilities  with competitive rates and terms  at convenient locations and business hours  and delivered with a high level of personal service and expertise 
competition for loans comes principally from other commercial banks  loan brokers  mortgage banking companies  savings banks and credit unions 
the competition for loans is intense as a result of the large number of institutions competing in our market areas 
we compete for loans primarily by offering competitive rates and fees and providing timely decisions and excellent service to borrowers 
regulation banner bank and islanders bank general as state chartered  federally insured commercial banks  banner bank and islanders bank the banks are subject to extensive regulation and must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements  including prescribed minimum capital standards 
the banks are regularly examined by the fdic and state banking regulators and file periodic reports concerning their activities and financial condition with the regulators 
the banks relationship with depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state law  especially in such matters as the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of mortgage and other loan documents 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operation of the banks  including reserves  loans  investments  deposits  capital  issuance of securities  payment of dividends and establishment of branches 
federal and state bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks and bank holding companies if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice 
the respective primary federal regulators of banner corporation  banner bank and islanders bank have authority to impose penalties  initiate civil and administrative actions and take other steps intended to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices 
state regulation and supervision as a washington state chartered commercial bank with branches in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  banner bank is subject to the applicable provisions of washington  oregon and idaho law and regulations 
state law and regulations govern banner bank s ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon  to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate  to make consumer loans  to invest in securities  to offer various banking services to its customers and to establish branch offices 
in a similar fashion  washington state laws and regulations apply to islanders bank 
deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits  up to applicable limits  of depository institutions 
as insurer of the banks deposits  the fdic has supervisory and enforcement authority over banner bank and islanders bank 
the deposits of the banks are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund  or dif  which is administered by the fdic 
the fdic insures deposits up to the applicable limits and this insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
as insurer  the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by institutions insured by the fdic 
it also may prohibit any institution insured by the fdic from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the institution 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition 
the fdic assesses deposit insurance premiums on all fdic insured institutions quarterly based on annualized rates for four risk categories 
each institution is assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital  supervisory ratings and other factors 
well capitalized institutions that are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses are assigned to risk category i 
risk categories ii  iii and iv present progressively greater risks to the dif 
under the fdic s risk based assessment rules  effective april   the initial base assessment rates prior to adjustments range from to basis points for risk category i  and are basis points for risk category ii  basis points for risk category iii  and basis points for risk category iv 
initial base assessment rates are subject to adjustments based on an institution s unsecured debt  secured liabilities and brokered deposits  such that the total base assessment rates after adjustments range from to basis points for risk category i  to basis points for risk category ii  to basis points for risk category iii  and to basis points for risk category iv 
the rule also includes authority for the fdic to increase or decrease total base assessment rates in the future by as much as three basis points without a formal rulemaking proceeding 
in addition to the regular quarterly assessments  due to losses and projected losses attributed to failed institutions  the fdic has adopted a rule  effective april   imposing on every insured institution a special assessment equal to basis points of its assessment base as of june   to be collected on september  there is a proposal under discussion  under which the fdic s line of credit with the us treasury would be increased and the fdic would reduce the special assessment to basis points 
there can be no assurance whether the proposal will become effective 
the special assessment rule also authorizes the fdic to impose additional special assessments if the reserve ratio of the dif is estimated to fall to a level that the fdic s board believes would adversely affect public confidence or that is close to zero or negative 
any additional special assessment would be in an amount up to basis points on the assessment base for the quarter in which it is imposed and would be collected at the end of the following quarter 
insured institutions are required to pay a financing corporation assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the s 
for the year ended december   the financing corporation assessment ranged between and basis points of average domestic deposits 
these assessments  which may be revised based upon the level of dif deposits  will continue until the bonds mature in the years through for  the banks incurred  in fico assessments 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the fdic 
it also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital 
if insurance of accounts is terminated  the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination  less subsequent withdrawals  shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years  as determined by the fdic 
management is aware of no existing circumstances which would result in termination of the deposit insurance of either banner bank or islanders bank 
prompt corrective action federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
an institution s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures  which include a risk based capital measure  a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework 
under these regulations  an institution is treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets leverage ratio is or more  and it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level 
in order to be adequately capitalized  an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of not less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of not less than  and a leverage ratio of not less than 
any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements  regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized 
failure by either banner bank and islanders bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would  if unremedied  result in progressively more severe restrictions on their respective activities and lead to enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and  ultimately  the appointment of the fdic as receiver or conservator 
banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
additionally  approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements 
at december   both banner bank and islanders bank were categorized as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations of the fdic 
capital requirements federally insured financial institutions  such as banner bank and islanders bank  are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital 
fdic regulations recognize two types  or tiers  of capital core tier capital and supplementary tier capital 
tier capital generally includes common stockholders equity and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  less most intangible assets 
tier capital  which is limited to of tier capital  includes such items as qualifying general loan loss reserves  cumulative perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible debt  term subordinated debt and limited life preferred stock  however  the amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock original maturity of at least five years but less than years that may in included in tier capital is limited to of tier capital 
the fdic currently measures an institution s capital using a leverage limit together with certain risk based ratios 
the fdic s minimum leverage capital requirement specifies a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total assets 
most banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least to of total assets 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier leverage capital ratios of and  respectively 
the fdic retains the right to require a particular institution to maintain a higher capital level based on an institution s particular risk profile 
fdic regulations also establish a measure of capital adequacy based on ratios of qualifying capital to risk weighted assets 
assets are placed in one of four categories and given a percentage weight based on the relative risk of the category 
in addition  certain off balance sheet items are converted to balance sheet credit equivalent amounts  and each amount is then assigned to one of the four categories 
under the guidelines  the ratio of total capital tier capital plus tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least  and the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least 
in evaluating the adequacy of a bank s capital  the fdic may also consider other factors that may affect the bank s financial condition 
such factors may include interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  the quality and level of earnings  concentration of credit risk  risks arising from nontraditional activities  loan and investment quality  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies  and management s ability to monitor and control financial operating risks 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier risk based capital ratios of and  respectively  and total risk based capital ratios of and  respectively 
fdic capital requirements are designated as the minimum acceptable standards for banks whose overall financial condition is fundamentally sound  which are well managed and have no material or significant financial weaknesses 
the fdic capital regulations state that  where the fdic determines that the financial history or condition  including off balance sheet risk  managerial resources and or the future earnings prospects of a bank are not adequate and or a bank has a significant volume of assets classified substandard  doubtful or loss or otherwise criticized  the fdic may determine that the minimum adequate amount of capital for the bank is greater than the minimum standards established in the regulation 
the washington department of financial institutions requires that net worth equal at least of total assets 
intangible assets must be deducted from net worth and assets when computing compliance with this requirement 
at december   banner bank had a net worth of of total assets under this standard  while islanders bank had a similarly calculated net worth of 
we believe that  under the current regulations  banner bank and islanders bank exceed their minimum capital requirements 
however  events beyond the control of the banks  such as weak or depressed economic conditions in areas where they have most of their loans  could adversely affect future earnings and  consequently  the ability of the banks to meet their capital requirements 
for additional information concerning banner bank s and islanders bank s capital  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
emergency economic stabilization act of in october  the eesa was enacted 
the eesa authorizes the us treasury department to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to billion in mortgage loans  mortgage related securities and certain other financial instruments  including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program tarp 
the purpose of tarp is to restore confidence and stability to the us banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other 
under the tarp capital purchase program cpp  the treasury may purchase debt or equity securities from participating institutions 
the tarp also allows direct purchases or guarantees of troubled assets of financial institutions 
participants in the cpp are subject to executive compensation limits and are encouraged to expand their lending and mortgage loan modifications 
banner completed its tarp cpp transaction in the fourth quarter  receiving million in funding on november  for additional information regarding the tarp cpp transaction  see recent developments participation in the us treasury capital purchase program and risk factors risks related to our business risks specific to our participation in tarp 
eesa also increased federal deposit insurance corporation deposit insurance on most accounts from  to  this increase expires at the end of and is not covered by deposit insurance premiums paid by the banking industry 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra into law 
the arra is intended to revive the us economy by creating millions of new jobs and stemming home foreclosures 
for financial institutions that have received or will receive financial assistance under tarp or related programs  the arra significantly rewrites the original executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of section of the eesa 
among the most important changes instituted by the arra are new limits on the ability of tarp recipients to pay incentive compensation to up to of the next most highly compensated employees in addition to the senior executive officers  a restriction on termination of employment payments to senior executive officers and the five next most highly compensated employees and a requirement that tarp recipients implement say on pay shareholder votes 
further legislation is anticipated to be passed with respect to the economic recovery 
for additional information regarding the effects of the arra on banner s senior executive officers as a result of banner s participation in tarp  see risk factors risks related to our business risks specific to our participation in tarp 
the financial stability plan and homeowners affordability and stability plan 
in february  the administration announced its financial stability plan fsp and homeowners affordability and stability plan hasp 
many details of these plans have not been finalized 
the fsp is administrated by the us treasury and includes the following four key elements the development of a public private investment fund essentially structured as a government sponsored enterprise with the mission to purchase troubled assets from banks with an initial capitalization from government funds  the capital assistance program  under which the treasury will purchase additional preferred stock  available only for banks that have undergone a new stress test given by their regulator  an expansion of the federal reserve s term asset backed liquidity facility to support the purchase of up to trillion in aaa rated asset backed securities backed by consumer  student and small business loans and possibly other types of loans  and the establishment of a mortgage loan modification program further detailed in the hasp 
the hasp is a program developed to help seven to nine million families restructure their mortgages to avoid foreclosure 
the plan also develops guidance for loan modifications nationwide 
hasp provides programs and funding for eligible refinancing of loans  along with incentives to lenders  mortgage servicers  and borrowers to modify mortgages of responsible homeowners who are at risk of defaulting on their mortgage 
the goals of hasp are to assist in the prevention of home foreclosures and to help stabilize falling home prices 
although banner was a recipient of tarp cpp funds  it is unclear what effect these programs will have on its operations 
future recipients of tarp funds will be expected to comply with the loan modification guidance that the federal banking regulators establish in connection with hasp 
standards for safety and soundness the federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed  by regulation  guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  and compensation  fees and benefits 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative  technical  and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities 
the information security program also must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information  protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer  and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information 
each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems 
if the fdic determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines  it may require an institution to submit to the fdic an acceptable plan to achieve compliance 
we believe that at december   banner bank and islanders bank met all of the fdic guidelines 
guidance on subprime mortgage lending in response to the recent subprime mortgage crisis  federal and state regulatory agencies have focused attention on subprime and nontraditional mortgage products both with an aim toward enhancing the regulation of such loans and providing relief to adversely affected borrowers 
on july   the federal banking agencies issued guidance on subprime mortgage lending to address issues related to certain mortgage products marketed to subprime borrowers  particularly adjustable rate mortgage products that can involve payment shock and other risky characteristics 
although the guidance focuses on subprime borrowers  the banking agencies note that institutions should look to the principles contained in the guidance when offering such adjustable rate mortgages to non subprime borrowers 
the guidance prohibits predatory lending programs  provides that institutions should underwrite a mortgage loan on the borrower s ability to repay the debt by its final maturity at the fully indexed rate  assuming a fully amortizing repayment schedule  encourages reasonable workout arrangements with borrowers who are in default  mandates clear and balanced advertisements and other communications  encourages arrangements for the escrowing of real estate taxes and insurance  and states that institutions should develop strong control and monitoring systems 
the guidance recommends that institutions refer to the real estate lending standards discussed above which provide underwriting standards for all real estate loans 
the federal banking agencies announced their intention to carefully review the risk management and consumer compliance processes  policies and procedures of their supervised financial institutions and their intention is to take action against institutions that engage in predatory lending practices  violate consumer protection laws or fair lending laws  engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices  or otherwise engage in unsafe or unsound lending practices 
guidance on loss mitigation strategies for servicers of residential mortgages in september  the federal banking agencies issued a statement encouraging regulated institutions and state supervised entities that service residential mortgages to pursue strategies to mitigate losses while preserving homeownership to the extent possible and appropriate 
the guidance recognizes that many mortgage loans  including subprime loans  have been transferred into securitization trusts and servicing for such loans is governed by contract documents 
the guidance advises servicers to review governing documentation to determine the full extent of their authority to restructure loans that are delinquent or are in default or are in imminent risk of default 
the guidance encourages that servicers take proactive steps to preserve homeownership in situations where there are heightened risks to homeowners losing their homes to foreclosures 
such steps may include loan modification  deferral of payments  extensions of loan maturities  conversion of adjustable rate mortgages into fixed rate or fully indexed  fully amortizing adjustable rate mortgages  capitalization of delinquent amounts  or any combination of these actions 
servicers are instructed to consider the borrower s ability to repay the modified obligation to final maturity according to its terms  taking into account the borrower s total monthly housing related payments as a percentage of the borrower s gross monthly income  the borrower s other obligations  and any additional tax liabilities that may result from loan modifications 
where appropriate  servicers are encouraged to refer borrowers to qualified non profit and other homeownership counseling services and or to government programs that are able to work with all parties and avoid unnecessary foreclosures 
the guidance states that servicers are expected to treat consumers fairly and to adhere to all applicable legal requirements 
relief for homeowners in october  the treasury helped facilitate the creation of the hope now alliance  a private sector coalition formed to encourage mortgage servicers  mortgage counselors  government officials and non profit groups to coordinate their efforts to help struggling borrowers restructure their mortgage payments and stay in their homes 
hope now is aimed at coordinating and improving outreach to borrowers  developing best practices for mortgage counselors across the country and ensuring that groups able to help homeowners work out new loan arrangements with lenders have adequate resources to carry out this mission 
treasury has worked with other agencies and hope now to create a streamlined loan modification program 
in october  hud implemented hope for homeowners  a voluntary fha program for refinancing affordable home mortgages 
housing and economic recovery act of the housing and economic recovery act of  signed by president bush on july   was designed to address a variety of issues relating to the subprime mortgage crises 
this act established a new conforming loan limit for fannie mae and freddie mac in high cost areas to of the conforming loan limit  to take effect after december  the fha s conforming loan limit was increased from to of the area median home price up to of the fannie mae freddie mac conforming loan limit  to take effect at the same time 
among other things  the housing and economic recovery act of enhanced the regulation of fannie mae  freddie mac and federal housing administration loans  established a new federal housing finance agency to replace the prior federal housing finance board and office of federal housing enterprise oversight  required enhanced mortgage disclosures  and initiated a comprehensive licensing  supervisory  and tracking system for mortgage originators 
using its new powers  on september   the federal housing finance agency announced that it had put fannie mae and freddie mac under conservatorship 
the housing and economic recovery act of also established the hope for homeowners program  which is a new  temporary  voluntary program to back federal housing administration insured mortgages to distressed borrowers 
the new mortgages offered by federal housing administration approved lenders will refinance distressed loans at a significant discount for owner occupants at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure 
new regulations establishing protections for consumers in the residential mortgage market the federal reserve board has issued new regulations under the federal truth in lending act and the home ownership and equity protection act 
for mortgage loans governed by the home ownership and equity protection act  the new regulations further restrict prepayment penalties  and enhance the standards relating to the consumer s ability to repay 
for a new category of closed end higher priced mortgage loans  the new regulations restrict prepayment penalties  and require escrows for property taxes and property related insurance for most first lien mortgage loans 
for all closed end loans secured by a principal dwelling  the new regulations prohibit the coercion of appraisers  require the prompt crediting of payments  prohibit the pyramiding of late fees  require prompt responses to requests for payoff figures  and require the delivery of transaction specific truth in lending act disclosures within three business days following the receipt of an application for a closed end home loan 
the new regulations also impose new restrictions on mortgage loan advertising for both open end and closed end products 
in general  the new regulations are effective october   but the rules governing escrows for higher priced mortgages are effective on april   and for higher priced mortgage loans secured by manufactured housing  on october  pending legislation and regulatory proposals as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis and current financial conditions  federal and state legislatures and agencies are considering a broad variety of legislative and regulatory proposals covering mortgage loan products  loan terms and underwriting standards  risk management practices and consumer protection

guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risks on september   the federal banking agencies issued guidance to address the risks posed by nontraditional residential mortgage products  that is  mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal or interest 
the guidance instructs institutions to ensure that loan terms and underwriting standards are consistent with prudent lending practices  including consideration of a borrower s ability to repay the debt by final maturity at the fully indexed rate and assuming a fully amortizing repayment schedule  requires institutions to recognize  for higher risk loans  the necessity of verifying the borrower s income  assets and liabilities  requires institutions to address the risks associated with simultaneous second lien loans  introductory interest rates  lending to subprime borrowers  nonowner occupied investor loans  and reduced documentation loans  requires institutions to recognize that nontraditional mortgages  particularly those with risk layering features  are untested in a stressed environment  requires institutions to recognize that nontraditional mortgage products warrant strong controls and risk management standards  capital levels commensurate with that risk  and allowances for loan and lease losses that reflect the collectability of the portfolio  and ensure that consumers have sufficient information to clearly understand loan terms and associated risks prior to making product and payment choices 
the guidance recommends practices for addressing the risks raised by nontraditional mortgages  including enhanced communications with consumers  beginning when the consumer is first shopping for a mortgage  promotional materials and other product descriptions that provide information about the costs  terms  features and risks of nontraditional mortgages  including with respect to payment shock  negative amortization  prepayment penalties  and the cost of reduced documentation loans  more informative monthly statements for payment option adjustable rate mortgages  and specified practices to avoid 
subsequently  the federal banking agencies produced model disclosures that are designed to provide information about the costs  terms  features and risks of nontraditional mortgages 
guidance on real estate concentrations on december   the federal banking agencies issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution 
the purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations 
the guidance directs the federal deposit insurance corporation and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk 
a bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan  or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent or more of the bank s capital  or total commercial real estate loans as defined in the guidance represent or more of the bank s total capital and the outstanding balance of the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased or more during the prior months 
the guidance provides that the strength of an institution s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy 
on march   the federal deposit insurance corporation issued a release to re emphasize the importance of strong capital and loan loss allowance levels and robust credit risk management practices for institutions with concentrated commercial real estate exposures 
the federal deposit insurance corporation suggested that institutions with significant construction land development and commercial real estate loan concentrations increase or maintain strong capital levels  ensure that loan loss allowances are appropriately strong  manage construction and development and commercial real estate loan portfolios closely  maintain updated financial and analytical information on their borrowers and collateral  and bolster the loan workout infrastructure 
temporary liquidity guaranty program following a systemic risk determination  the federal deposit insurance corporation established a temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp on october  the tlgp includes the transaction account guarantee program  which provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage through december  for noninterest bearing transaction accounts typically business checking accounts and certain funds swept into noninterest bearing savings accounts tagp

the tlgp also includes the debt guarantee program dgp  under which the federal deposit insurance corporation guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of federal deposit insurance corporation insured institutions and their holding companies 
the unsecured debt must be issued on or after october  and not later than june   and the guarantee is effective through the earlier of the maturity date or june  the dgp coverage limit is generally of the eligible entity s eligible debt outstanding on september  and scheduled to mature on or before june  or  for certain insured institutions  of their liabilities as of september  depending on the term of the debt maturity  the nonrefundable dgp fee ranges from to basis points annualized for covered debt outstanding until the earlier of maturity or june  the tagp and dgp are in effect for all eligible entities  unless the entity opted out on or before december  banner and islanders bank did not opt out of the program

our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
interstate banking and branching the federal reserve must approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of  or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of  a bank located in a state other than the holding company s home state  without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state 
the federal reserve may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period not exceeding five years specified by the statutory law of the host state 
nor may the federal reserve approve an application if the applicant and its depository institution affiliates controls or would control more than of the insured deposits in the united states or or more of the deposits in the target bank s home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch 
federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out of state banks or bank holding companies 
individual states may also waive the state wide concentration limit contained in the federal law 
the federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state  unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to june  which applies equally to all out of state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out of state banks 
interstate acquisitions of branches and de novo branching will be permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions 
interstate mergers and branch acquisitions will also be subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above 
dividends the federal reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses its view that although there are no specific regulations restricting dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws  a bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
capital requirements the federal reserve has established capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital requirements of the fdic for the banks  although the federal reserve regulations provide for the inclusion of certain trust preferred securities for up to of tier capital in determining compliance with the guidelines 
the federal reserve regulations provide that capital standards will be applied on a consolidated basis in the case of a bank holding company with million or more in total consolidated assets 
the guidelines require that a company s total risk based capital must equal of risk weighted assets and one half of the must consist of tier core capital 
as of december   banner corporation s total risk based capital was of risk weighted assets and its tier core capital was of risk weighted assets 
stock repurchases a bank holding company  except for certain well capitalized and highly rated bank holding companies  is required to give the federal reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months  is equal to or more of its consolidated net worth

item a risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties described below  other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
risks related to the us financial industry difficult economic and market conditions have adversely affected our industry 
we are particularly exposed to downturns in the us housing market and general economic conditions 
dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities  major commercial and investment banks  and regional financial institutions such as our company 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets have adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the economy and financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we potentially face increased regulation of our industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
continued economic weakness may result in increased delinquencies and defaults in our loan portfolio  which would adversely affect our operating results 
the process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 
the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
we may be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
recently enacted legislation and other measures undertaken by the us treasury  the federal reserve and other governmental agencies may not be successful in stabilizing the us financial system or improving the housing markets 
for further information  see business regulation 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than a year 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  our ability to access capital and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
risks related to our business our business is subject to general economic risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the states of washington  oregon and idaho and the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers located primarily in these three states 
the local economic conditions in our market areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
adverse economic conditions unique to these northwest markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets  increases in credit costs or other factors could impact these state and local markets and  in turn  also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
beginning in and throughout  the housing market in the united states has experienced significant adverse trends  including accelerated price depreciation in some markets and rising delinquency and default rates 
as a result of these trends  we experienced an increase in delinquency and default rates particularly on construction and land loans in our primary market areas 
these trends if they continue or worsen could cause further credit losses and loan loss provisioning and could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
weakness in the washington  oregon or idaho real estate markets has hurt our business 
our business activities and credit exposure are primarily concentrated in parts of washington  oregon and idaho and  as of december   substantially all of our real estate loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by properties located in these states 
while we did not participate in any sub prime loan programs  our construction and land loan portfolios  our commercial and multifamily loan portfolios and certain of our other loans have been affected by the downturn in the residential real estate market 
during  evidence of this downturn became more apparent in certain of the washington  oregon and idaho markets we serve 
if real estate values continue to decline  especially in washington  oregon or idaho  the collateral for our loans will provide less security 
as a result  our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished  and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
the events and conditions described in this risk factor could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be required to make further increases in our provisions for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
as noted in other sections of this annual report on form k  we are experiencing increasing loan delinquencies and credit losses and we substantially increased our provision for loan losses in  which adversely affected our results of operations 
with the exception of residential construction and land development loans  non performing loans and assets generally reflect unique operating difficulties for individual borrowers rather than weakness in the overall economy of the pacific northwest  however  more recently the deteriorating pace of economic activity has become a significant contributing factor 
slower sales and excess inventory in certain housing markets have been the primary cause of the increase in delinquencies and foreclosures for residential construction and land development loans  which represent of our non performing assets at december  further  our portfolio is concentrated in construction and land loans and commercial and multifamily loans  all of which have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans 
if current trends in the housing and real estate markets continue  we expect that we will continue to experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses 
moreover  if a prolonged recession occurs we expect that it could severely impact economic conditions in our market areas and that we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses 
as a result  we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we could face future assessments to guarantee public funds in washington state 
we accept state and local municipality deposits from washington state public treasurers as a qualified public depositary under the state s public deposit protection act administered by the public deposit protection commission 
as of december  we held million in washington public funds 
washington law requires qualified banks and thrifts to pledge eligible collateral into a collateral pool administered by the commission to mutually guarantee with other members of the pool against a loss of funds suffered by a public treasurer as a result of a failure by a member of the pool 
generally  our maximum liability should any member s of the collateral pool default on their uninsured public funds is limited to of public funds we hold 
we meet the minimum standards under the law and historically were only required to pledge collateral at least equal to of the public deposits we hold 
however  in february  the commission notified us that it was adjusting the collateral requirement for all qualified depositaries to  effective july  we also accept public fund deposits in the state of oregon subject to a similar arrangement  including a collateralization requirement and loss sharing provision 
as of december   we held million in oregon public funds 
in washington  the bank collateral pool  of which we are a member  had its first assessment for a loss of uninsured public deposits by any member of the pool in the first quarter of and our proportionate charge was  which we remitted and expensed in february while we have not had any such charges in oregon  should additional bank failures occur in the future in either state  we may be liable for additional assessments 
legislation has been introduced in both states to address concerns raised by recent bank failures and the fdic s actions with respect to uninsured deposits of public entities 
there can be no assurances that any changes in these programs will be beneficial to us 
our ability to foreclose on single family home loans may be restricted 
new legislation proposed by congress may give bankruptcy judges the power to reduce the increasing number of home foreclosures 
bankruptcy judges would be given the authority to restructure mortgages and reduce a borrower s payments 
property owners would be allowed to keep their property while working out their debts 
further  the proposal provides for government subsidies for reducing a borrower s interest rate  which a lender would have to match with its own money 
this legislation would restrict our collection efforts on one to four family loans 
we may suffer losses in our loan portfolio despite our underwriting practices 
we seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices 
although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make  we may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria  and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our allowance for loan losses 
risks specific to our participation in tarp 
impact on executive compensation 
as a participant in the treasury s cpp  we became subject to the executive compensation requirements under the cpp  the eesa and treasury regulations 
the requirements that apply to us and our named executive officers are as follows incentive compensation arrangements may not encourage officers to take unnecessary risks  any bonus or incentive compensation paid to an officer based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proved to be materially inaccurate must be repaid known as clawback  and payments to an officer upon termination of employment may not exceed times the officer s base amount as defined in section g of the internal revenue code of known as a golden parachute payment 
in addition  our compensation committee must identify the features in the named executive officers compensation arrangements that could lead officers to take unnecessary and excessive risks that could threaten banner s value 
the committee must also have a meeting at least annually with banner s senior risk officers to discuss and review the relationship between banner s risk management policies and practices and named executive officer compensation arrangements 
banner became subject to the additional executive compensation limitations in connection with the enactment of arra on february  the arra amends  among other things  the tarp legislation by directing the treasury department to issue regulations implementing strict limitations on compensation paid or accrued by financial institutions  such as banner  participating in the tarp 
these limitations are to include a prohibition on any compensation plan that would encourage manipulation of reported earnings  subjecting bonus  incentive and retention payments made to the named executive officers and the next most highly compensated employees to recovery if based on statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria that are later found to be materially inaccurate  a prohibition on making golden parachute payments in any amount to the named executive officers and the next five most highly compensated employees for departure from banner other than compensation earned for services rendered or accrued benefits  and a prohibition on paying bonus  incentive or retention compensation to the named executive officers  other than certain awards of long term restricted stock or bonuses payable under existing employment agreements 
in addition  the board of directors must adopt a policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  such as entertainment or events  office renovations and other activities that are not reasonable expenditures for staff development 
banner is also required to submit a say on pay proposal to a non biding vote of shareholders at future annual meetings  whereby shareholders vote to approve the compensation of executives as disclosed pursuant to the executive compensation disclosures included in the proxy statement 
this proposal will be presented at the annual meeting of shareholders and is described in our proxy statement under proposal advisory vote on executive compensation 
in addition  there are a number of certifications by the chief executive officer  chief financial officer and compensation committee that will be required in connection with these regulations 
finally  the treasury department is required to review any bonus  retention awards or other compensation paid to our named executive officers and the next most highly compensated employees prior to february  to determine if these payments were excessive and negotiate for the reimbursement of any such excess payments 
the arra directs the treasury department to issue regulations implementing the executive compensation restrictions 
many questions remain regarding the scope of the limitations and the requirements of the arra because none of the regulations mandated by the law have been issued to date 
pending the issuance of regulations  we are reviewing the requirements of the arra  its impact on compensation  and the effect of its requirements on our compensation arrangements 
actions required by the arra and consideration of competitive factors may include changes to the form and amount of compensation paid to our executive officers  including adjustments to base salaries  the reduction or elimination of bonus compensation  issuance of long term restricted stock awards and modifications to existing agreements 
the securities purchase agreement between us and treasury limits our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock 
the securities purchase agreement between us and treasury provides that prior to the earlier of i november  and ii the date on which all of the shares of the series a preferred stock have been redeemed by us or transferred by treasury to third parties  we may not  without the consent of treasury  a increase the cash dividend on our common stock or b subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock other than the series a preferred stock or trust preferred securities 
in addition  we are unable to pay any dividends on our common stock unless we are current in our dividend payments on the series a preferred stock 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant described in the next risk factor  could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
moreover  holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future 
the series a preferred stock impacts net income available to our common shareholders and earnings per common share and the warrant we issued to treasury may be dilutive to holders of our common stock 
the dividends declared on the series a preferred stock will reduce the net income available to common shareholders and our earnings per common share 
the series a preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up of banner corporation 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant we issued to treasury in conjunction with the sale of the series a preferred stock is exercised 
the shares of common stock underlying the warrant represent approximately of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in total shares outstanding 
although treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction 
the federal banking laws limit the ownership of our common stock 
because we are a bank holding company  purchasers of or more of our common stock may be required to obtain approvals under the change in bank control act of  as amended  or bank holding company act of  as amended and in certain cases such approvals may be required at a lesser percentage of ownership 
specifically  under regulations adopted by the federal reserve  a any other bank holding company may be required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve to acquire or retain or more of the common stock and b any person other than a bank holding company may be required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve to acquire or retain or more of the common stock 
recent negative developments in the financial industry and credit markets may continue to adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
negative developments beginning in the latter half of in the sub prime mortgage market and the securitization markets for such loans  together with other factors  have resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets in general and a related general economic downturn  throughout and into many lending institutions  including us  have experienced substantial declines in the performance of their loans  including construction and land loans  multifamily loans  commercial loans and consumer loans 
moreover  competition among depository institutions for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many construction and land  commercial and multifamily and other commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have been negatively affected  as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
these conditions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  as a result of the foregoing factors  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of formal enforcement orders 
further negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments could restrict our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the washington  oregon or idaho markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
in addition  recent changes in the collateralization requirements and other provisions of the washington and oregon public funds deposit programs have changed the economic benefit associated with accepting public funds deposits  which may affect our need to utilize alternative sources of liquidity 
uninsured deposits 
in the fourth quarter of  the federal deposit insurance corporation increased the federal insurance of deposits accounts from  to  and provided insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts for participating members  including banner bank 
these increases in coverage  with the exception of ira and certain retirement accounts are set to expire at the end of congress is considering the extension of these deposit insurance increases 
with the increase of bank failures  depositors are reviewing deposit relationships to maximize federal deposit insurance coverage 
we may see outflows of uninsured deposits as customers restructure their banking relationships in setting up multiple accounts in multiple banks to maximize federal deposit insurance coverage 
we may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or we may otherwise elect or to raise additional capital 
in that regard  a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital as a result of a deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market  deteriorating economic conditions  declines in real estate values and other factors 
should we be required by regulatory authorities to raise additional capital  we may seek to do so through the issuance of  among other things  our common stock or preferred stock  which could dilute your ownership interest in the company 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
there are regulatory and contractual limitations that may limit or prevent us from paying dividends on the common stock and we may limit or eliminate our dividends to shareholders 
as a washington corporation  under washington law we are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends 
in addition  as a bank holding company  banner corporation s ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations 
banner corporation is an entity separate and distinct from its principal subsidiaries  banner bank and islanders bank  and derives substantially all of its revenue in the form of dividends from those subsidiaries 
accordingly  banner corporation is and will be dependent upon dividends from banner bank and islanders bank to pay the principal of and interest on its indebtedness  to satisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on its common stock 
banner bank s and islanders bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to their ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements 
in the event the banks are unable to pay dividends to banner corporation  it may not be able to service its debt  pay its obligations or pay dividends on banner corporation s common stock 
see regulations dividends and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
also  banner corporation s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
banner corporation is also subject to certain contractual restrictions that could prohibit it from declaring or paying dividends or making liquidation payments on its common stock 
see if we defer payments of interest on our outstanding junior subordinated debentures or if certain defaults relating to those debentures occur  we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on  and from making liquidation payments with respect to  our common stock below 
for information regarding our participation in tarp and its effective on the payment of dividends  see risks specific to our participation in tarp included herein 
our board of directors regularly reviews our dividend policy in light of current economic conditions for financial institutions as well as our capital needs and any applicable contractual restrictions 
on a quarterly basis  the board of directors determines whether a dividend will be paid and in what amount  if any 
if we defer payments of interest on our outstanding junior subordinated debentures or if certain defaults relating to those debentures occur  we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on  and from making liquidation payments with respect to  our common stock 
we have issued a significant amount of junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities by certain of our subsidiaries that are statutory business trusts 
we have also guaranteed those trust preferred securities 
there are currently six separate series of these junior subordinated debentures outstanding  each series having been issued under a separate indenture and with a separate guarantee 
each of these indentures  together with the related guarantee  prohibits us  subject to limited exceptions  from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on  or redeeming  repurchasing  acquiring or making any liquidation payments with respect to  any of our capital stock at any time when i there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under such indenture or any event  act or condition that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an event of default under such indenture  or ii we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under such guarantee  or iii we have deferred payment of interest on the junior subordinated debentures outstanding under that indenture 
in that regard  we are entitled  at our option but subject to certain conditions  to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debentures of each series from time to time for up to five years 
events of default under each indenture generally consist of our failure to pay interest on the junior subordinated debentures outstanding under that indenture under certain circumstances  our failure to pay any principal of or premium on such junior subordinated debentures when due  our failure to comply with certain covenants under such indenture  and certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or liquidation relating to us or  in the case of certain of these indentures  any of our significant subsidiaries as defined that is a depository institution 
as a result of these provisions  if we were to elect to defer payments of interest on any series of junior subordinated debentures  or if any of the other events described in clause i or ii of the first paragraph of this risk factor were to occur  we would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on the common stock  from repurchasing or otherwise acquiring any such common stock  and from making any payments to holders of common stock in the event of our liquidation  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
moreover  without notice to or consent from the holders of our common stock  we may issue additional series of junior subordinated debentures in the future with terms similar to those of our existing junior subordinated debentures or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock  including our common stock 
the maturity and repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities are mismatched and subject us to interest rate risk which could adversely affect our net earnings and economic value 
our financial condition and operations are influenced significantly by general economic conditions  including the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received from our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest bearing liabilities 
significant changes in market interest rates or errors or misjudgments in our interest rate risk management procedures could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and economic value 
we currently believe that declining interest rates will adversely affect our near term net earnings 
our activities  like all financial institutions  inherently involve the assumption of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on our earnings and underlying economic value 
interest rate risk is determined by the maturity and repricing characteristics of our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
interest rate risk is measured by the variability of financial performance and economic value resulting from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting our financial performance 
we believe that the greatest source of interest rate risk to us results from the mismatch of maturities or repricing intervals for our rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
this mismatch or gap is generally characterized by a substantially shorter maturity structure for interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets 
additional interest rate risk results from mismatched repricing indices and formulae basis risk and yield curve risk  and product caps and floors and early repayment or withdrawal provisions option risk  which may be contractual or market driven  that are generally more favorable to customers than to us 
our primary monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is asset liability simulation modeling  which is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  interest rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income and net market value of equity resulting from those movements under different rate environments 
we update and prepare our simulation modeling at least quarterly for review by senior management and our directors 
we believe the data and assumptions are realistic representations of our portfolio and possible outcomes under the various interest rate scenarios 
nonetheless  the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income and net market value of our equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used and  as a result  our interest rate risk management strategies may prove to be inadequate 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and market risk and asset liability management for additional information concerning interest rate risk 
our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
we originate construction and land loans  commercial and multifamily mortgage loans  commercial business loans  consumer loans  agricultural mortgage loans and agricultural loans as well as residential mortgage loans primarily within our market areas 
generally  the types of loans other than the residential mortgage loans have a higher risk of loss than the residential mortgage loans 
we had approximately billion outstanding in these types of higher risk loans at december  which is an amount relatively unchanged from december  these loans have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the reasons discussed under item  business lending activities and for the following reasons construction and land loans 
this type of lending contains the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost including interest of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
in addition  speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre sold  and thus pose a greater potential risk to us than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences 
loans on land under development or held for future construction also poses additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the security 
these risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions 
as a result  this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property  rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
during the years ended december  and  we significantly increased our origination of construction and land loans 
while new construction loan originations decreased by approximately in and an additional in  we continue to have a significant investment in construction loan balances 
most of our construction loans are for the construction of single family residences 
commercial and multifamily mortgage loans 
these loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans  and repayment is dependent upon income being generated from the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service  which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions 
commercial and multifamily mortgage loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate 
in addition  many of our commercial and multifamily real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity 
such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment  which may increase the risk of default or non payment  which risk is exacerbated in this current economic environment 
commercial business loans 
our commercial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
the borrowers cash flow may be unpredictable  and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value 
most often  this collateral is accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or real estate 
in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
agricultural loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either us or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates among others 
collateral securing these loans may be difficult to evaluate  manage or liquidate and may not provide an adequate source of repayment 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
for additional information  see item i  business lending and item  management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations asset quality 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could be reduced 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and the loss and delinquency experience  and evaluate economic conditions 
management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios  new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in the need for additions to our allowance through an increase in the provision for loan losses 
material additions to the allowance or increases in our provision for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses was of total loans  and of nonperforming loans  less loans in process  at december  in addition  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may face risks with respect to our recent acquisitions and future expansion 
we completed three acquisitions in and may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future 
we also plan to continue to engage in additional de novo branch expansion although at a slower pace than in we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
these activities involve a number of risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses  entry into new markets where we lack experience  the introduction of new products and services into our business  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on our results of operations  and the risk of loss of key employees and customers 
we may incur substantial costs to acquire other companies  businesses or assets in the future  and the results of any such acquisition may not meet our expectations or enhance our results of operations 
we may also incur substantial expenses integrating the operations of any acquired company  business or assets with our existing operations 
in that regard  although we have no current integration plans  islanders bank  which we acquired in  is currently utilizing the same accounting and financial systems that it had in place prior to the time of the acquisition  and we will incur expenses  which could be substantial  should we choose to migrate islanders bank to our accounting and financial systems 
also  we may issue equity securities  including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders and to investors purchasing common stock 
if we are not able to achieve profitability on new branches it will negatively affect our results of operations 
we have expanded our presence throughout the market area  and although the pace of our de novo branch expansion slowed considerably in  we intend to pursue further expansion by opening additional new branches 
the success of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the revenue that we generate from the new branches will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these branches 
largely as a result of this de novo branching strategy  our operating expenses have increased significantly  adversely affecting our operating efficiency 
as a result  the efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of non interest expense to net interest income and other income  is higher than many of our competitor institutions 
we expect that it may take a period of time before certain of these branches can become profitable  especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence and it is possible that some of these branches may not achieve profitability 
as a result  the expense of operating these branches may negatively affect our results of operations 
if external funds were not available  this could adversely impact our growth and prospects 
we rely on deposits and advances from the fhlb of seattle and other borrowings to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if our financial condition or the financial condition of the fhlb of seattle or market conditions were to change 
while we consider such sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs  we may be compelled or elect to seek additional sources of financing in the future 
likewise  we may seek additional debt in the future to achieve our long term business objectives  in connection with future acquisitions or for other reasons 
additional borrowings  if sought  may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on reasonable terms 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms  our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our deposit insurance assessments will increase substantially  which will adversely affect our profits 
our fdic deposit insurance assessments expense for the year ended december  was million 
deposit insurance assessments will increase in as a result of recent strains on the fdic deposit insurance fund resulting from the cost of recent bank failures and an increase in the number of banks likely to fail over the next few years 
the current rates for fdic assessments range from to basis points  depending on the financial health of the insured institution 
on december   the fdic issued a final rule increasing that assessment range to to basis points for the first quarter of for the remainder of  the fdic has proposed a range of to basis points for institutions that do not trigger the brokered deposits adjustment  the secured liability adjustment  or the unsecured debt adjustment 
for institutions that are subject to those adjustments  the fdic proposes rate assessments in the range of eight to basis points 
in this regard  the brokered deposit adjustment can range from to ten basis points  the secured liability adjustment which includes  among others  fhlb advances  securities sold under repurchase agreements  secured federal funds purchased  and certain other secured borrowings can range from to basis points  and the unsecured debt adjustment can range from minus two to basis points 
the fdic has stated that it may need to set a higher base rate schedule at the time of the issuance of its final assessment rate rule  depending upon the information available at that time including  without limitation  on its updated bank failure and loss projections 
the fdic s proposal would continue to allow it to adopt actual assessment rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates without the necessity of further notice and comment rulemaking  although this power is subject to several limitations 
on february   the federal deposit insurance corporation adopted an interim rule imposing a basis point emergency special assessment on federal deposit insurance corporation insured institutions on june  the assessment is to be collected on september  the interim rule would also permit the federal deposit insurance corporation to impose an emergency special assessment after june   of up to basis points if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
it is expected that our assessment for the initial basis point charge provided under this new interim rule would be approximately million and no assurances can be made with respect to possible future assessments 
strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and adversely affect our operating results 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
we compete in our market areas with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do  have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business  and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do 
our results of operations depend upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas 
the greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase or maintain our interest earning assets 
in that regard  the negative economic conditions that began in and that have continued in have significantly reduced our origination of new loans  and we cannot assure you that our total loans or assets will increase or not decline in for additional information see item  business competition 
the loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management 
their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us 
the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense  and the loss of any of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to extensive government regulation which could adversely affect our business 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations 
because our business is highly regulated  the laws  rules and regulations applicable to it are subject to regular modification and change 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in this regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  prospects or profitability 
see item business regulation banner bank and islanders bank 
the level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny 
the fdic  the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency  have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
under the guidance  a financial institution actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations 
a financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if  among other factors  i total reported loans for construction  land development  and other land represent or more of total capital or ii total reported loans secured by multifamily and non farm residential properties  loans for construction  land development and other land and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market  including loans to commercial real estate related entities  represent or more of total capital 
management should also employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning  development of underwriting standards  risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing 
while we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with the guidance  bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance which could result in additional costs to us 
our business is affected from time to time by federal and state laws and regulations relating to hazardous substances 
under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  owners and operators of properties containing hazardous substances may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the substances 
cercla and similar state laws can affect us both as an owner of branches and other properties used in our business and as a lender holding a security interest in property which is found to contain hazardous substances 
while cercla contains an exemption for holders of security interests  the exemption is not available if the holder participates in the management of a property  and some courts have broadly defined what constitutes participation in management of property 
moreover  cercla and similar state statutes can affect our decision whether or not to foreclose on a property 
before foreclosing on commercial real estate  our general policy is to obtain an environmental report  thereby increasing the costs of foreclosure 
in addition  the existence of hazardous substances on a property securing a troubled loan may cause us to elect not to foreclose on the property  thereby reducing our flexibility in handling the loan 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on dividends from subsidiaries for most of our revenue 
banner corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiaries 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that banner bank  islanders bank and certain non bank subsidiaries may pay to banner corporation 
also  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event the banks are unable to pay dividends to banner corporation  we may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on banner corporation s common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from the banks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item  business regulation 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  and  as a result  investors and depositors could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could adversely affect our business  the trading price of our stock and our ability to attract additional deposits 
in connection with the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of act and the implementation of the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec  we document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the act 
this requires us to prepare an annual management report on our internal control over financial reporting  including among other matters  management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and an attestation report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments 
if we fail to identify and correct any significant deficiencies in the design or operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud  current and potential shareholders and depositors could lose confidence in our internal controls and financial reporting  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  the trading price of our stock and our ability to attract additional deposits

executive overview we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of washington and own two subsidiary banks  banner bank and  subsequent to may   islanders bank 
banner bank is a washington chartered commercial bank that conducts business from its main office in walla walla  washington and  as of december   its branch offices and loan production offices located in washington  oregon and idaho 
islanders bank is also a washington chartered commercial bank and conducts its business from three locations in san juan county  washington 
as of december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and total stockholders equity of million 
banner bank is a regional bank which offers a wide variety of commercial banking services and financial products to individuals  businesses and public sector entities in its primary market areas 
islanders bank is a community bank which offers similar banking services to individuals  businesses and public entities located in the san juan islands 
the banks primary business is that of traditional banking institutions  accepting deposits and originating loans in locations surrounding their offices in portions of washington  oregon and idaho 
banner bank is also an active participant in the secondary market  engaging in mortgage banking operations largely through the origination and sale of one to four family residential loans 
lending activities include commercial business and commercial real estate loans  agriculture business loans  construction and land development loans  one to four family residential loans and consumer loans 
see item business 
branch expansion has been a significant element in our strategy to grow loans  deposits and customer relationships 
over the past several years  we have invested significantly in expanding our branch and distributions systems with a primary emphasis on expanding our presence in the four largest areas of commerce in the northwest the puget sound region of washington and the greater boise  idaho  portland  oregon  and spokane  washington markets 
as a result of our franchise expansion  we have added new branches through acquisitions  opened new branches and relocated eight others since march  in alone  we opened ten branches  relocated five others and closed three acquisitions  and in  we opened two additional branches 
in large part because of this expansion activity  we have experienced loan growth of billion and deposit growth of billion over the last four year period 
the acquisitions and new branches have increased our presence within desirable markets and allow us to better serve existing and future customers 
this emphasis on growth has resulted in an elevated level of operating expenses  however  we believe that over time these new branches should help improve profitability by providing lower cost core deposits which will allow us to proportionately reduce higher cost borrowings as a source of funds 
we have reached our goal in terms of the number of branches we believe are needed to generate deposit growth sufficient to fund our expected loan growth and produce significant fee generating opportunities 
as a result  we plan a more moderate pace of branch expansion going forward 
we completed the acquisitions of f m bank and san juan financial holding company effective may   and ncw community bank effective october  sjfhc was merged into banner and its wholly owned subsidiary  islanders bank  has continued operations as a subsidiary of banner 
f m and ncw were merged into banner bank upon acquisition and now operate under the banner bank name 
the financial results for the year ended december  include the assets  liabilities and results of operations for all three of the recently acquired companies 
the financial results for the year ended december  include the assets  liabilities and results of operations for the three acquired companies from their respective acquisition dates 
deteriorating economic conditions and ongoing strains in the financial and housing markets which accelerated throughout presented an unusually challenging environment for banks and their holding companies  including banner corporation 
this was particularly evident in our need to provide for credit losses at a significantly higher level than our historical experience 
we had a net loss of million  or per diluted share available to common shareholders  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to the year ended december  the increase in the provision for loan losses in the current year reflects material increases in delinquencies  non performing loans and net charge offs  particularly for loans for the construction of one to four family homes and for acquisition and development of land for residential properties 
the current year s results were also adversely affected by a million write off of goodwill  as well as by a substantially narrower net interest margin 
the challenging environment and faltering equity markets also caused us to take a hard look at the carrying value of goodwill and to conclude that it was appropriate to record a non cash write off of that asset 
at least annually  and more often if appropriate  all companies are required to determine the value of goodwill as an asset 
we initially recorded a million impairment charge during the quarter ended june  we subsequently recorded an additional million charge in the quarter ended december   resulting in the complete elimination of goodwill from our balance sheet and a total million goodwill write off for the year ended december  while there is currently a great deal of uncertainty with respect to the market valuation of certain assets  declining stock prices for financial service companies clearly indicate that the value of goodwill for the industry has been severely diminished 
as a result of the significant reduction in most banks stock prices  including banr s  and the lack of merger transactions in recent months  measuring the value of goodwill has become difficult and imprecise at best  however  we concluded that continuing to record it as an asset would be inappropriate 
the write off of goodwill was a non cash charge that did not affect our liquidity or operations 
also  since goodwill is excluded from regulatory capital  the impairment charge which was not deductable for tax purposes did not have an adverse effect on the regulatory capital ratios of the company or either of our subsidiary banks  each of which continues to remain well capitalized under the regulatory requirements 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our results for the year ended december  included a net gain of million million after tax  compared to a net gain of million million after tax in the year ended december   for fair value adjustments as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
and while the net effect of these adjustments was a gain  the valuation adjustments of certain individual assets and liabilities were substantial  particularly for those reflecting changes in the fair value of bank issued trust preferred securities which we own  including collateralized debt obligations funded by such securities  and the junior subordinated debentures which we have issued 
unfortunately  the market for these securities has been disrupted to the point that there is no meaningful trading activity occurring nor reliable market quotations available 
nonetheless  it is apparent that the values have declined appreciably and our results of operations reflect our best estimates of changes in the value of these assets and liabilities 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to fair value adjustments 
for the year ended december   fair value adjustments were also significantly affected by a reduction in the fair value of our investment in federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac equity securities  which were essentially rendered valueless subsequent to the us treasury s action in september placing those institutions into conservatorship under the authority of the federal housing finance agency 
as of june   we owned both common and preferred equity securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac with a combined book value of million 
at december   the fair value of these securities had declined to approximately  the decrease in the value of these securities was included in the million million after tax net gain in fair value adjustments recorded for the year ended december  see note  fair value accounting and measurement 
we do not anticipate a meaningful recovery with respect to the valuation of the fannie mae and freddie mac stock in future periods 
aside from the level of loan loss provision  fair value adjustments and goodwill write down  our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  consisting of loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  composed primarily of customer deposits and repurchase agreements  fhlb advances  frbsf borrowings and junior subordinated debentures 
net interest income is primarily a function of our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as more fully explained below  our net interest income before provision for loan losses decreased by million for the year ended december  to million as compared to million for the prior year  primarily as a result of a contraction in our net interest margin as asset yields have declined sharply over the past twelve months in response to the federal reserve s action designed to dramatically lower short term interest rates 
further  increased delinquencies and the slowdown in the sale and construction of new homes over the year have had an adverse impact on our net interest margin  as well as on the amount of our loan loss provision 
our net income also is affected by the level of our other operating income  including deposit service charges  loan origination and servicing fees  and gains and losses on the sale of loans and securities  as well as our operating expenses and income tax provisions 
other operating income  excluding the fair value adjustments  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  primarily as a result of increased deposit fees and other service charges reflecting growth in our customer base and related payment processing activities 
revenues net interest income before the provision for loan losses plus other operating income  excluding fair value adjustments  increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  other operating expenses  excluding the million goodwill write off  also increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for prior year 
the increase from the prior year reflects the effects of new branch openings  including two added in and ten added at various times during  as well as last year s three acquisitions which  after consolidations  added another branches and nearly million in total assets 
most significantly  the increase in expenses reflects additional occupancy expense  increased deposit insurance assessments  expanded payment processing activities  costs associated with problem loan collection activities and charges related to real estate owned  offset in part by reductions in advertising and information computer data services 
we offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers  however  we do not now and have not previously engaged in any sub prime lending programs 
historically  our lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
real estate lending activities have been significantly focused on residential construction and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties  however  over the past two years our origination of construction and land development loans has declined materially 
our total construction and land development loan originations in were million  which was approximately lower than in the previous year  and this trend continued as construction and land development loan originations in totaled just million  approximately lower than the prior year 
our real estate lending activities have also included the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
our commercial business lending has been directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agri business borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
we have also increased our emphasis on consumer lending  although the portion of the loan portfolio invested in consumer loans is still relatively small 
while continuing our commitment to residential lending  including our mortgage banking activities  we expect commercial lending including commercial real estate  commercial business and agricultural loans and consumer lending to become increasingly important activities for us 
by contrast  we anticipate residential construction and land development lending will continue to be restrained by market conditions for the next two to three years 
critical accounting policies in the opinion of management  the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition and related consolidated statements of income  comprehensive income  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows reflect all adjustments which include reclassification and normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  management has identified several accounting policies that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
these policies relate to i the methodology for the recognition of interest income  ii determination of the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses  iii the valuation of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and iv the valuation of goodwill 
these policies and judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail below in management s discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time 
however  because of the sensitivity of the financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
further  subsequent changes in economic or market conditions could have a material impact on these estimates and our financial condition and operating results in future periods 
there have been no significant changes in our application of accounting policies since december   except for the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
and discussed below 
for additional information on the adoption of this standard and the valuation of financial assets  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for additional information concerning these critical accounting policies see notes    and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the following interest income notes interest on loans and securities is accrued as earned unless management doubts the collectability of the asset or the unpaid interest 
interest accruals on loans are generally discontinued when loans become days past due for payment of interest and the loans are then placed on nonaccrual status 
all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from interest income upon transfer to nonaccrual status 
for any future payments collected  interest income is recognized only upon management s assessment that there is a strong likelihood that the full amount of a loan will be repaid or recovered 
a loan may be put on nonaccrual status sooner than this policy would dictate if  in management s judgment  the loan may be uncollectible 
while less common  similar interest reversal and nonaccrual treatment would apply to investment securities if their ultimate collectability became questionable 
provision and allowance for loan losses notes the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent in all material respects with the gaap guidelines outlined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we have established systematic methodologies for the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
the methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual problem loans 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for probable loan losses against our income and value impaired loans consistent with the guidelines in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon our continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
realized losses related to specific assets are applied as a reduction of the carrying value of the assets and charged immediately against the allowance for loan loss reserve 
recoveries on previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
the reserve is based upon factors and trends identified by us at the time financial statements are prepared 
although we use the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond our control 
the adequacy of general and specific reserves is based on our continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio  including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience and current economic conditions  as well as individual review of certain large balance loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment include residential real estate and consumer loans and  as appropriate  smaller balance non homogeneous loans 
larger balance non homogeneous residential construction and land  commercial real estate  commercial business loans and unsecured loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  we determine that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  the financial condition of the borrower  the value of the underlying collateral and the current status of the economy 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
subsequent changes in the value of impaired loans are included within the provision for loan losses in the same manner in which impairment initially was recognized or as a reduction in the provision that would otherwise be reported 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances  an allocated formula allowance and an unallocated allowance 
losses on specific loans are provided for when the losses are probable and estimable 
general loan loss reserves are established to provide for inherent loan portfolio risks not specifically provided for 
the level of general reserves is based on analysis of potential exposures existing in our loan portfolio including evaluation of historical trends  current market conditions and other relevant factors identified by us at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans  excluding those loans that are subject to individual analysis for specific allowances 
loss factors are based on our historical loss experience adjusted for significant factors including the experience of other banking organizations that  in our judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the unallocated allowance is based upon our evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
beginning with the year ended december   we adjusted our loss factors in accordance with updated guidance from our regulators 
the adjusted factors resulted in somewhat lower general and specific reserves  however  in the current economic environment  management s judgment with respect to the appropriate level of loss provisioning and allowance resulted in a significantly greater amount of unallocated allowance than in prior periods 
this methodology may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided in the financial statements 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the banks allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
fair value accounting and measurement notes and we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
we include in the notes to the financial consolidated statements information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure financial assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and the impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  for financial instruments not recorded at fair value we disclose  where appropriate  our estimate of their fair value 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell the financial asset or paid to transfer the financial liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date 
sfas no 
 among other things  requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
these two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable 
in accordance with sfaf  it is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
however  in certain instances  when market observable inputs are not available  we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments 
in addition  changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or other observable inputs  requiring a change in the method  judgments and assumptions used to estimate fair value for specific instruments from that which was used in prior periods 
the disruption of certain financial markets and lack of meaningful transaction activity for certain securities in made estimating fair values more difficult and less reliable than in prior years 
goodwill and other intangible assets notes and goodwill and other intangible assets represent the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired by the company 
the excess cost over fair value of net assets acquired consists of goodwill and core deposit premiums 
we account for goodwill and other intangibles as provide for in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the majority of goodwill and intangibles generally arise from business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
goodwill and other intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives generated from purchase business combinations are not subject to amortization and are instead tested for impairment no less than annually 
the goodwill we have recorded has been assigned to our one reporting segment  banking 
annually or more often if appropriate  we engage an independent valuation consultant to assist us in determining whether and to what extent our goodwill asset is impaired 
the gaap standards with respect to goodwill require that we compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill on the company s balance sheet 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the estimated fair value of the company is allocated to all of the company s individual assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  as if the company had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the company is the price paid to acquire it 
the allocation process is performed only for purposes of determining the amount of goodwill impairment  as no assets or liabilities are written up or down  nor are any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets recorded as a part of this process 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment charge which eliminated all of the goodwill previously carried in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
an impairment charge  if necessary  has no effect on the company s or the banks cash balances or liquidity 
in addition  goodwill and core deposit intangibles  net of related deferred income taxes  are not included in regulatory capital for the purpose of calculating the company s or the banks regulatory capital ratios 
adoption and pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements 
eitf implemented a change in accounting principle that required the recognition of a liability and related compensation costs for endorsement split dollar life insurance policies that provide a benefit to an employee that extends to post retirement periods

fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
on january   we adopted fin currently  we are subject to us federal income tax and income tax of the states of idaho and oregon 
the years through remain open to examination for federal income taxes and state income taxes 
as of january  and december   we believe we had insignificant unrecognized tax benefits or uncertain tax positions 
in addition  we have no material accrued interest or penalties as of january  or december  it is our policy to record interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
the amount of interest and penalties for the year ended december  was immaterial 
the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no

the statement specifies under what situations servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be recognized

this statement became effective january  the adoption of the statement has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
comparison of financial condition at december  and general 
total assets increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  net loans receivable gross loans less loans in process  deferred fees and discounts  and allowance for loan losses increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  loan growth was largely due to the growth of million  or  in commercial real estate loans  including construction loans for commercial real estate  million  or  in one to four family residential loans and million  or  in consumer loans 
multifamily  including construction  real estate loans decreased by million  while total commercial and agricultural business loans were essentially unchanged 
we continue to maintain a significant  although decreasing  investment in construction and land loans  however  new production of these types of loans during the past two years has declined appreciably 
as a result of a much slower pace of new originations and continuing payoffs on existing loans  loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential real estate decreased by million  or  since december  by contrast  land and development loans remained relatively unchanged  primarily reflecting a slower pace of sales for these properties than for completed homes 
given the current housing and economic environment and our reduced level of construction and land development loan originations  we anticipate that construction and land loan balances will continue to decline for another four to eight quarters 
securities increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december   as purchases  primarily for liquidity and collateral purposes  exceeded sales and repayments 
effective january   we elected to reclassify most of our securities to fair value following our adoption of sfas no 
although we do not normally engage in trading activities  these securities are reported as trading securities for financial reporting purposes 
at december   the fair value of our trading securities was million less than their amortized cost 
the reduction reflected in the fair value of these securities compared to their amortized cost primarily is due to a net decrease of million in the value of single issuer and pooled trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies and insurance companies as well as a decrease of million in the value of fannie mae and freddie mac common and preferred equity securities  offset by a small gain in all other securities 
see paragraph below and note  fair value accounting and measurement 
real estate owned acquired through foreclosures increased million from million at december  to million at december  this included million in land or land development projects and million in single family homes  primarily from builders new construction inventory 
during the year ended december   we transferred million of loans into real estate owned and sold approximately million of foreclosed properties 
see asset quality discussion below 
deposits increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  non interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million  while interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to billion at december  increasing core deposits is a key element of our expansion strategy  including the recent and planned additions and renovations of branch locations 
unfortunately  during the current year and notwithstanding growth in the number of accounts and customer relationships  growth in aggregate deposit balances was reduced by meaningful decreases in the average account balances of many of our real estate related customers  reflecting the slowdown of home sales and other transaction closings 
we also experienced a significant shift into certificate of deposit accounts as customers repositioned balances to obtain more attractive yields and additional deposit insurance coverage 
certain customers also moved a more significant portion of their funds into retail repurchase agreements to increase their earnings potential and to reduce uninsured deposit balances and benefit from the fully collateralized position that those agreements afford 
as a result  the aggregate total of transaction and savings accounts  including money market accounts  decreased by million  or  to billion  and transaction and savings accounts declined to of total deposits at december   compared to a year earlier 
we also had strong growth in public funds balances which primarily are carried in certificate accounts and an increase of million in brokered certificates of deposit compared to one year ago as we more aggressively utilized these funding sources while paying down borrowings as part of our liquidity management process 
fhlb advances decreased million  excluding fair value adjustments  from million at december   to million at december   while other borrowings increased million to million at december  all of the change in other borrowings reflects an increase in retail repurchase agreements that are primarily related to customer cash management accounts 
junior subordinated debentures decreased by million since december   reflecting the fair value adjustments recorded subsequent to the adoption of sfas  as changes in credit market conditions had a particularly significant impact on the valuation of this type of security 
the change in the fair value of the junior subordinated debentures  while significant  represents a non cash valuation adjustment  had no effect on liquidity or our ability to fund our operations and was substantially offset by similar adjustments to certain investment securities as noted above 
see note  fair value of financial instruments 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares including  shares as consideration for the exercise of stock options of banner corporation common stock for an aggregate price of approximately million  or per share 
all of these purchases were executed in the quarter ended march  in addition  we issued  new shares of common stock for million at an average net per share price of through our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase and sale plan 
we also issued  shares in connection with the exercise of vested stock options and grants 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  our issuance of preferred stock as part of the us treasury s tarp capital purchase program contributed million to our tangible equity 
this stock repurchase and issuance activity  combined with the changes in retained earnings as a result of operations  including the million goodwill impairment charge and net of quarterly dividend distributions  resulted in a net million decrease in stockholders equity 
however  the non cash goodwill impairment charge did not affect tangible equity total stockholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets  which increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the impairment charge also had no effect on the company s or banks regulatory capital ratios see capital requirements 
the capital ratios  however  were significantly strengthened by the issuance of the preferred stock 
book value per common share decreased from at december  to at december   and tangible book value per common share decreased from to  respectively  for the same periods 
investments at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed and mortgage related securities  municipal bonds  and corporate debt obligations 
from time to time  our investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in our loan origination  deposit and other activities 
during the year ended december   investment securities increased by million in response to slowing loan growth coupled with an increasing deposit base and increasing collateral requirements for retail repurchase agreements 
holdings of us treasury and agency obligations increased million  mortgage backed securities increased million and municipal bonds increased million 
corporate and other securities decreased million  largely as a result of recent fair value accounting adjustments for trust preferred securities issued by other financial institutions 
us government and agency obligations our portfolio of us government and agency obligations had a fair value of million million at amortized cost at december   a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
most of the us government and agency obligations we own include call features which allow the issuing agency the right to call the securities at various dates prior to the final maturity 
these securities are primarily pledged as collateral for retail repurchase agreements 
mortgage backed obligations at december   our mortgage backed and mortgage related securities totaled million  or of the consolidated investment portfolio 
included within this amount were collateralized mortgage obligations cmos with a net carrying value of million 
the estimated fair value of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities at december  was million  which is million more than the amortized cost of million 
at december   our portfolio of mortgage backed and mortgage related securities had a weighted average coupon rate of 
at that date  of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities pay interest at a fixed rate and pay at an adjustable interest rate 
the estimated weighted average remaining life of the portfolio was years 
we do not believe that any of our mortgage backed obligations had a meaningful exposure to sub prime mortgages 
municipal bonds our tax exempt municipal bond portfolio at december  totaled million at estimated fair value million at amortized cost  and was comprised of general obligation bonds ie  backed by the general credit of the issuer and revenue bonds ie  backed by revenues from the specific project being financed issued by cities and counties and various housing authorities  and hospital  school  water and sanitation districts located in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  our primary service area 
we also had taxable bonds in our municipal bond portfolio  which at december  totaled million at estimated fair value million at amortized cost 
at december   general obligation bonds and revenue bonds had total estimated fair values of million and million  respectively 
many of our qualifying municipal bonds are not rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency due to the smaller size of the total issuance and a portion of these bonds have been acquired through direct private placement by the issuers 
at december   our municipal bond portfolio had a weighted average maturity of approximately years  an average coupon rate of and an average taxable equivalent yield of 
the largest principal balance of any security in the municipal portfolio was a general obligation bond issued by the public hospital district no 
 columbia and walla walla counties  washington  with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million 
corporate bonds our corporate bond portfolio  which totaled million at fair value million at amortized cost at december   was comprised principally of long term fixed and adjustable rate capital securities issued by financial institutions  including pooled trust preferred securities 
the market for these capital securities deteriorated significantly in and in our opinion is not currently functioning in a meaningful manner 
as a result  the fair value estimates for many of these securities are more subjective than in previous periods 
nonetheless  it is apparent that the values have declined appreciably  which is reflected in our financial statements and results of operations 
in addition to the disruption in the market for these securities  the decline in value also reflects deterioration in the financial condition of some of the issuing financial institutions

loans lending our net loan portfolio increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to an increase of million  or million was added through acquisitions  during the year ended december  and an increase of million  or  in the year ended december  while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
in and the first half of  readily available financing and increasing real estate values led to very strong demand for new real estate loans  including construction loans  however  starting in the summer of  sales of new homes in the markets we serve slowed appreciably  which significantly reduced the demand for new construction and land development loans and slowed our portfolio growth compared to prior years 
by contrast  demand for and our production of commercial business loans strengthened during the second half of however  as progressed very clear signs of accelerating distress in the housing market and decelerating general economic activity led to weakening loan demand  particularly in the quarter ended december  as a result  loan growth slowed considerably in for the years ended december   and  we originated  net of repayments  million  million and million of loans  respectively 
we generally sell a significant portion of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans to secondary market purchasers 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we sell loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
see loan servicing portfolio below 
the decision to hold or sell loans is based on asset liability management goals and policies and market conditions 
loans held for sale increased to million at december   compared to million at december at various times  we also purchase whole loans and participation interests in loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
one to four family residential real estate lending at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we are active originators of one to four family residential loans in communities where we have established offices in washington  oregon and idaho 
despite slowing economic activity  continued in migration and the unprecedented low mortgage interest rate environment in supported demand for residential loans  permitting us to originate a combined total of million of one to four family residential loans for the year ended december  the loan sales noted above  coupled with principal repayments  offset much of the increase from current year origination activity  however  in we had a million increase in the balance of loans on one to four family residences compared to the prior year 
construction and land lending a significant proportion of our loan portfolio consists of residential construction loans to professional home builders  as well as land loans and loans for the construction of commercial and multifamily real estate 
as home sales slowed in the second half of and the housing market weakened even further in  we significantly reduced our origination of new construction and land development loans 
although slower in the fourth quarter of  home sales and restructuring opportunities were sufficient to reduce our portfolio of one to four family construction loans by million compared to the prior year end and by million compared to their peak quarter end balance at june  by contrast  land development loans remained relatively unchanged and we believe they represent the most significant source of risk in our loan portfolio 
at december   construction and land loans totaled billion including million of land or land development loans and million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans  or of total loans  compared to billion  or  at december  construction and land development loan originations totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease compared to million for the year ended december  the geographic distribution of our construction and land development loans is approximately in the greater puget sound market  in the greater portland  oregon market  and in the greater boise  idaho market  with the remaining distributed in various eastern washington  eastern oregon  and northern idaho markets we serve 
increased delinquencies and defaults in residential construction and land development loans had a materially adverse effect on our results of operations for the year ended december   and of our non performing assets at that date resulted from construction and land development lending 
see asset quality 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we also originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no significant concentrations by property type  borrowers or locations 
we experienced reasonable demand for both multifamily and commercial real estate loans in  although primarily in the first six months of the year 
at december   our loan portfolio included million in multifamily and billion in commercial real estate loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans comprised of total loans at december   compared to a year earlier  while combined growth for these loan types was million for the year commercial business lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending 
while continuing and strengthening our commitment to small business lending  we also have experienced officers and staff focused on corporate lending opportunities for borrowers with credit needs generally in a million to million range 
we have leveraged the skills and relationships of these officers with responsive local decision making authority to continue to expand this market niche 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped increase the deposit base 
unfortunately  as economic activity slowed in the second half of the year  demand weakened and commercial business loan growth for the first six months reversed  resulting in a decrease of million  or for the year 
at december   commercial business loans totaled million  or of total loans  compared to million  or  at december  loan terms  including the fixed or adjustable interest rate  the loan maturity and the collateral considerations  vary significantly and are negotiated on an individual loan basis 
agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many washington  oregon and idaho locations in our service area 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we routinely make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operation of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile at times 
generally  in  weather conditions  production levels and market prices were quite good for our agricultural borrowers 
at december   agricultural loans totaled million  or of the loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile loans and loans secured by deposit accounts and  although the balances are not currently significant  in we reintroduced credit card lending to our consumer loan products 
while consumer lending has traditionally been a small part of our business with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base  it has received renewed emphasis in recent years 
this increased effort along with the impact of recent acquisitions has allowed non real estate related consumer loans to increase meaningfully despite continuing high levels of prepayments 
at december   we had million  or of our loans receivable  in non real estate secured consumer loans  which was unchanged compared to december  in addition  consumer loans secured by one to four family real estate  including home equity lines of credit  increased by million to million  or of total loans  at december   compared to million  or  at december  while consumer loans remain a relatively small portion of the loan portfolio  aggregate growth was in and we anticipate increased consumer loan activity in future periods as our branch network and retail customer base continue to grow 
loan servicing portfolio at december   we were servicing million of loans for others  compared to million at december  the loan servicing portfolio at december  included million of freddie mac mortgage loans  million of fannie mae mortgage loans and million of loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington and oregon 
for the year ended december   million of loan servicing fees  net of  of servicing rights amortization  was recognized in operations 
for the prior year  net loan servicing fees were million 
the increased servicing income for the current year primarily reflects an increase loan servicing fees  a greater level of late charge fees and growth through acquisitions 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the cost of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized million   and million  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
msrs generally are adversely affected by current and anticipated prepayments resulting from decreasing interest rates 
at december  and  msrs were carried at a value  net of amortization  of and million  respectively

the average life of loans typically is substantially less than their contractual maturities because of principal repayments and prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on certain mortgage loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decreases when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates

deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
at december   we had billion of deposits  with  or billion  in transaction and savings accounts and  or billion  in time deposits  of which billion had remaining maturities of one year or less 
total deposits increased by million  or  for the year ended december  this includes non interest bearing transaction accounts  which increased by  or million  over the same time period 
as illustrated in the following table  we have added significantly to total transaction accounts demand  now  savings and money market accounts since however  in the current year ended december   total transaction accounts decreased by million  or  as customers average account balances declined and customers repositioned balances to obtain more attractive yields and additional insurance coverage 
by contrast  also as reflected in the table  certificates of deposit have accounted for a somewhat larger percentage of the deposit portfolio than have transaction accounts  and in certificates of deposit increased 
further  although not included in deposit balances  in we had an increase of million  or  in retail repurchase agreements  which are customer funds that are primarily associated with sweep account arrangements tied to transaction accounts 
while increased use of these cash management services has the effect of reducing transaction account balances  it contributes to increased deposit fee revenues 
deposit balances at december  also included million of public funds owned by various counties  municipalities and other public entities predominantly located in washington  oregon and idaho  compared to million at december  growing deposits in general and transaction accounts in particular is a core element of our business plan and is a primary focus of our recent and ongoing branch expansion  relocation and renovation activities 
unfortunately  in as interest rates declined sharply and concerns about the health of the banking industry escalated  changes in both customer and competitor behavior resulted in meaningful shifts in the mix of deposits and at times adverse deposit flows 
while the increase in fdic deposit insurance coverage in the fourth quarter of reduced safety concerns and liquidity pressures  customers remained focused significantly on certificates of deposit in an effort to earn higher yields

to access funds  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb seattle and may apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and securities provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met 
at december   we had million of borrowings from the fhlb seattle at a weighted average rate of  a decrease of million compared to a year earlier

at december   based upon our available unencumbered collateral  banner bank was eligible to borrow million from the frbsf  however  at that date we had no funds borrowed under this arrangement 
we also issue retail repurchase agreements to customers and in the past have borrowed funds through the use of secured wholesale repurchase agreements with securities brokers 
in each case  the repurchase agreements are generally due within days 
at december   retail repurchase agreements totaling million  with a weighted average rate of  were secured by a pledge of certain mortgage backed securities and agency securities with a market value of million 
retail repurchase agreement balances  which are primarily associated with sweep account arrangements  increased by million during  largely as a result of increased use of our cash management services by commercial deposit customers  but also as certain customers transferred uninsured deposits into these collateralized accounts 
we had no outstanding borrowings under wholesale repurchase agreements or our commercial bank credit lines at december  and we have issued an aggregate of million  net of repayments  of trust preferred securities tps since the junior subordinated debentures associated with the tps have been recorded as liabilities on our statement of financial condition  although portions of the tps qualify as tier or tier ii capital for regulatory capital purposes

see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the tps 
asset quality we have always placed a strong emphasis on managing our asset quality by applying a disciplined approach to credit approval and monitoring for signs of deterioration in loan quality 
nonetheless  over the past two years as housing markets have continued to weaken in many of our primary service areas  we have experienced significantly increasing delinquencies and non performing assets  primarily in our construction and land development loan portfolios 
during the third and fourth quarters of  in particular  home and lot sales activity was exceptionally slow  causing additional stress on builders and developers cash flows and ability to service debt  which is reflected in our increased non performing asset totals 
in addition  other non housing related segments of the loan portfolio are beginning to show signs of stress and increasing levels of non performing loans as the effects of the slowing economy are becoming more evident 
as a result  our provision for loan losses was significantly higher in the current year than historical levels and normal expectations 
this higher level of delinquencies and non accruals also had a material adverse effect on operating income as a result of foregone interest revenues and increased loan collection costs 
although much will depend on the depth and duration of the current economic recession  we believe that we can work our way through the housing market related problems and we are actively engaged with our borrowers in resolving problem loans 
while property values have continued to decline  our reserve levels are substantial and  along with our impairment analysis and charge off actions  reflect current appraisals and valuation estimates 
non performing assets increased to million  or of total assets  at december   compared to million  or of total assets  at december  slower sales and excess inventory in certain housing markets have been the primary cause of the increase in delinquencies and foreclosures of residential construction and land development loans  which represent approximately of our non performing assets 
while we have not engaged in any sub prime lending programs and have not been directly impacted by the asset quality issues emanating from that market segment  the effect on home values  housing markets and construction lending from problems associated with sub prime and other non traditional mortgage lending programs has contributed to the increased levels of builder and developer delinquencies 
as a result of this softness in the housing market  we are currently exercising extra monitoring vigilance with respect to our asset quality and for the ended year december   we significantly increased our allowance for loan losses 
while less significant  other non housing related segments of the loan portfolio also experienced increased non performing loans as a result of deteriorating economic conditions and we are proactively monitoring and managing those portions of our portfolio as well 
we continue to believe our level of non performing loans and assets  while increased  is manageable  and we believe that we have sufficient capital and human resources to manage the collection of our one to four family residential construction and related land loan portfolios and other non performing assets in an orderly fashion 
however  our operating results will continue to be adversely impacted until we are able to significantly reduce the level of non performing assets 
while non performing assets are geographically disbursed  they are concentrated largely in land and land development loans 
the primary components of the million in non performing assets are million in non accrual loans  including million of construction and land development loans  and million in real estate owned reo and other repossessed assets 
the geographic distribution of non performing construction  land and land development loans and real estate owned included approximately million  or  in the puget sound region  million  or  in the greater portland market area and million  or  in the greater boise market area 
within our non performing assets  we have a total of non accrual lending relationships  each with aggregate loan exposures in excess of million that collectively comprise million  or of our total non performing assets as of december  the most significant of our non performing loan and reo exposures are included in the following two tables in thousands percent of total non performing assets collateral securing the indebtedness geographic location residential lots homes under construction greater seattle puget sound residential lots nine homes under construction one commercial lot greater portland  or area residential lots greater seattle puget sound residential lots six completed new homes two new homes under construction greater portland  or area residential lots completed new homes greater seattle puget sound residential lots greater portland  or area commercial office building greater portland  or area residential lots one completed new home greater portland  or area undeveloped acres  residential greater boise  id area ten completed new homes seven residential lots greater portland  or area nine residential lots three homes under construction greater portland  or area approx

the second largest element was a residential subdivision with a book value of million secured by fully developed and marketable single family building lots in salem  oregon

real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate held for sale until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lower of its cost the unpaid principal balance of the related loan plus foreclosure costs or net realizable value 
subsequent to foreclosure  the property is carried at the lower of the foreclosed amount or net realizable value 
upon receipt of a new appraisal and market analysis  the carrying value is written down through the establishment of a specific reserve to the anticipated sales price  less selling and holding costs 
at december   we had million of real estate owned 
two large residential subdivisions account for million of that total book value 
the remaining balance consists primarily of single family residential houses throughout washington  oregon and idaho 
these loans are performing under their restructured terms 
in addition to the non performing loans noted in table  as of december   we had loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million with respect to which known information concerning possible credit problems with the borrowers or the cash flows of the properties securing the respective loans has caused management to be concerned about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms 
this may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the nonaccrual loan category

for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  the net loss for the current year reflects material increases in our provision for loan losses as well as a significant decline in our net interest margin  which more than offset the favorable effects of continued growth of loans and deposits  as well as changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
the current year results were also adversely affected by a million non cash impairment charge to eliminate the carrying value of goodwill 
as more fully explained below  our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in the provision for loan losses in the current year primarily reflects an increase in delinquent and non performing construction  land and land development loans for one to four family properties and our concerns that the increasing number of distressed sellers and lender foreclosures may further disrupt certain housing markets and adversely affect home prices and the demand for building lots 
these trends became more apparent as the year progressed  particularly in the puget sound region which had previously shown fewer signs of stress 
our operating results for the year ended december   also included an increase in other operating income  particularly deposit fees and service charges as a result of the increase in our deposit customer base and related payment processing activities 
other operating expenses for the year increased substantially compared to the prior year 
the increase was predominantly due to the write off of million of goodwill 
the increased expense was also representative of a full year s effect of the acquisitions and various new branches  as well as substantially increased deposit insurance and collection and legal costs 
over the past twenty four months through acquisitions and de novo operations  we have added new branches to improve and expand our franchise  impacting both revenues and expenses 
further  our operating results for the year ended december  include a million million after tax net gain as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value pursuant to the adoption of fair value accounting under sfas no 
 compared to a million million after tax gain for the prior year 
the current year fair value adjustment primarily reflects changes in the valuation of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated debentures  both owned and issued by the company  and the reduction in fair value of our investment in fannie mae and freddie mac equity securities 
excluding the net fair value adjustments and goodwill write off  the net loss from core operations was million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  primarily as a result of the decrease in the net interest margin as discussed below and despite the million  or  growth in average interest earning assets compared to the prior year 
the average balance of interest earning assets was billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the prior year 
the net interest margin of for the year ended december  declined basis points from the prior year  largely as a result of the effect of rapidly declining short term interest rates on earning asset yields  particularly floating and adjustable rate loan yields 
by comparison to the prior year  this decline was compounded by the adverse effect of an increase in the level of non accrual loans and other non performing assets 
while funding costs were also significantly lower  the more immediate impact of lower market rates on a substantial portion of our loan portfolio resulted in compression of our net interest margin and more than offset benefits from loan and deposit growth 
reflecting generally lower market interest rates as well as changes in asset mix and a higher level of non accrual loans  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  decreased by basis points compared to the prior year  while funding costs for the same period decreased by only basis points 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest income occurred despite a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  as the growth was more than offset by the basis point decrease in the average yield on those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in the yield on earning assets reflects the significant changes in federal reserve policy actions beginning in september designed to aggressively lower short term interest rates 
as a result of these policy actions  bank prime rates  which had averaged for the year ended december   declined by basis points to average for the year ended december  the prime rate ended the year at  and this change will place further downward pressure on loan yields going forward 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the prior year ended december  interest income on loans for the year decreased by million  or  to million from million for the prior year  reflecting the impact of the basis point decrease in the average yield on loans  which was partially offset by the increase in average loan balances 
the decrease in average loan yields reflects the lower average level of market interest rates in the current year  following the federal reserve s actions to lower those rates  particularly short term interest rates including the prime rate and libor indices which affect the yield on large portions of our construction  land development  commercial and agricultural loans 
the decrease in average loan yields also reflects changes in the mix of the loan portfolio and slower turn over in the construction and land development portfolio which resulted in less recognition of deferred loan fee income  as well as the adverse effect of increased loan delinquencies 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock increased by million  excluding the effect of fair value adjustments for the year ended december   and the interest and dividend income from those investments increased by million compared to the prior year 
the effect of the increased average balance was somewhat enhanced as the average yield on the securities portfolio and cash equivalents increased slightly to for the year ended december   from in the prior year 
the four basis point increase in the yield of the securities portfolio is a reflection of a change in the mix of those assets 
also  while not particularly significant in amount  we received  in dividend income on our fhlb of seattle stock for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to the prior year 
however  in response to the ongoing turmoil in the credit and mortgage markets and the effect on the market value of certain of its mortgage assets  the fhlb of seattle suspended its dividend indefinitely in the fourth quarter of until their earnings and capital position have adequately improved 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the comparable period in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest expense occurred as a result of a basis point decrease in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from for the prior year  and despite a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in interest bearing balances reflects a million increase in average deposits  including growth due to our acquisitions  along with a million increase  excluding the effect of fair value adjustments in average fhlb advances 
the average balances for junior subordinated debentures excluding the effect of fair value adjustments and other borrowings also increased by million compared to a year ago 
the effect of lower average market rates for the year on the cost of these funds was partially mitigated by deposit pricing characteristics noted below and by changes in the mix of deposits 
deposit interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year as a result of a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits and despite the significant deposit growth during the past twelve months 
reflecting the acquisitions  branch expansion and other growth initiatives  average deposit balances increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances decreased from a year ago to for the current year 
deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  however  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits dampen the effect of changes in market rates on our cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing have been evident in the relatively modest decrease in deposit costs as the federal reserve moved aggressively to significantly lower short term interest rates by basis points from september  to december  furthermore  competitive pricing pressure for interest bearing deposits has been quite intense in recent quarters  as many financial institutions until very recently experienced strong loan growth and related funding needs and more recently as certain large financial institutions have experienced increased liquidity strains 
average fhlb advances excluding the effect of fair value adjustments increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million one year earlier 
while the average rate paid on fhlb advances for the year ended december  decreased to  a decrease of basis points compared to the prior year  the million increase in average fhlb borrowings resulted in a million increase in the related interest expense 
junior subordinated debentures which were issued in connection with trust preferred securities had an average balance of million excluding the effect of fair value adjustments and an average cost of for the year ended december  junior subordinated debentures outstanding in the prior year had an average balance of million with a higher average rate of 
generally  the junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three months 
the lower average cost of the junior subordinated debentures in the current year reflects lower short term market interest rates  as well as a lower spread on the most recently issued debentures and the early redemption of a higher costing tranche of debentures 
effective april   we exercised the early redemption provision with respect to approximately million of the junior subordinated debentures which had a spread of to six month libor and an average cost of during the six months preceding redemption 
we replaced the redeemed debentures with a new million tranche of junior subordinated debentures issued on july  with an initial rate of and a repricing spread of to three month libor 
other borrowings consist of retail repurchase agreements with customers  wholesale repurchase agreements with investment banking firms secured by certain investment securities as well as overnight federal funds borrowings from the frbsf and correspondent banks 
the average balance for other borrowings  consisting of million in customer retail repurchase agreements and million of fed funds  was million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the prior year 
the related interest expense for other borrowings decreased by  to million from million for the respective periods  again reflecting significantly lower market interest rates 
the average rate paid on other borrowings was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
other borrowings generally have relatively short terms and therefore reprice to current market levels more quickly than deposits  which generally lag current market rates  although  similar to deposits  customer retail repurchase agreements have a lower degree of volatility than most market rates 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million compared to million from the prior year 
as discussed in the critical accounting policies section above and in note of the selected notes to consolidated financial statements  the provision and allowance for loan losses is one of the most critical accounting estimates included in our consolidated financial statements 
for  the provision for loan losses was the most important factor contributing to our disappointing core operating results 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves  trends in delinquencies and net charge offs 
the significantly greater provision for loan losses for the year ended december  primarily reflects the substantial increase in delinquent and non performing construction  land and land development loans for one to four family properties and our concerns that the increasing number of distressed sellers and lender foreclosures may further disrupt certain housing markets and adversely affect home prices and the demand for building lots 
in particular  the increased provision for loan losses reflects our concern that higher levels of delinquencies and loan loss provisioning recently announced by a number of lenders in our markets could lead to significant additional discounting of property values in efforts to expedite problem loan resolutions 
these concerns heightened during the two most recent quarters as additional evidence of over supply and price declines for certain housing and related lot and land markets became more apparent 
this was particularly the case in certain outlying areas of the puget sound and portland regions  which had previously demonstrated fewer signs of stress than some of the other markets that we serve 
aside from housing related construction and development loans  non performing loans generally reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower  however  more recently the deteriorating pace of economic activity has become a significant contributing factor 
we recorded net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  and non performing loans increased to million at december   compared to million at december  a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and shows an increase of million  to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses increased to at december   compared to at december  the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans decreased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans as defined by sfas no 
of those impaired loans  million have related allowances for credit losses totaling million 
the remaining million in impaired loans have no allowances for credit losses as their estimated collateral value is equal to or exceeds their carrying costs 
impaired loans with related allowances for credit losses that are individually evaluated for reserve needs total million and account for million of the allowances for impaired loans 
impaired loans with related allowances for credit losses that are collectively evaluated as homogeneous pools total million and account for million of the total allowance related to impaired loans 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands table changes in allowance for loan losses years ended december balance  beginning of period allowances added through business combinations provision recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial real estate multifamily real estate construction and land one to four family real estate commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland consumer loans charged off commercial real estate multifamily real estate construction and land one to four family real estate commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland consumer net charge offs balance  end of period allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans net loan charge offs as a percent of average outstanding loans during the period allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated dollars in thousands table allocation of allowance for loan losses at december amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans specific or allocated loss allowances commercial real estate multifamily real estate construction and land one to four family real estate commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland consumer unallocated general loss allowance n a n a n a n a n a total allowance for loan losses we establish specific loss allowances when individual loans are identified that present a possibility of loss ie  that full collectibility is not reasonably assured 
the remainder of the allocated and unallocated allowance for loan losses is established for the purpose of providing for estimated losses which are inherent in the loan portfolio 
other operating income 
other operating income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
deposit fees and other service charge income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  significantly influenced by the increase in deposit balances from our acquisitions  yet also reflecting internally generated growth in customer transaction accounts and increased merchant credit card services 
changes in certain pricing schedules and interchange fees also contributed to the increased fee income 
while deposit fees exhibited solid growth for the full year  the slowing economy did adversely affect our payment processing revenues beginning in the most recent quarter as activity levels for deposit customers  cardholders and merchants clearly declined compared to earlier in the year 
loan servicing fees also increased by  or  to million for the current year  compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting decreased mortgage banking activity  gain on sale of loans decreased by  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the prior year period 
gain on sale of loans in the current year included  of fees on million of loans which were brokered and are not reflected in the volume of loans sold 
by comparison  in the year ended december   gain on sale of loans included  of fees on million of brokered loans 
for the years ended december  and  other income also includes net gains of million and million  respectively  for the change in valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value 
the fair value adjustments in both years primarily reflect changes in the valuation of the junior subordinated debentures we have issued  which resulted in a large gain  partially offset by reductions in the values of the trust preferred securities  including collateralized debt obligations secured by pools of trust preferred securities  and fannie mae and freddie mac equity securities which we own 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
the write off of million of goodwill accounted for of the increase 
the remaining million increase is primarily a result of the recent bank acquisitions and branch expansion evidenced by the increase in compensation  occupancy and miscellaneous expenses as locations  staffing and the volume of activity have expanded 
management has been keenly focused on expense discipline and while we are beginning to experience much of the anticipated efficiencies following last year s acquisitions  the improvement is being significantly offset by increased fdic deposit insurance expense and higher loan collection costs as a result of increased delinquencies 
we also incurred million of costs in connection with operating expenses and valuation adjustments for reo and other repossessed assets  an increase of million in comparison with the prior year 
besides the effect of our three bank acquisitions in  the current year s expenses include operating costs associated with the opening of two new branch offices in in portland  oregon  and bellevue  washington  and ten branches at various times during primarily reflecting these additions  occupancy costs increased by million  or  compared to one year earlier 
in addition  the cost of fdic insurance increased million from a year ago and direct expenses associated with payment and card processing services increased by as a result of growth in these fee generating activities 
the current year s operating expenses also included million for amortization of the core deposit intangibles recorded in connection with three acquisitions  which was an increase of  compared to the year ended december  while we continued our strong commitment to advertising and marketing expenditures  marketing and advertising costs decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
other operating expenses as a percentage of average assets were excluding the goodwill write off for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year  reflecting the increased expenses noted above 
and  while we opened two new offices during the second quarter of  we expect further improvement going forward as we capture additional efficiencies 
our efficiency ratio  adjusted to exclude the fair value adjustments and the goodwill write off  increased to for the year ended december   an increase from in the prior year 
the higher efficiency ratio primarily reflects the adverse effect of a narrower net interest margin on our profitability 
over time  we expect improvement in the ratio of operating expenses to average assets as a result of a more moderate pace of expansion and the maturing of recently opened branches 
further  we believe that this investment in our branch network will lead to a lower relative cost of funds and enhanced revenues over time which  combined with continued expense discipline  should result in an improved efficiency ratio and stronger operating results 
income taxes 
our normal  expected statutory income tax rate is  representing a blend of the statutory federal income tax rate of and apportioned effects of the oregon and idaho income tax rates of and  respectively 
our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in reflects the recording of tax credits related to certain community reinvestment act cra investments combined with the tax benefits of tax exempt income from municipal securities and bank owned life insurance policies 
the effective tax rate in reflects the previously mentioned tax credits and tax exempt income combined with relatively modest amounts of taxable income and  the significant effect of the goodwill write off which is a non deductible expense for tax purposes 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  further  our operating results for the year ended december  included an million million net after tax gain as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value pursuant to the early adoption of fair value accounting under sfas no 
excluding the net fair value adjustments  net income from core operations was million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  there was no similar adjustment for fair value in  however  we did receive a million insurance settlement in excluding that settlement  net income from core operations was million  or per diluted share  in the increased net income from core operations reflected continued growth of loans and deposits  including growth from acquisitions  as well as changes in the mix of those assets and liabilities 
our operating results also included substantial increases in other operating expenses  particularly compensation  occupancy  information services  payment and card processing  amortization of core deposit intangibles  and miscellaneous expenses  reflecting the acquisitions and growth in locations  operations and staff as we continued to expand our franchise 
we added new branches through acquisition during the year ended december   and opened new branches and relocated four others 
in addition to the branches added through acquisition  new or relocated offices that contributed to the higher level of operating expenses during compared to the prior year include boise  meridian and nampa  idaho  baker city  beaverton  la grande  portland and tualatin  oregon  plus bellingham  oak harbor  redmond  federal way  east wenatchee  selah and college place  washington 
operating expense in was also burdened with approximately  of one time costs associated with completing the conversion of the former f m bank branches onto the banner bank data processing platform 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  primarily as a result of the growth in average interest earning assets and despite market pressures on the net interest margin as discussed below 
the net interest margin of for the year ended december  declined nine basis points from the prior year  primarily as a result of the effect of higher deposit costs but also because of the negative effect of non accrual loans on asset yields 
subsequent to the federal reserve s decision to stop increasing short term interest rates after june and as a result of the lag effect on deposit pricing  increases in deposit costs generally exceeded increases in loan yields for the twelve months ended june  further  following the federal reserve s decision to lower interest rates beginning in september  loan yields declined more significantly than deposit costs 
mitigating in part the adverse effects of these market forces on loan and deposit pricing  our average asset mix for the year ended december  reflected proportionately more loans  and fewer investment securities than for the same period a year earlier 
at the same time  our average funding liability base had proportionately more deposits  including more non interest bearing deposits  and proportionately fewer borrowings than in the prior year 
reflecting generally higher market interest rates as well as these mix changes  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  increased by seven basis points compared to the prior year  while funding costs for year ended december  increased by basis points over the same period 
importantly  beginning in september  the federal reserve began aggressively lowering short term interest rates 
the initial effect of lower short term rates was to immediately reduce the yield on a significant portion of our loan portfolio  which  when combined with an increase in non accrual loans  was particularly damaging to our net interest margin in the fourth quarter of similar federal reserve policy actions continued in  leading to further compression of our net interest margin over the course of that year as well 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million one year earlier  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest income occurred as a result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets as well as a seven basis point increase in the average yield on those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the increase in the yield on earning assets was achieved despite modestly lower loan yields as a result of significant growth in loans coupled with a reduction in lower yielding securities balances 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the year ended december  interest income on loans for the year increased by million  or  to million from million for the prior year  reflecting the impact of the increase in average loan balances offset by a five basis point decrease in the average yield on loans 
the decrease in average loan yield reflected the lower average level of market interest rates late in the year  following the federal reserve s actions designed to lower those rates  particularly short term interest rates including the prime rate and libor indices which affect the yield on large portions of our construction  land development  commercial and agricultural loans 
the decrease in average loan yields also reflected changes in the mix of the loan portfolio and slower turn over in the construction and development portfolio which resulted in less recognition of deferred loan fee income  as well as the adverse effect of increased loan delinquencies 
additional factors were changes in the average credit risk profile of new borrowers and competitive pricing pressure which resulted in lower spreads and yields on new loan originations 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock decreased by million for the year ended december   and  as a result  the interest and dividend income from those investments decreased by million compared to the year ended december  the lower average balance was offset to some degree as the average yield on the securities portfolio and cash equivalents increased slightly to for the year ended december   from in the prior year 
we received  in dividend income on our fhlb of seattle stock in  an increase of  compared to the prior year as the fhlb of seattle received approval to resume paying its members cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter of the fhlb of seattle ceased the payment of dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of to improve its capital position 
the fhlb of seattle paid dividends for all of and for the first three quarters of  but elected not to pay a dividend in the fourth quarter of as its capital position was again below the regulatory requirements 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the comparable period in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense reflected a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities  coupled with a basis point increase in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from for the prior year 
the higher interest expense reflected a large increase in average deposits of million  partially offset by a million decrease in fhlb advances  junior subordinated debentures and other borrowings  as well as an overall lower cost of those non deposit funding sources 
the effect of modestly higher average market rates for the year on the cost of these funds was partially mitigated by pricing characteristics noted below and as deposits  including non interest bearing deposits  became a proportionately larger source of funds 
deposit interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year  largely as a result of the significant deposit growth including growth due to our acquisitions  as well as an increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits 
reflecting the acquisitions  branch expansion and other growth initiatives  average deposit balances increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances increased basis points to 
deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  however  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits help mitigate the effect of higher market rates on our cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing were evident in the modest increase in deposit costs as the federal reserve moved to increase short term interest rates by basis points from september to june  and as it decreased short term rates by basis points from september  to december  average fhlb advances decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the prior year  resulting in a million decrease in the related interest expense 
the average rate paid on fhlb advances for the year ended december  decreased to  a decrease of basis points compared to for the year ended december   as we benefited from repaying certain higher cost advances 
junior subordinated debentures had an average balance of million and an average cost of for the year ended december  junior subordinated debentures outstanding in the prior year had an average balance of million with a higher average rate of 
generally  the junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three months 
the lower average cost of the junior subordinated debentures in the current year reflects a lower spread on the most recently issued debentures and the early redemption of a higher costing tranche of debentures  which was partially offset by the effect of increases in short term market interest rates on earlier issues over the first nine months of the year 
other borrowings consist of retail repurchase agreements with customers and reverse repurchase agreements with investment banking firms secured by certain investment securities 
the average balance for other borrowings decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year  while the related interest expense decreased  to million from million for the respective periods 
the average balance of customer retail repurchase agreements increased by million while the average balance of the wholesale borrowings from brokers decreased approximately million 
the average rate paid on other borrowings was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
other borrowings generally have relatively short terms and therefore reprice to current market levels more quickly than deposits and fhlb advances 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million compared to million for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  reflected an increase in delinquencies and non performing loans  balanced against slower growth in the size of the loan portfolio  excluding the effects of the mergers  changes in the loan mix and a modest level of net charge offs 
there were net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to  one year earlier  and non performing loans increased to million at december   compared to million at december  generally  these non performing loans reflected unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower rather than weakness in the overall economy of the pacific northwest  although slower sales in certain housing markets were clearly a significant contributing factor and the greatest increase in delinquencies and non performing loans was centered in construction and land development loans 
a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and shows an increase of million  including million added through the acquisitions  to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses remained unchanged at for both december  and the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans decreased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
as of december   we had indentified million of impaired loans as defined by sfas no 
and had established million of loss allowances related to these loans 
other operating income 
other operating income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  excluding fair value adjustments recorded pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
 core other operating income from core operations increased to million compared to million in the prior year  largely as a result of increased deposit fees and service charges 
deposit fees and other service charge income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   reflecting growth in customer transaction accounts and increased merchant credit card services  largely influenced by the increase in deposit balances from our acquisitions 
changes in certain pricing schedules and interchange fees also contributed to the increased fee income 
loan servicing fees increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of growth in the banks portfolios as well as in the amount of loans serviced for others 
although loan sales declined  gain on sale of loans increased by  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year as the average gain per sale improved from an abnormally low level in the earlier period 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the prior year 
gain on sale of loans in the year ended december  included  of fees on million of loans which were brokered and are not reflected in the volume of loans sold 
by comparison  in the year ended december   gain on sale of loans included  of fees on million of brokered loans 
other income also included a net gain of million for the change in valuation of financial instruments now carried at fair value pursuant to the early adoption of fair value accounting under sfas no 
this gain primarily resulted from changes in the value of the junior subordinated debentures that we have issued  caused by a significant change in the level of credit spreads demanded by buyers of that type of security as reflected in year end market prices for comparable issues 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year  largely reflecting the growth resulting from our branch expansion strategy and the three acquisitions 
other operating expense from core operations  which excludes the insurance recovery  increased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
besides the acquisitions  the increase in expenses included operating costs associated with the opening of twelve new branch offices over the two year period in boise  meridian and nampa  idaho  baker city  beaverton  la grande  portland and tualatin  oregon  and bellingham and oak harbor  washington and the relocation and upgrading of our branch offices in college place  redmond  federal way  east wenatchee and selah  washington 
primarily reflecting the additional branches and bank acquisitions  salary and employee benefits expense increased by million  or  and occupancy costs increased by million  or  compared to the same period a year earlier 
in addition  compensation was higher as a result of general wage and salary increases  as well as increased per employee costs associated with benefit programs and employer paid taxes 
further  direct expenses associated with payment and card processing services increased by million  as a result of growth in these fee generating activities 
we also increased our commitment to advertising and marketing expenditures  which were million in the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
operating expenses for also included million for amortization of the core deposit intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisitions of f m  sjfhc and ncw and approximately  of one time costs associated with completing the conversion of the former f m bank branches onto the banner bank data processing platform 
other operating expenses from core operations including the conversion costs as a percentage of average assets increased to for the year ended december   from one year earlier  reflecting the impact of the acquisitions  integration and conversion costs and continuing startup costs associated with branch growth 
our efficiency ratio  adjusted to exclude fair value adjustments and the insurance recovery  increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million in the prior year 
our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in both periods reflect the recording of tax credits related to certain community reinvestment act cra investments as well as certain tax exempt income 
the slightly lower effective tax rate in primarily reflects the fully tax deductible expense associated with the current year esop contribution  which is in contrast with the prior year when the tax deduction was limited to the cost basis in the shares released

market risk and asset liability management our financial condition and operations are influenced significantly by general economic conditions  including the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received from our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest bearing liabilities 
our activities  like all financial institutions  inherently involve the assumption of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on the institution s earnings and underlying economic value 
interest rate risk is determined by the maturity and repricing characteristics of an institution s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
interest rate risk is measured by the variability of financial performance and economic value resulting from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting our financial performance 
the greatest source of interest rate risk to us results from the mismatch of maturities or repricing intervals for rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
this mismatch or gap is generally characterized by a substantially shorter maturity structure for interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets  although our floating rate assets tend to be more immediately responsive to changes in market rates than most funding deposit liabilities 
additional interest rate risk results from mismatched repricing indices and formulae basis risk and yield curve risk  and product caps and floors and early repayment or withdrawal provisions option risk  which may be contractual or market driven  that are generally more favorable to customers than to us 
an exception to this generalization is the beneficial effect of interest rate floors on a portion of our floating rate loans  which help us maintain higher loan yields in periods when market interest rates decline significantly 
however  in a declining interest rate environment  as loans with floors are repaid they generally are replaced with new loans which have lower interest rate floors 
further  as of december   many of the floating rate loans with interest rate floors are in portions of the portfolio experiencing higher levels of delinquencies  which tends to mitigate the beneficial effect of the floors 
an additional consideration is the lagging and somewhat inelastic pricing adjustments for interest rates on certain deposit products as market interest rates change 
these deposit pricing characteristics are particularly relevant to the administered rates paid on certain checking  savings and money market accounts and contributed to the recent narrowing of our net interest margin following the federal reserve s actions to lower market interest rates beginning in late and accelerating in the first quarter of  as asset yields declined while the reduction in deposit costs lagged 
further  in recent quarters  deposit costs have not declined as much as other short term market interest rates as credit concerns and liquidity issues for certain large financial institutions have created heightened competitive pricing pressures 
as previously noted  our net interest margin has also been adversely affected by an increase in loan delinquencies as well as changes in the portfolio mix as construction and development lending has slowed 
the principal objectives of asset liability management are to evaluate the interest rate risk exposure  to determine the level of risk appropriate given our operating environment  business plan strategies  performance objectives  capital and liquidity constraints  and asset and liability allocation alternatives  and to manage our interest rate risk consistent with regulatory guidelines and policies approved by the board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our earnings and capital position to changes in the level of interest rates 
our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee  which is comprised of members of our senior management 
the committee closely monitors our interest sensitivity exposure  asset and liability allocation decisions  liquidity and capital positions  and local and national economic conditions and attempts to structure the loan and investment portfolios and funding sources to maximize earnings within acceptable risk tolerances 
sensitivity analysis our primary monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is asset liability simulation modeling  which is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  interest rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income resulting from those movements under different rate environments 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in the modeled interest rate environments provides a measurement of interest rate risk 
we also utilize economic value analysis  which addresses changes in estimated net economic value of equity arising from changes in the level of interest rates 
the net economic value of equity is estimated by separately valuing our assets and liabilities under varying interest rate environments 
the extent to which assets gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liability values under the various interest rate assumptions determines the sensitivity of net economic value to changes in interest rates and provides an additional measure of interest rate risk 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis performed by us incorporates beginning of the period rate  balance and maturity data  using various levels of aggregation of that data  as well as certain assumptions concerning the maturity  repricing  amortization and prepayment characteristics of loans and other interest earning assets and the repricing and withdrawal of deposits and other interest bearing liabilities into an asset liability computer simulation model 
we update and prepare simulation modeling at least quarterly for review by senior management and the directors 
we believe the data and assumptions are realistic representations of our portfolio and possible outcomes under the various interest rate scenarios 
nonetheless  the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income and net economic value of equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
tables and a  interest rate risk indicators  set forth as of december  and  the estimated changes in our net interest income over a one year time horizon and the estimated changes in economic value of equity based on the indicated interest rate environments 
note the range of interest rate changes is not identical in table and a as a result of the very low level of interest rates as of december  table interest rate risk indicators dollars in thousands as of december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months economic value of equity table a interest rate risk indicators dollars in thousands as of december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months economic value of equity assumes an instantaneous and sustained uniform change in market interest rates at all maturities 
another although less reliable monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice  based upon certain assumptions  within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
certain shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate coincident with or in advance of changes in market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of some borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a severe change in market interest rates 
tables and a  interest sensitivity gap  present our interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and the tables set forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which are anticipated by us  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future periods shown

although regular savings  demand  now  and money market deposit accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  based on historical experience management considers a substantial amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer maturities 
for the purpose of the gap analysis  these accounts have been assigned decay rates to reflect their longer effective maturities 
if all of these accounts had been assumed to be short term  the one year cumulative gap of interest sensitive assets would have been million  or of total assets at december   and million  or  at december  interest bearing liabilities for this table exclude certain non interest bearing deposits that are included in the average balance calculations reflected in table  analysis of net interest spread 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  proceeds from loan principal and interest payments and sales of loans  and the maturity of and interest income on mortgage backed and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our primary investing activity is the origination and purchase of loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased loans of million  million and million  respectively  while loan originations  net of repayments  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
this activity was funded primarily by principal repayments on loans and securities  sales of loans  and deposit growth 
during the years ended december   and  we sold million  million and million  respectively  of loans 
net deposit growth was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  with million of the growth coming from acquisitions 
deposit activity in included net increases of million and million of brokered deposits and public funds 
during  brokered deposits decreased by million while public funds increased by million 
brokered deposits and public funds are generally more price sensitive than retail deposits and our use of those deposits varies significantly based upon our liquidity management strategies at any point in time 
fhlb advances excluding fair value adjustments decreased million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other borrowings  including junior subordinated debentures excluding fair value adjustments  increased million for the year ended december   decreased million for the year ended december   and increased million for the year ended december  we must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to accommodate deposit withdrawals  to support loan growth  to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
during the years ended december   and  we used our sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments  to purchase securities  and to pay maturing savings certificates and deposit withdrawals 
in we also used approximately million to fund the cash portion of the purchase price and acquisition costs of our three acquisitions 
at december   we had outstanding loan commitments totaling billion  including undisbursed loans in process and unused credit lines totaling billion 
while reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and lending activities  this level of commitments is proportionally consistent with our historical experience and does not represent a departure from normal operations 
we generally maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities to meet short term liquidity needs  however  our primary liquidity management practice is to increase or decrease short term borrowings  including fhlb advances and frbsf borrowings 
we maintain credit facilities with the fhlb seattle  which at december  provide for advances that in the aggregate may equal the lesser of of banner bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral  up to a total possible credit line of million  and of islanders bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral  up to a total possible credit line of million 
advances under this credit facility totaled million  or of our assets at december  in addition  banner bank has been approved for participation in the federal reserve bank of san francisco s borrower for custody bic program 
under this program we can borrow up to of eligible loans not already pledged for other borrowings  which we currently estimate would provide additional borrowing capacity of million 
we utilized this facility on a limited basis during  however  we had no funds borrowed from the federal reserve bank at december  at december   certificates of deposit amounted to billion  or of our total deposits  including billion which were scheduled to mature within one year 
while no assurance can be given as to future periods  historically  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our deposits as they mature 
management believes it has adequate resources and funding potential to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements 
capital requirements banner corporation is a bank holding company registered with the federal reserve 
bank holding companies are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of  as amended bhca  and the regulations of the federal reserve 
banner bank and islanders bank  as state chartered  federally insured commercial banks  are subject to the capital requirements established by the fdic 
the capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require banner corporation and the banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital 
the federal reserve requires banner corporation to maintain capital adequacy that generally parallels the fdic requirements 
the fdic requires the banks to maintain minimum ratios of tier total capital to risk weighted assets as well as tier leverage capital to average assets

the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
