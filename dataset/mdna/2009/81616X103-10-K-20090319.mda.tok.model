we had outstanding borrowings of million and million  under the credit facility as of january   and december   respectively 
we also had outstanding letters of credit of million and zero as of january   and december   respectively 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the amounts available under the credit facility 
at january   and december   million and million  respectively  were available under this credit facility 
in early march  we received a federal income tax refund of approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  these funds have been placed in a cash collateral account with the lenders 
we are in discussions with the lenders regarding the potential use or application of these funds to address our near term liquidity needs 
at january   borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at a floating rate and could be maintained as base rate loans tied to the prime rate  plus a margin of up to or the federal funds rate plus or as eurocurrency rate loans tied to libor  plus a margin up to depending on our leverage ratio  as defined

any amendment of the credit agreement may significantly increase the cost of credit provided under the credit facility and related expenses  which may adversely impact our profitability 
whether or not we obtain an amendment of the credit agreement  we may need to or choose to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
the issuance of any additional debt securities could materially and adversely impact our profitability and financial condition 
the issuance of additional equity securities could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may not be able to fund our operating needs and we could face a risk of default under our credit agreement 
a default under the credit agreement would enable the lenders to seek immediate payment in full of any amounts outstanding under the credit facility and to exercise various remedies as secured creditors  which may severely or completely constrain our ability to continue to operate our business as a going concern and may require us to seek protection from creditors through bankruptcy proceedings 
our uncertain financial position may also disrupt relationships with our suppliers 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
