a failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical care costs may negatively impact our results of operations 
because of the time lag between when medical services are actually rendered by our providers and when we receive  process  and pay a claim for those medical services  we must continually estimate our medical claims liability at particular points in time  and establish claims reserves related to such estimates 
our estimated reserves for such incurred but not paid  or ibnp medical care costs  are based on numerous assumptions 
we estimate our medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based on historical data adjusted for claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our ability to accurately estimate claims for our newer health plans in florida and missouri is impacted by the more limited claims payment history of those health plans 
likewise  our ability to accurately estimate claims for our newer lines of business or populations  such as with respect to medicare advantage or aged  blind or disabled medicaid members  is impacted by the more limited experience we have had with those populations 
finally  with regard to the new medicaid and chip members we expect to enroll in through organic growth due primarily to the recession  new members may be disproportionately costly due to high utilization in their first several months of medicaid or chip membership as a result of their previously having been uninsured and therefore not seeking or deferring medical treatment 
the ibnr estimation methods we use and the resulting reserves that we establish are reviewed and updated  and adjustments  if deemed necessary  are reflected in the current period 
given the numerous uncertainties inherent in such estimates  our actual claims liabilities for a particular quarter or other period could differ significantly from the amounts estimated and reserved for that quarter or period 
our actual claims liabilities have varied and will continue to vary from our estimates  particularly in times of significant changes in utilization  medical cost trends  and populations and markets served 
if our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated  our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period could be negatively affected 
our estimates of ibnp may be inadequate in the future  which would negatively affect our results of operations for the relevant time period 
furthermore  if we are unable to accurately estimate ibnp  our ability to take timely corrective actions may be limited  further exacerbating the extent of the negative impact on our results

table of contents the recession and resulting pressures on state budgets may result in funding for medicaid or chip that does not keep pace with the growth in member enrollment 
as a result of the current recession and rising unemployment levels  overall medicaid enrollment and medicaid costs are projected to increase in in addition  the federal government recently approved a significant expansion of the chip program  which should lead to increased chip enrollment and costs 
however  most state governments are currently facing significant budget shortfalls for their and fiscal years 
these budget pressures have already caused many states to cut their spending  to tap into their budget reserves  and to seek to raise revenues in order to balance their budgets 
because governmental health care programs account for such a large portion of state budgets  efforts to contain overall government spending and to achieve a balanced budget often result in significant political pressure being directed at the funding for these health care programs 
with the exception of the relatively small portion of our revenues which come from medicare  nearly all of our premium revenues are derived from the joint federal and state funding of the medicaid and chip programs 
thus  the completeness of the funding under our various state contracts  or the rate increases we expect to receive during the course of a year  can be jeopardized during times of state budget crises 
all of the states in which we currently operate our health plans with the sole exception of texas are currently facing significant budgetary pressures 
in recognition of this problem and to help ease the pressure caused by shortfalls in state budgets  the federal government enacted on february  the american recovery and reinvestment act of as part of this legislation  the federal government increased the amount of funding for federal medicaid matching by approximately billion for the period between october  and december  the actual matching percentage is computed from a formula that takes into account the average per capita income for each state relative to the national average  and a state s unemployment rate 
as a result of the passage of this legislation  the share of medicaid costs that are paid for by the federal government will go up  and the share of costs that are paid for by the states will go down 
however  in order for states to receive these increased federal matching funds  they must first budget for and actually spend their own state dollars to cover their additional medicaid and chip members 
medicaid spending will therefore be driven by states available revenues 
state governments may have insufficient funds in order to fully fund these programs or provide for expanded enrollment 
as a result  states may seek to cut or revise health care programs  optional benefits  eligibility criteria  or provider rates  causing the funding of one or more of our state contracts to be curtailed or cut off 
in addition  the timing of payments we receive may be impacted by state budget shortfalls 
as an example  during some monthly payments made by the state of california to our california health plan were several months late  which may occur again during any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
there are numerous risks associated with the growth and operation of our ohio health plan 
membership at our ohio health plan has grown rapidly  and the medical care ratio of our ohio health plan has been substantially higher than that historically experienced by the company as a whole 
at the beginning of  we had projected that the medical care ratio of our ohio plan would be for the full year 
the actual medical care ratio of our ohio health plan for full year was 
for full year  as the result of risk adjustment payments we expect to receive with respect to our ohio abd members  the expected benefits from our in sourcing of behavioral health  and the expected savings derived from our provider re contracting efforts  we have projected that we can lower the medical care ratio of our ohio health plan to approximately 
in the event these efforts are unsuccessful  the predicted savings are not realized  or we are otherwise unable to lower the medical care ratio of our ohio health plan  the higher than expected medical care ratio of that plan could negatively impact the financial performance of the company as a whole 
in addition  the lower amount of experience of our ohio medicaid and abd members in accessing managed care and of our local providers in coordinating managed care services for their patients may also contribute to a higher than average medical care ratio 
further  as our ohio plan continues to grow  we will be required to increase the amount of regulatory capital we contribute to it 
in  we were required to contribute million in additional regulatory capital to our ohio plan 
if we are required to contribute additional capital in the future  our 
table of contents existing cash balances or cash from operations may not be sufficient to cover such payments  in which case we would be required to draw down on our credit facility or obtain additional financing from another source and thereby incur additional indebtedness 
in the event we are unable to lower our medical care ratio in ohio  or if the ohio plan requires a disproportionate investment of corporate resources or is otherwise unsuccessful  the poor performance of that health plan could detrimentally impact the financial performance of the company as a whole 
if our government contracts are not renewed or are terminated  or if the responsive bids of our health plans for new medicaid contracts are not successful  including the bids of our michigan and missouri health plans  our premium revenues could be materially reduced and our operating results could be negatively impacted 
our government contracts generally run for periods of one year to four years  and may be successively extended by amendment for additional periods if the relevant state agency so elects 
our current contracts expire on various dates over the next several years 
there is no guarantee that any of our government contracts will be renewed or extended 
moreover  our contracts may be subject to periodic competitive bidding 
as an example  the medicaid contracts of our michigan and missouri health plans both expire on september  these health plans will be required to submit bids in response to the requests for proposals of the medicaid authorities in each of michigan and missouri 
in the event the responsive bids of our health plans are not successful  we will lose our medicaid contract in the applicable state  and our premium revenues could be materially reduced as a result 
alternatively  even if our responsive bids are successful  they may be based upon assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  medical costs  or other factors which could result in the medicaid contract being less profitable than we had expected or had previously been the case 
in addition  all of our contracts may be terminated for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations 
our contracts with the states are also subject to cancellation by the state in the event of unavailability of state or federal funding 
in some jurisdictions  such cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
in addition  most contracts are terminable without cause 
we may face increased competition as other plans  many with greater financial resources and greater name recognition  attempt to enter our markets through the contracting process 
if we are unable to renew  successfully re bid  or compete for any of our government contracts  or if any of our contracts are terminated or renewed on less favorable terms  our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations could be adversely affected 
we derive our premium revenues from a relatively small number of state health plans 
we currently derive our premium revenues from ten state health plans 
if we were unable to continue to operate in any of those ten states and in particular in the plans we operate in the states of washington  ohio  michigan  california  or new mexico or if our current operations in any portion of the states we are in were significantly curtailed  our revenues could decrease materially 
our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on significant rate reductions  a loss of a material contract  legislative actions  changes in medicaid eligibility methodologies  catastrophic claims  an epidemic or an unexpected increase in utilization  general economic conditions  and similar factors in those states 
our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we currently operate  or a significant change in the nature of our existing operations  could adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
portions of our premium revenue are subject to accounting estimates or retroactive adjustment 
certain elements of the premium revenue earned by our new mexico  ohio  texas  and utah health plans  and by our medicare advantage plans  are subject to accounting estimates 
such estimates may subsequently prove to be inaccurate or may require adjustment based upon factual developments 
if our accounting estimates with respect to our anticipated premiums are inaccurate or previously recognized premiums require retroactive adjustment  the change in our revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
for additional information regarding this risk  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue 

table of contents our business may be negatively affected by major governmental health care reform proposals 
in response to dramatically escalating health care costs and the large and growing number of uninsured americans  legislative proposals that would reform the health care system have been advanced by congress and state legislatures and are currently pending at the federal and state levels 
these changes include policy changes that would fundamentally change the dynamics of the health care industry  such as having the federal government assume a larger role in the health care industry  or effecting a fundamental restructuring of the medicare or medicaid programs 
these proposals may also affect certain aspects of our business  including contracting with providers  provider reimbursement methods and payment rates  coverage determinations  mandated benefits  minimum medical expenditures  claims payment and processing  drug utilization and patient safety efforts  collection  use  disclosure  maintenance  and disposal of individually identifiable health information or personal health records 
we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law  or  if enacted  what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be  but their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 
in addition  our operating results could be adversely affected by such changes even if we correctly predict their occurrence 
in the event the grandfathering of the medicaid managed care organization provider tax in the states of california  missouri  and ohio is not extended past september  or replacement state programs are not enacted  the medicaid funds available for managed care organization in those states  including for our health plans  could be materially reduced 
section w of the social security act permits states to receive federal matching medicaid funds for revenues collected through health care related taxes 
some states use these taxes to fund increased payment rates to providers  thereby effectively increasing the state s federal matching rates 
the statute defines the term tax to include any licensing fee  assessment  or other payment mandated by the state 
prior to the enactment of the deficit reduction act of the deficit reduction act  the law had permitted a state to define the class of items provided by managed care organizations to mean only revenues received for medicaid services 
however  the deficit reduction act effectively eliminated the future use of such a tax by requiring states to apply the tax broadly to revenue received by health plans for all services provided  including services provided by commercial health plans to commercial health plan members 
but for eight states that previously had had managed care organization provider taxes in place targeting only medicaid health plan services  the deficit reduction act delayed the effective date of this change to october  included among those eight grandfathered states were four states in which we currently operate health plans california  michigan  missouri  and ohio 
since the adoption of the deficit reduction act  those four states have continued to collect a provider tax on medicaid managed care organizations  which has resulted in additional federal medicaid matching funds being available in those states for distribution to medicaid managed care organizations 
these states depend upon revenues raised through their medicaid managed care organization provider tax to help them fund their medicaid programs 
the affected states are now considering how to comply with the expiration of the deficit reduction act grandfather clause on september  one option would be for them to eliminate the managed care organization provider tax and replace the lost funds with increases in other medicaid provider taxes 
another option would be to modify the existing managed care organization provider tax to meet the requirements for a broad based tax that is imposed on both medicaid and non medicaid covered services 
one of the affected states michigan has recently enacted a law which  effective as of april   repeals the existing managed care organization provider tax and introduces a new use tax on entities that have a contract to provide medicaid services  thus effectively resolving the issue in that state 
in the event congress does not further grandfather the medicaid managed care organization provider tax in the states of california  missouri  and ohio to support their medicaid programs  or if local state programs are not adopted in its place  the loss of state and federal matching medicaid funds in those states starting in october could materially reduce the revenues of our california  missouri  and ohio health plans  thereby negatively affecting our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 

table of contents a sustained drop in the rate of interest earned on our invested balances could adversely affect our revenues 
our revenues from invested balances in were million  whereas our revenues from invested balances in were million 
if the rate of return on our invested balances in had matched the rate of return experienced in  our year over year earnings would have increased by rather than the increase actually experienced 
thus  prevailing interest rates during the year can have a significant impact on our revenues and earnings 
we have projected that  on average in fiscal year  our invested balances will earn interest at the rate of at least 
our invested balances earned an average of in in the event the interest earned on our invested balances throughout averages less than per annum  our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to achieve our projected growth in medicare members or our projected medical care ratio with respect to our medicare program  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our business strategy includes increasing enrollment for our members who are dually eligible under both the medicaid and medicare programs  as well as increasing the number of our members eligible under medicare alone 
our experience with the medicare program and with medicare members is much more limited than our experience with medicaid 
the administrative processes  programmatic requirements  and regulations pertaining to the medicare program differ significantly from those of the medicaid program 
likewise  the medicare population has many characteristics and behavior patterns which differ from the medicaid population with which we are familiar 
finally  medicare providers  provider networks  and provider relations also differ from those of medicaid 
during  we intend to continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary to grow our medicare program 
we have projected that we will have enrolled  medicare members by the end of in the event we are unable to enroll as many medicare members as we project or if we are unable to quickly develop our medicare expertise and adapt to the differing requirements and needs of the medicare program and medicare members  our business strategy may be unsuccessful and our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations could be adversely affected 
failure to attain profitability in any new start up operations could negatively affect our results of operations 
start up costs associated with a new business can be substantial 
for example  to obtain a certificate of authority to operate as a health maintenance organization in most jurisdictions  we must first establish a provider network  have infrastructure and required systems in place  and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims 
often we are also required to contribute significant capital to fund mandated net worth requirements  performance bonds or escrows  or contingency guaranties 
if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the certificate of authority  winning the bid to provide services  or attracting members in sufficient numbers to cover our costs  any new business of ours would fail 
we also could be required by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or to recover our significant start up costs 
even if we are successful in establishing a profitable health plan in a new state  increasing membership  revenues  and medical costs will trigger increased mandated net worth requirements which could substantially exceed the net income generated by the health plan 
rapid growth in an existing state will also create increased net worth requirements 
in such circumstances we may not be able to fund on a timely basis or at all the increased net worth requirements with our available cash resources 
the expenses associated with starting up a health plan in a new state or expanding a health plan in an existing state could have a significant adverse impact on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 
the acquisitions of other health plans and the assignment and assumption of medicaid contract rights of other health plans have accounted for a significant amount of our growth over the last several years 
although we cannot predict with certainty our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions  we believe that additional acquisitions of all sizes will be important to our future growth strategy 
many of the other potential purchasers of these assets 
table of contents particularly operators of large commercial health plans have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
also  many of the sellers may insist on selling assets that we do not want  such as commercial lines of business  or may insist on transferring their liabilities to us as part of the sale of their companies or assets 
even if we identify suitable targets  we may be unable to complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us or obtain the necessary financing for these acquisitions 
further  to the extent we complete an acquisition  we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisition because of operational factors or difficulty in integrating the acquisition with our existing business 
this may include problems involving the integration of additional employees who are not familiar with our operations or our corporate culture  new provider networks which may operate on terms different from our existing networks  additional members who may decide to transfer to other health care providers or health plans  disparate information  claims processing  and record keeping systems  internal controls and accounting policies  including those which require the exercise of judgment and complex estimation processes  such as estimates of claims incurred but not reported  accounting for goodwill  intangible assets  stock based compensation  and income tax matters  and new regulatory schemes  relationships  practices  and compliance requirements 
also  we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions 
in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not already operate  we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state 
in addition  although we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business  we would be required to obtain regulatory approval if  as a result of the acquisition  we will operate in an area of that state in which we did not operate previously 
we may be unable to obtain the necessary governmental approvals or comply with these regulatory requirements in a timely manner  if at all 
for all of the above reasons  we may not be able to consummate our proposed acquisitions as announced from time to time to sustain our pattern of growth or to realize benefits from completed acquisitions 
restrictions and covenants in our credit facility may limit our ability to make certain acquisitions or reduce our liquidity and capital resources 
to provide liquidity  we have a million senior secured credit facility that matures in may as of december   we had no outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
our credit facility imposes numerous restrictions and covenants  including prescribed consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  net worth requirements  and acquisition limitations that restrict our financial and operating flexibility  including our ability to make certain acquisitions above specified values and declare dividends without lender approval 
as a result of the restrictions and covenants imposed under our credit facility  our growth strategy may be negatively impacted by our inability to act with complete flexibility  or our inability to use our credit facility in the manner intended 
if we are in default at a time when funds under the credit facility are required to finance an acquisition  or if a proposed acquisition does not satisfy the pro forma financial requirements under our credit facility  we may be unable to use the credit facility in the manner intended 
in addition  if we were to draw down on our credit facility  or incur other additional debt in the future  it could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  and other general operating requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

table of contents in addition  the financial institutions which form the lending syndicate under our credit facility have recently experienced significant losses 
as a result  such financial institutions may be unable to fund a loan under our credit facility 
in the event we default under our credit facility or our lenders are unable to fund a loan request under our credit facility  our operations  liquidity  and capital resources could be materially adversely affected 
adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse affect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 
the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past year 
the availability of credit  from virtually all types of lenders  has been severely restricted 
such conditions may persist throughout and beyond 
in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses  make payments on our indebtedness  pay capital expenditures  or fund acquisitions  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant  particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  and perceptions of our financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
while we have not attempted to access the credit markets recently  we believe that if credit could be obtained  the terms and costs of such credit would be significantly less favorable to us than what was obtained in our most recent financings 
ineffective management of our growth may negatively affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
depending on acquisitions and other opportunities  we expect to continue to grow our membership and to expand into other markets 
in fiscal year  we had total premium revenue of billion 
in fiscal year  we had total premium revenue of billion  an increase of over a four year span 
continued rapid growth could place a significant strain on our management and on other company resources 
our ability to manage our growth may depend on our ability to strengthen our management team and attract  train  and retain skilled employees  and our ability to implement and improve operational  financial  and management information systems on a timely basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  due to the initial substantial costs related to acquisitions  rapid growth could adversely affect our short term profitability and liquidity 
any changes to the laws and regulations governing our business  or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations  could cause us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results 
our business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate 
the laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than managed care organizations 
the government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude in interpreting and applying them 
these laws and regulations  along with the terms of our government contracts  regulate how we do business  what services we offer  and how we interact with members and the public 
for instance  some states mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues 
these laws and regulations  and their interpretations  are subject to frequent change 
the interpretation of certain contract provisions by our governmental regulators may also change 
changes in existing laws or regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or regulations  could reduce our profitability by imposing additional capital requirements  increasing our liability  increasing our administrative and other costs  increasing mandated benefits  forcing us to restructure our relationships with providers  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
changes in the interpretation of our contracts could also reduce our profitability if we have detrimentally relied on a prior interpretation 

table of contents funding under our contracts is subject to regulatory and programmatic adjustments and reforms for which we may not be appropriately compensated 
the federal government and the governments of the states in which we operate frequently consider legislative and regulatory proposals regarding medicaid reform and programmatic changes 
such proposals involve  among other things  changes in reimbursement or payment levels based on certain parameters or member characteristics  changes in eligibility for medicaid  and changes in benefits covered such as pharmacy  behavioral health  or vision 
any of these changes could be made effective retroactively 
if our cost increases resulting from these changes are not matched by commensurate increases in our revenue  we would be unable to make offsetting adjustments  such as supplemental premiums or changes in our benefit plans  as would a commercial health plan 
any such regulatory or programmatic reforms at either the federal or state level could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
we face periodic routine and non routine reviews  audits  and investigations by government agencies  and these reviews and audits could have adverse findings  which could negatively impact our business 
we are subject to various routine and non routine governmental reviews  audits  and investigations 
violation of the laws  regulations  or contract provisions governing our operations  or changes in interpretations of those laws  could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  the cancellation of our contracts to provide managed care services  the suspension or revocation of our licenses  the exclusion from participation in government sponsored health programs  or the revision and recoupment of past payments made based on audit findings 
if we become subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions were imposed upon us  we might suffer a substantial reduction in profitability  and might also lose one or more of our government contracts and as a result lose significant numbers of members and amounts of revenue 
in addition  government receivables are subject to government audit and negotiation  and government contracts are vulnerable to disagreements with the government 
for instance  cms announced in that it will perform audits of selected medicare health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by care providers 
these audits involve a review of medical records maintained by providers  including those in and out of network  and may result in retrospective or prospective adjustments to payments made to health plans pursuant to cms medicare contracts 
the final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be different from the amounts we initially recognize in our financial statements 
our business depends on our information and medical management systems  and our inability to effectively integrate  manage  and keep secure our information and medical management systems  or to successfully migrate our main data processing facility to the new facility we are constructing in new mexico  could disrupt our operations 
our business is dependent on effective and secure information systems that assist us in  among other things  processing provider claims  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  supporting our medical management techniques  and providing data to our regulators 
our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications  claims status  and other information 
if we experience a reduction in the performance  reliability  or availability of our information and medical management systems  our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected 
in addition  if the licensor or vendor of any software which is integral to our operations were to become insolvent or otherwise fail to support the software sufficiently  our operations could be negatively affected 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading  and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
our policy is to upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly implement  maintain  upgrade or expand our system  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  loss of members  difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems  and increases in administrative expenses 
we are currently constructing a new health information technology center in albuquerque  new mexico 
during  we anticipate migrating our main data processing functions from our current facility in long beach  
table of contents california to that new facility 
in the event that transition to new mexico is disrupted for any reason  or if the information technology equipment in our new facility malfunctions  our claims processing  utilization management  or other data processing functions could be disrupted which would adversely affect all of our business operations 
in addition  we intend during to migrate the claims processing functions of our missouri health plan to our centralized platform 
in the event that migration is unsuccessful  the business operations of our missouri health plan could be adversely affected 
our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and member data stored in our information systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems  or those of our providers or regulators  which could disrupt our operations  or make our systems inaccessible to our members  providers  or regulators 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation  possible liability and loss 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of members if they are not prevented 
because our corporate headquarters are located in southern california  our business operations may be significantly disrupted as a result of a major earthquake 
our corporate headquarters is located in long beach  california 
in addition  until our centralized claims processing and information technology support functions are migrated to new mexico  those facilities will remain in long beach  california 
southern california is exposed to a statistically greater risk of a major earthquake than most other parts of the country 
if a major earthquake were to strike the los angeles and long beach area  our corporate functions and claims processing could be significantly impaired for a substantial period of time 
although we have established a disaster recovery and business resumption plan with back up operating sites to be deployed in the case of such a major disruptive event  there can be no assurances that the business operations of all our health plans  including those that are remote from any such event  would not be substantially impacted by a major southern california earthquake 
if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals  and other providers with whom we contract  or if we are unable to enter into cost effective contracts with such providers  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  and other providers as a means to assure access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization  and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments  or take other actions which could result in higher health care costs  disruption to provider access for current members  a decline in our growth rate  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations  and some specialists  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts which are disadvantageous to us  our profitability in those areas could be adversely affected 
some providers that render services to our members are not contracted with our plans 
in those cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and our plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider 
in some states  the amount of compensation is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms 
in such instances  providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with our 
table of contents plan 
the uncertainty of the amount to pay and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of the payment could adversely affect our business  financial position  cash flows  or results of operations 
regulatory actions and negative publicity regarding medicaid managed care and medicare advantage may lead to programmatic changes and intensified regulatory scrutiny and regulatory burdens 
several of our health care competitors have recently been involved in governmental investigations and regulatory actions which have resulted in significant volatility in the price of their stock 
in addition  there has been negative publicity and proposed programmatic changes regarding medicare advantage private fee for service plans  a part of the medicare advantage program in which the company does not participate 
because of the limited number of health care companies competing in our market space  these actions and the resulting negative publicity could become associated with or imputed to the company  regardless of the company s actual regulatory compliance or programmatic participation 
such an association  as well as any perception of a recurring pattern of abuse among the health plan participants in government programs and the diminished reputation of the managed care sector as a whole  could result in public distrust  political pressure for changes in the programs in which the company does participate  intensified scrutiny by regulators  additional regulatory requirements and burdens  increased stock volatility due to speculative trading  and heightened barriers to new managed care markets and contracts  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
if a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied  our membership in that state will likely decrease 
states may only mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care under federal waivers or demonstrations 
waivers and programs under demonstrations are approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state does not renew its mandated program or the federal government denies the state s application for renewal  our business would suffer as a result of a likely decrease in membership 
we face claims related to litigation which could result in substantial monetary damages 
we are subject to a variety of legal actions  including medical malpractice actions  provider disputes  employment related disputes  and breach of contract actions 
in the event we incur liability materially in excess of the amount for which we have insurance coverage  our profitability would suffer 
in addition  our providers involved in medical care decisions are exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
providers at the primary care clinics we operate in california are employees of our california health plan 
as a direct employer of physicians and ancillary medical personnel and as an operator of primary care clinics  our california plan is subject to liability for negligent acts  omissions  or injuries occurring at one of its clinics or caused by one of its employees 
we maintain medical malpractice insurance for our clinics in the amount of million per occurrence  and an annual aggregate limit of million  errors and omissions insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and in aggregate for each policy year  and such other lines of coverage as we believe are reasonable in light of our experience to date 
however  given the significant amount of some medical malpractice awards and settlements  this insurance may not be sufficient or available at a reasonable cost to protect us from damage awards or other liabilities 
even if any claims brought against us were unsuccessful or without merit  we would have to defend ourselves against such claims 
the defense of any such actions may be time consuming and costly  and may distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business 
furthermore  claimants often sue managed care organizations for improper denials of or delays in care  and in some instances improper authorizations of care 
also  congress and several state legislatures have considered legislation that would permit managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
if this or similar legislation were enacted  claims of this nature could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable medical malpractice insurance coverage 
successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers  or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability 

table of contents we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty 
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation  other such liabilities may not be covered by insurance  the insurers could dispute coverage  or the amount of insurance could be insufficient to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level which would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
although we establish reserves for litigation as we believe appropriate  we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover such costs 
therefore  the litigation to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations  and could prompt us to change our operating procedures 
we are subject to competition which negatively impacts our ability to increase penetration in the markets we serve 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size  location  and quality of provider network  benefits supplied  quality of service  and reputation 
a number of these competitive elements are partially dependent upon and can be positively affected by the financial resources available to a health plan 
many other organizations with which we compete  including large commercial plans  have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
for these reasons  we may be unable to grow our membership  or may lose members to other health plans 
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries  it may negatively affect our business strategy 
we are a corporate parent holding company and hold most of our assets at  and conduct most of our operations through  direct and indirect subsidiaries 
as a holding company  our results of operations depend on the results of operations of our subsidiaries 
moreover  we are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and restrictions contained in agreements governing the debt of such subsidiaries 
in addition  our health plan subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that they can pay to us without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
in california  our health plan may dividend  without notice to or approval of the california department of managed health care  amounts by which its tangible net equity exceeds of the tangible net equity requirement 
our other health plans must give thirty days advance notice and the opportunity to disapprove extraordinary dividends to the respective state departments of insurance for amounts over the lesser of a ten percent of surplus or net worth at the prior year end or b the net income for the prior year 
the discretion of the state regulators  if any  in approving or disapproving a dividend is not clearly defined 
health plans that declare non extraordinary dividends must usually provide notice to the regulators ten or fifteen days in advance of the intended distribution date of the non extraordinary dividend 
the aggregate amounts our health plan subsidiaries could have paid us at december    and without approval of the regulatory authorities were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
if the regulators were to deny or significantly restrict our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends to us  the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
for example  we could be hindered in our ability to make debt service payments under our credit facility and or our senior convertible notes 
unforeseen changes in regulations or pharmaceutical market conditions may impact our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 
a significant category of our health care costs relate to pharmaceutical products and services 
evolving regulations and state and federal mandates regarding coverage may impact the ability of our health plans to continue to receive existing price discounts on pharmaceutical products for our members 
other factors affecting our 
table of contents pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of pharmaceuticals  geographic variation in utilization of new and existing pharmaceuticals  and changes in discounts 
the unpredictable nature of these factors may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and stock price 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of our future testing  or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm  may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses 
our compliance with section will continue to require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time and effort 
moreover  if we are not able to continue to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses  the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse  sec or other regulatory authorities  which would require additional financial and management resources 
volatility of our stock price could adversely affect stockholders 
since our initial public offering in july  the sales price of our common stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
a number of factors will continue to influence the market price of our common stock  including changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates  if any  of public market analysts  announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors  state and federal budget decreases  adverse publicity regarding health maintenance organizations and other managed care organizations  government action regarding member eligibility  changes in government payment levels  changes in state mandatory programs  conditions generally affecting the managed care industry or our provider networks  the success of our operating or acquisition strategy  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies in the health care industry  the termination of our medicaid or chip contracts with state or county agencies  or subcontracts with other medicaid managed care organizations that contract with such state or county agencies  regulatory or legislative change  and general economic conditions  including unemployment rates  inflation  and interest rates 
our stock may not trade at the same levels as the stock of other health care companies or the market in general 
also  if the trading market for our stock does not continue to develop  securities analysts may not initiate or maintain research coverage of our company and our shares  and this could depress the market for our shares 

table of contents members of the molina family own a majority of our capital stock  decreasing the influence of other stockholders on stockholder decisions 
members of the molina family  either directly or as trustees or beneficiaries of molina family trusts  in the aggregate own or are entitled to receive upon certain events approximately of our capital stock 
our president and chief executive officer  as well as our chief financial officer  are members of the molina family  and they are also on our board of directors 
because of the amount of their shareholdings  molina family members  if they were to act as a group with the trustees of their family trusts  have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval  including the election and removal of directors  amendments to our charter  and any merger  consolidation  or sale of our company 
a significant concentration of share ownership can also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often discount the value of stock in companies that have controlling stockholders 
furthermore  the concentration of share ownership in the molina family could delay or prevent a merger or consolidation  takeover  or other business combination that could be favorable to our stockholders 
finally  the interests and objectives of the molina family may be different from those of our company or our other stockholders  and they may vote their common stock in a manner that is contrary to the vote of our other stockholders 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire our company  which could inhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price 
we are subject to the delaware anti takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors  prohibition of stockholder action by written consent  and advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 
in addition  changes of control are often subject to state regulatory notification  and in some cases  prior approval 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have not declared or paid any dividends since our initial public offering in july while we have in the past and may again use our available cash to repurchase our securities  we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
changes in accounting may affect our results of operations 
us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments 
changes in these rules or their interpretation  the adoption of new pronouncements or the application of existing pronouncements to our business could significantly affect our results of operations 
in october  we completed our offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement the fsp 
the fsp requires the proceeds from the issuance of such convertible debt instruments to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount is amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding  as additional non cash 
table of contents interest expense 
the change in accounting treatment is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively to prior periods 
the fsp changes the accounting treatment for our convertible senior notes 
the impact of this new accounting treatment will result in an increase to non cash interest expense beginning in fiscal year for financial statements covering past and future periods 
the incremental impact of the fsp to our results of operations in will be approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax 
this estimate does not include the impact of our repurchase of million face amount of the convertible senior notes in february we estimate the retroactive adjustment for prior periods will be approximately  or per diluted share  net of tax  for  and million  or per diluted share  net of tax  for our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
as of december   million par value fair value of million of our investments consisted of auction rate securities  all of which were securities collateralized by student loan portfolios  guaranteed by the us government 
we continued to earn interest on substantially all of these auction rate securities as of december  due to events in the credit markets  the auction rate securities held by us experienced failed auctions beginning in the first quarter of as such  quoted prices in active markets were not readily available during the majority of we used pricing models to estimate the fair value of these securities 
these pricing models included factors such as the collateral underlying the securities  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future cash flows  and the expectation of the next time the security would be expected to have a successful auction 
the estimated values of these securities were also compared  when possible  to valuation data with respect to similar securities held by other parties 
we concluded that these estimates  given the lack of market available pricing  provided a reasonable basis for determining fair value of the auction rate securities as of december  as of december   we held million par value fair value of million auction rate securities with a certain investment securities firm 
in november  we entered into a rights agreement with this firm that allows us to exercise rights the rights to sell the eligible auction rate securities at par value to this firm between june  and july   and gives the investment securities firm the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after the agreement date as long as we receive the par value 
we have accounted for the rights as a freestanding financial instrument and have elected to record the value of the rights under the fair value option of sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
in the fourth quarter of  this resulted in the recognition of a million non current asset  with a corresponding increase to pretax income for the value of the rights 
to determine the fair value estimate of the rights  we used a discounted cash flow model that was based on the expectation that the auction rate securities will be put back to the investment securities firm at par on june   as permitted by the rights agreement 
simultaneous to the recognition of the million rights agreement  we recorded an other than temporary impairment of the underlying auction rate securities  and prior unrealized losses on the auction rate securities that had been recorded to other comprehensive loss through november were charged to income  totaling million 
also  at the time of the execution of the rights agreement and pursuant to sfas  we elected to transfer the underlying auction rate securities from available for sale to trading securities 
for the month of december  we recorded additional losses of  on these auction rate securities 
we expect that the future changes in the fair value of the rights will be substantially offset by the fair value movements in the underlying auction rate securities 
as of december   the remainder of our auction rate securities  which are still designated as available for sale  amounted to million par value fair value of million 
as a result of the decline in fair value of these auction rate securities  we recorded unrealized losses of million to accumulated other comprehensive loss income for the year ended december  we have deemed these unrealized losses to be temporary and attribute the decline in value to liquidity issues  as a result of the failed auction market  rather than to credit issues 
any future fluctuation in fair value related to these instruments that we deem to be temporary  including any recoveries of previous write downs  would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
if we 
table of contents determine that any future valuation adjustment was other than temporary  we would record a charge to earnings as appropriate 
the value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions  and a decrease in value could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
our investments consist solely of investment grade debt securities 
the unrestricted portion of this portfolio is designated primarily as available for sale 
our non current restricted investments are designated as held to maturity 
available for sale investments are carried at fair value  and the unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders equity  unless the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary and we do not have the intent and ability to hold such securities until their full cost can be recovered 
trading securities are carried at fair value and any realized gains or losses are included as a component of earnings 
for our available for sale investments and held to maturity investments  if a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary and we do not have the intent and ability to hold such security until its full cost can be recovered  the security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired and it is written down to fair value and the loss is recorded as an expense 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we review our investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other than temporary 
this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment 
we conduct this review on a quarterly basis  using both quantitative and qualitative factors  to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary 
such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  recommendations of investment advisors and forecasts of economic  market or industry trends 
this review process also entails an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold individual securities until they mature or full cost can be recovered 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of the securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets 
during the year ended december   we recorded an other than temporary impairment of certain auction rate securities as described above  totaling million 
over time  the economic and market environment may further deteriorate or provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities  which could change our judgment regarding impairment 
this could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines or losses related to our trading securities to be recorded as an expense 
given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved  there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other than temporary impairments or trading security losses may result in realized losses in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information could have an adverse effect on our business 
as part of our normal operations  we collect  process and retain confidential member information 
we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information  including hipaa and the gramm leach bliley act 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of further expands the coverage of hipaa by  among other things  extending the privacy and security provisions  mandating new regulations around electronic medical records  expanding enforcement mechanisms  allowing the state attorneys general to bring enforcement actions and increasing penalties for violations 
despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers  may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors or other similar events 
any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information  whether by us or a third party  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 

table of contents we are dependent on our executive officers and other key employees 
our operations are highly dependent on the efforts of our executive officers 
the loss of their leadership  knowledge  and experience could negatively impact our operations 
replacing many of our executive officers might be difficult or take an extended period of time because a limited number of individuals in the managed care industry have the breadth and depth of skills and experience necessary to operate and expand successfully a business such as ours 
our success is also dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified management  technical  and medical personnel 
we may be unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining such personnel which could negatively impact our operations 
a pandemic  such as a worldwide outbreak of a new influenza virus  could materially and adversely affect our ability to control health care costs 
an outbreak of a pandemic disease  such as the hn avian flu  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
the impact of a flu pandemic on the united states would likely be substantial 
estimates of the contagion and mortality rate of any mutated avian flu virus that can be transmitted from human to human are highly speculative 
a significant global outbreak of avian flu among humans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increased inpatient and outpatient hospital costs and the cost of anti viral medication to treat the virus 
conversion of our senior convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders 
our convertible notes are convertible into cash and  under certain circumstances  shares of our common stock 
the conversion of some or all of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into cash and shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 
item b unresolved staff comments we have not received any comments from the staff of the securities and exchange commission which remain unresolved 
item properties we lease a total of facilities  including our corporate headquarters at oceangate in long beach  california  and of our california medical clinics 
we also own a  square foot office building in long beach  california  the  square foot data center nearing completion of construction in albuquerque  new mexico  and one of our medical clinics in pomona  california 
we believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future 
item legal proceedings the health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal  state  and local governments 
compliance with these laws and regulations can be subject to government review and interpretation  as well as regulatory actions unknown and unasserted at this time 
penalties associated with violations of these laws and regulations include significant fines and penalties  exclusion from participating in publicly funded programs  and the repayment of previously billed and collected revenues 
we are involved in legal actions in the ordinary course of business  some of which seek monetary damages  including claims for punitive damages  which are not covered by insurance 
the outcome of such legal actions is inherently uncertain 
nevertheless  we believe that these actions  when finally concluded and determined  are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

for the year ended december   we also received approximately of our premium revenue in the form of birth income a one time payment for the delivery of a child from the medicaid programs in michigan  missouri  ohio  texas  and washington 
such payments are recognized as revenue in the month the birth occurs 

table of contents certain components of premium revenue are subject to accounting estimates 
chief among these are that portion of premium revenue paid to our new mexico health plan by the state of new mexico that may be refunded to the state if certain minimum amounts are not expended on defined medical care costs  or if administrative costs or profit as defined exceed certain amounts  that portion of the revenue of our ohio health plan that is at risk if certain performance measures are not met  the additional premium revenue our utah health plan is entitled to receive from the state of utah as an incentive payment for saving the state of utah money in relation to fee for service medicaid  the profit sharing agreement between our texas health plan and the state of texas  where we pay a rebate to the state of texas if our texas health plan generates pretax income above a certain specified percentage  according to a tiered rebate schedule  and that portion of our medicare revenue that is subject to retroactive adjustment for member risk adjustment and recoupment of pharmacy related revenue 
our contract with the state of new mexico requires that we spend a minimum percentage of premium revenue on certain explicitly defined medical care costs the medical cost floor 
our contract is for a three year period  and the medical cost floor is based on premiums and medical care costs over the entire contract period 
during the six months ended june   we recorded adjustments totaling million to increase premium revenue associated with this requirement 
the revenue resulted from a reversal of previously recorded amounts due the state of new mexico when we were below the minimum percentage  because we exceeded the minimum percentage for the six months ended june  effective july   our new mexico health plan entered into a new three year contract that  in addition to retaining the medical cost floor  added certain limits on the amount our new mexico health plan can expend on administrative costs  and retain as profit 
at december   there was no liability recorded under the terms of these contract provisions 
any changes to the terms of these provisions  including revisions to the definitions of premium revenue  medical care costs  administrative costs or profit  the period of time over which performance is measured or the manner of its measurement  or the percentages used in the calculations  may trigger a change in the amounts owed 
if the state of new mexico disagrees with our interpretation of the existing contract terms  an adjustment to the amounts owed may be required 
under our contract with the state of ohio  up to of our ohio health plan s revenue may be refundable to the state if certain performance measures are not met 
at december   we had recorded a liability of approximately million under the terms of this contract provision 
in prior years  we estimated amounts we believed were recoverable under our savings sharing agreement with the state of utah based on available information and our interpretation of our contract with the state 
the state may not agree with our interpretation or our application of the contract language  and it may also not agree with the manner in which we have processed and analyzed our member claims and encounter records 
thus  the ultimate amount of savings sharing revenue that we realize from prior years may be subject to negotiation with the state 
during  as a result of an ongoing disagreement with the state of utah  we wrote off the entire receivable  totaling million 
our utah health plan continues to work with the state to assure an appropriate determination of amounts due to us under the savings share agreement 
when additional information is known  or agreement is reached with the state regarding the appropriate savings sharing payment amount for prior years  we will adjust the amount of savings sharing revenue recorded in our financial statements as appropriate in light of such new information or agreement 
as of december   we had a liability of approximately  accrued pursuant to our profit sharing agreement with the state of texas for the contract year ending august  and the contract year ending august  
during  we paid the state of texas million relating to the and contract years  and the contract year is now closed 
because the final settlement calculations include a claims run out period of nearly one year  the amounts recorded  based on our estimates  may be adjusted 
we believe that the ultimate settlement will not differ materially from our estimates 
medicare revenue paid to us is subject to retroactive adjustment for both member risk scores and member pharmacy cost experience 
based on member encounter data that we submit to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  our medicare revenue is subject to adjustment for up to two years after the original year of service 
this adjustment takes into account the acuity of each member s medical needs relative to what was anticipated when premiums were originally set for that member 
in the event that our membership measured on an 
table of contents individual by individual basis requires less acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may recover premium from us 
in the event that our membership requires more acute medical care than was anticipated by the original premium amount  cms may pay us additional retroactive premium 
a similar retroactive reconciliation is undertaken by cms for our medicare members pharmacy utilization 
that analysis is similar to the process for the adjustment of member risk scores  but is further complicated by member pharmacy cost sharing provisions attached to the medicare pharmacy benefit that do not apply to the services measured by the member risk adjustment process 
we estimate the amount of medicare revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our knowledge of our members heath care utilization patterns and cms practices 
to the extent that the premium revenue ultimately received from cms differs from recorded amounts  we will adjust reported medicare revenue 
historically  membership growth has been the primary reason for our increasing revenues  although more recently our revenues have also grown due to the more care intensive benefits associated with our abd and medicare members 
we have increased our membership through both internal growth and acquisitions

our results of operations are impacted by our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health care services and to accurately estimate costs incurred 
expenses related to medical care services are captured in the following four categories fee for service physician providers paid on a fee for service basis are paid according to a fee schedule set by the state or by our contracts with these providers 
we pay hospitals on a fee for service basis in a variety of ways  including per diem amounts  diagnostic related groups  or drgs  percent of billed charges  and case rates 
we also pay a small portion of hospitals on a capitated basis 
we also have stop loss agreements with the hospitals with which we contract  under certain circumstances  we pay escalated charges in connection with these stop loss agreements 
under all fee for service arrangements  we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided 
expenses related to fee for service contracts are recorded in the period in which the related services are dispensed 
the costs of drugs administered in a physician or hospital setting that are not billed through our pharmacy benefit managers are included in fee for service costs 
capitation many of our primary care physicians and a small portion of our specialists and hospitals are paid on a capitated basis 
under capitation contracts  we typically pay a fixed pmpm payment to the provider without regard to the frequency  extent  or nature of the medical services actually furnished 
under capitated contracts  we remain liable for the provision of certain health care services 
certain of our capitated 
table of contents contracts also contain incentive programs based on service delivery  quality of care  utilization management  and other criteria 
capitation payments are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates 
these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services 
the financial risk for pharmacy services for a small portion of our membership is delegated to capitated providers 
pharmacy pharmacy costs include all drug  injectibles  and immunization costs paid through our pharmacy benefit managers 
as noted above  drugs and injectibles not paid through our pharmacy benefit managers are included in fee for service costs  except in those limited instances where we capitate drug and injectible costs 
other other medical care costs include medically related administrative costs  certain provider incentive costs  reinsurance cost  and other health care expense 
medically related administrative costs include  for example  expenses relating to health education  quality assurance  case management  disease management  hour on call nurses  and a portion of our information technology costs 
salary and benefit costs are a substantial portion of these expenses

the results of operations for mercy careplus are included in the consolidated financial statements from periods following november  the purchase price for the acquisition was million  and was funded with available cash and proceeds from our issuance of convertible senior notes in october the purchase price was subject to the following post closing adjustments a reconciliation with respect to incurred but not reported medical costs  a settlement of income taxes  and the payment of an additional million to the sellers if the earnings of the health plan as defined in the purchase agreement exceeded million for the twelve months ended june  upon evaluation  we have preliminarily determined that the sellers owe us approximately  in connection with the reconciliation of incurred but not reported medical costs  we owe the sellers approximately  in connection with the settlement of income taxes  and the earnings condition was not met  so we believe that we do not owe the sellers the additional million payment 
however  the sellers have objected to our first and third determinations as listed above  and the dispute resolution process provided for under the parties stock purchase agreement has commenced

liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments  and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility 
we forecast  analyze  and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue and investment income 
such cash flows are our primary source of liquidity 
thus  any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
we generally receive premium revenue in advance of the payment of claims for the related health care services 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term  investment grade  marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
these investments are made pursuant to board approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital  and maximize total return on invested assets  all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest 
these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of ten years or less excluding auction rate securities and variable rate securities  for which interest rates are periodically reset and that the average maturity be four years or less 
professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments 
as of december   a substantial portion of our cash was invested in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities  and our investments consisted solely of investment grade debt securities 
for a comprehensive discussion of our auction rate securities  see fair value measurements  below 
our restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and us treasury securities 
all of our investments are classified as current assets  except for our investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as non current assets 
the average annualized portfolio yields for the years ended december    and were approximately   and  respectively 
investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our restricted investments until maturity and  as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid to our non regulated parent company in the form of dividends  when and as permitted by applicable regulations  for general corporate use 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for  a decrease of million 
the significant components of the decrease in cash provided by operating activities included the following receivables year over year increase in due primarily to higher birth income receivables as a result of increased enrollment in ohio and missouri  combined with the addition of receivables from the acquisition of our missouri health plan in the fourth quarter of  medical claims and benefits payable year over year decrease due primarily to the ramp up of membership and medical claims at the texas and ohio health plans in compared with less significant changes for those plans in  deferred revenue year over year decrease due primarily to the timing of the ohio health plan s receipts of premium payments from the state of ohio  income taxes the increase in income taxes receivable  combined with the decrease in income taxes payable  due to timing of receipts and payments 

table of contents cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the much greater amount invested in relates to the million in proceeds from our issuance of million senior convertible notes and our million purchase of our missouri health plan  mercy careplus  both of which occurred in the fourth quarter of  with no comparable activity in cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million provided by financing activities for the primary use of cash in was million in repurchases of our common stock  compared with cash provided by  in  the million net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes  offset by the reduction in borrowings and the repayment of amounts owed under our credit facility 
the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past year  and as a result the availability of credit has been severely restricted 
such conditions may persist throughout in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses  make payments on our indebtedness  pay capital expenditures  or fund acquisitions  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant  particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility 
while we have not attempted to access the credit markets recently  we believe that if credit could be obtained  the terms and costs of such credit would be significantly less favorable to us than what was obtained in our most recent financings 
repurchase programs 
under our board of directors authorization  we undertook two common stock share repurchase programs in during  we repurchased approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million in aggregate of either our common stock or our convertible senior notes 
in february  we paid approximately million to repurchase million face amount of our convertible senior notes 
in february and march  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
shelf registration statement 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission covering the issuance of up to million of our securities  including common stock  warrants  or debt securities  and up to  shares of outstanding common stock that may be sold from time to time by the molina siblings trust 
we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
capital resources at december   we had working capital of million compared with million at december  at december  and december   cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively 
at december  and december   investments were million and million  respectively 
in  this total included million in auction rate securities classified as non current assets 
in  all investments were classified as current assets 
at december   the parent company molina healthcare  inc had cash and investments of approximately million 
we believe that our cash resources and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations  regulatory requirements  and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
ebitda three months ended year ended december  december  in thousands operating income add back depreciation and amortization expense ebitda we calculate ebitda by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to operating income 
operating income included interest income of million and million for the years ended december  
table of contents and  respectively 
ebitda is not prepared in conformity with gaap since it excludes depreciation and amortization expense  as well as interest expense  and the provision for income taxes 
this non gaap financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  operating margin  or cash provided by operating activities 
management uses ebitda as a supplemental metric in evaluating our financial performance  in evaluating financing and business development decisions  and in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
for these reasons  management believes that ebitda is a useful supplemental measure to investors in evaluating our performance and the performance of other companies in our industry 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted sfas  fair value measurements  for financial assets and liabilities 
the statement defines fair value  provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures 
sfas discusses valuation techniques  such as the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flow and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
the statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the following is a brief description of those three levels level observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active 
level unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions 
as of december   we held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these included cash and cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments as follows balance sheet classification description current assets cash and cash equivalents cash and highly liquid securities with original or purchase date remaining maturities of up to three months that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash  reported at fair value based on market prices that are readily available level 
investments investment grade debt securities  designated as available for sale  reported at fair value based on market prices that are readily available level 
non current assets investments auction rate securities  designated as available for sale  reported at fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model level 
auction rate securities  designated as trading  reported at fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model level 
other assets auction rate securities rights the rights  reported at fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model level 
restricted investments interest bearing deposits and us treasury securities required by the respective states in which we operate  or required by contractual arrangement with a third party such as a provider group  designated as held to maturity  reported at amortized cost which approximates market value and based on market prices that are readily available level 
as of december   million par value fair value of million of our investments consisted of auction rate securities  of which all were securities collateralized by student loan portfolios  guaranteed by the us government 
we continued to earn interest on substantially all of these auction rate securities as of december  due to events in the credit markets  the auction rate securities held by us experienced failed auctions beginning in the first quarter of as such  quoted prices in active markets were not readily available during the majority of we used pricing models to estimate the fair value of these securities 
these pricing 
table of contents models included factors such as the collateral underlying the securities  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future cash flows  and the expectation of the next time the security would be expected to have a successful auction 
the estimated values of these securities were also compared  when possible  to valuation data with respect to similar securities held by other parties 
we concluded that these estimates  given the lack of market available pricing  provided a reasonable basis for determining fair value of the auction rate securities as of december  as of december   we held million par value fair value of million auction rate securities with a certain investment securities firm 
in november  we entered into a rights agreement with this firm that allows us to exercise rights the rights to sell the eligible auction rate securities at par value to this firm between june  and july   and gives the investment securities firm the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after the agreement date as long as we receive the par value 
we have accounted for the rights as a freestanding financial instrument and have elected to record the value of the rights under the fair value option of sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
in the fourth quarter of  this resulted in the recognition of a million non current asset  with a corresponding increase to pretax income for the value of the rights 
to determine the fair value estimate of the rights  we used a discounted cash flow model that was based on the expectation that the auction rate securities will be put back to the investment securities firm at par on june   as permitted by the rights agreement 
simultaneous to the recognition of the million rights agreement  we recorded an other than temporary impairment of the underlying auction rate securities  and prior unrealized losses on the auction rate securities that had been recorded to other comprehensive loss through november were charged to income  totaling million 
also  at the time of the execution of the rights agreement and pursuant to sfas  we elected to transfer the underlying auction rate securities from available for sale to trading securities 
for the month of december  we recorded additional losses of  on these auction rate securities 
we expect that the future changes in the fair value of the rights will be substantially offset by the fair value movements in the underlying auction rate securities 
as of december   the remainder of our auction rate securities  which are still designated as available for sale  amounted to million par value fair value of million 
as a result of the decline in fair value of these auction rate securities  we recorded unrealized losses of million to accumulated other comprehensive loss income for the year ended december  we have deemed these unrealized losses to be temporary and attribute the decline in value to liquidity issues  as a result of the failed auction market  rather than to credit issues 
any future fluctuation in fair value related to these instruments that we deem to be temporary  including any recoveries of previous write downs  would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
if we determine that any future valuation adjustment was other than temporary  we would record a charge to earnings as appropriate 
long term debt convertible senior notes in october  we completed our offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes 
the sale of the notes resulted in net proceeds totaling million 
the notes rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes are convertible into cash and  under certain circumstances  shares of our common stock 
the initial conversion rate is shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the notes 
this represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
in addition  if certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control occur prior to maturity  we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances 
prior to july  holders may convert their notes only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter after our fiscal quarter ending december   if the closing sale price per share of our common stock  for each of at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter  is greater than or equal to of the conversion price per share of our common stock  
table of contents during the five business day period immediately following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of the notes for each trading day of such period was less than of the product of the closing price per share of our common stock on such day and the conversion rate in effect on such day  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions or other specified events 
on or after july   holders may convert their notes at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions is satisfied 
we will deliver cash and shares of our common stock  if any  upon conversion of each  principal amount of notes  as follows an amount in cash the principal return equal to the sum of  for each of the volume weighted average price vwap trading days during the conversion period  the lesser of the daily conversion value for such vwap trading day and representing th of  and a number of shares based upon  for each of the vwap trading days during the conversion period  any excess of the daily conversion value above on february   we settled the repurchase of million face amount of our convertible senior notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we repurchased the notes at an average price of per principal amount  for a total of million 
including accrued interest of approximately  our total payment was million 
credit facility in  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of march   among molina healthcare inc  certain lenders  and bank of america na  as administrative agent the credit facility 
effective may  we entered into a third amendment of the credit facility that increased the size of the revolving line of credit from million to million  maturing in may the credit facility is intended to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  and subject to obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfaction of other specified conditions  we may increase the amount available under the credit facility to up to million 
interest rates on borrowings under the credit facility are based  at our election  on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  or the base rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate equals the higher of bank of america s prime rate or above the federal funds rate 
we also pay a commitment fee on the total unused commitments of the lenders under the credit facility 
the applicable margins and commitment fee are based on our ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
the applicable margins range between and for libor loans and between and for base rate loans 
the commitment fee ranges between and 
in addition  we are required to pay a fee for each letter of credit issued under the credit facility equal to the applicable margin for libor loans and a customary fronting fee 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of the capital stock of our health plan subsidiaries with the exception of the california health plan 
the credit facility includes usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including covenants limiting liens  mergers  asset sales  other fundamental changes  debt  acquisitions  dividends and other distributions  capital expenditures  investments  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated ebitda of not more than to at any time 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit facility 

table of contents regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our principal operations are conducted through our ten health plan subsidiaries operating in california  florida  michigan  missouri  nevada  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington 
the health plans are subject to state laws that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and may restrict the timing  payment  and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to molina healthcare  inc as the sole stockholder of each of our health plans 
to the extent the subsidiaries must comply with these regulations  they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us 
the net assets in these subsidiaries  after intercompany eliminations  which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans  advances  or cash dividends totaled million at december   and million at december  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has established model rules which  if adopted by a particular state  set minimum capitalization requirements for health plans and other insurance entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital  or rbc  rules 
these rules  which vary slightly from state to state  have been adopted in florida  michigan  nevada  new mexico  ohio  texas  utah  and washington 
california has not adopted rbc rules and has not given notice of any intention to do so 
the rbc rules  if adopted by california  may increase the minimum capital required by that state 
at december   our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared to the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million 
all of our health plans were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements at december  we have the ability and commitment to provide additional working capital to each of our health plans when necessary to ensure that capital and surplus continue to meet regulatory requirements 
barring any change in regulatory requirements  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements through critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations in any given period 
such determination of our liability requires the application of a significant degree of judgment by our management 
as a result  the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our medical care costs include amounts that have been paid by us through the reporting date  as well as estimated liabilities for medical care costs incurred but not paid by us as of the reporting date 
such medical care cost liabilities include  among other items  unpaid fee for service claims  capitation payments owed providers  unpaid pharmacy invoices  and various medically related administrative costs that have been incurred but not paid 
we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates 
the most important element in estimating our medical care costs is our estimate for fee for service claims which have been incurred but not paid by us 
these fee for service costs that have been incurred but have not been paid at the reporting date are collectively referred to as medical costs that are incurred but not paid  or ibnp 
our ibnp claims reserve  as reported in our balance sheet  represents our best estimate of the total amount of claims we will ultimately pay with respect to claims that we have incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we estimate our ibnp monthly using actuarial methods based on a number of factors 
our estimated ibnp liability represented million of our total medical claims and benefits payable of million as of december  excluding amounts related to our cost plus medicaid contract in utah and amounts that we anticipate paying on behalf of a capitated provider in ohio which we will subsequently withhold from that provider s monthly capitation payment  our ibnp liability at december  was million 
the factors we consider when estimating our ibnp include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our assessment of these 
table of contents factors is then translated into an estimate of our ibnp liability at the relevant measuring point through the calculation of a base estimate of ibnp  a further reserve for adverse claims development  and an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the base estimate of ibnp is derived through application of claims payment completion factors and trended per member per month pmpm cost estimates 
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier  we estimate our outstanding claims liability based on actual claims paid  adjusted for estimated completion factors 
completion factors seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date  based on historical payment patterns 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding december   by the percentages indicated 
a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
our utah health plan is excluded from these calculations  because the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost plus reimbursement contract 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in increase decrease in estimated medical claims and completion factors benefits payable for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date  actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability  given the inherent delay between the patient physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment 
for these months of service  we estimate our claims liability based on trended pmpm cost estimates 
these estimates are designed to reflect recent trends in payments and expense  utilization patterns  authorized services  and other relevant factors 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december   that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated 
an increase in the pmpm costs results in an increase in medical claims liabilities 
our utah health plan is excluded from these calculations  because the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost plus reimbursement contract 
dollar amounts are in thousands 
decrease increase in decrease increase in trended per member per month medical claims and cost estimates benefits payable the following per share amounts are based on a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of  and million diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december  assuming a hypothetical change in completion factors from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax 
assuming a hypothetical change in pmpm cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnp at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share  net of tax 
the corresponding figures for a change in completion 
table of contents factors and pmpm cost estimates would be million  or per diluted share  net of tax  and million  or per diluted share  net of tax  respectively 
it is important to note that any change in the estimate of either completion factors or trended pmpm costs would usually be accompanied by an change in the estimate of the other component  and that an change in one component would almost always compound rather than offset the resulting distortion to net income 
when completion factors are overestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be underestimated 
both circumstances will create an overstatement of net income 
likewise  when completion factors are underestimated  trended pmpm costs tend to be overestimated  creating an understatement of net income 
in other words  errors in estimates involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will usually act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and medical care costs in the same direction 
for example  if completion factors were overestimated by  resulting in an overstatement of net income by approximately million  it is likely that trended pmpm costs would be underestimated  resulting in an additional overstatement of net income 
after we have established our base ibnp reserve through the application of completion factors and trended pmpm cost estimates  we then compute an additional liability  which also uses actuarial techniques  to account for adverse developments in our claims payments which the base actuarial model is not intended to and does not account for 
we refer to this additional liability as the provision for adverse claims development 
the provision for adverse claims development is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnp 
it is intended to capture the potential inadequacy of our ibnp estimate as a result of our inability to adequately assess the impact of factors such as changes in the speed of claims receipt and payment  the relative magnitude or severity of claims  known outbreaks of disease such as influenza  our entry into new geographical markets  our provision of services to new populations such as the aged  blind or disabled abd  changes to state controlled fee schedules upon which much of our provider payments are based  modifications and upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices  and increasing medical costs 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states  we make an overall assessment of ibnp after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for adverse claims development 
we also include in our ibnp liability an estimate of the administrative costs of settling all claims incurred through the reporting date 
the development of ibnp is a continuous process that we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims payment information becomes available 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish ibnp 
on a monthly basis  we review and update our estimated ibnp liability and the methods used to determine that liability 
any adjustments  if appropriate  are reflected in the period known 
while we believe our current estimates are adequate  we have in the past been required to increase significantly our claims reserves for periods previously reported and may be required to do so again in the future 
any significant increases to prior period claims reserves would materially decrease reported earnings for the period in which the adjustment is made 
in our judgment  the estimates for completion factors will likely prove to be more accurate than trended pmpm cost estimates because estimated completion factors are subject to fewer variables in their determination 
specifically  completion factors are developed over long periods of time  and are most likely to be affected by changes in claims receipt and payment experience and by provider billing practices 
trended pmpm cost estimates  while affected by the same factors  will also be influenced by health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
as discussed above  however  errors in estimates involving trended pmpm costs will almost always be accompanied by errors in estimates involving completion factors  and vice versa 
in such circumstances  errors in estimation involving both completion factors and trended pmpm costs will act to drive estimates of claims liabilities and therefore medical care costs in the same direction 
assuming that base reserves have been adequately set  we believe that amounts ultimately paid out should generally be between and less than the liability recorded at the end of the period as a result of the inclusion in that liability of the allowance for adverse claims development and the accrued cost of settling those claims 
however  there can be no assurance that amounts ultimately paid out will not be higher or lower than this to 
table of contents range  as shown by our results in and when the amounts ultimately paid out were less than the amount of the reserves we had established as of the beginning of those years by approximately and  respectively 
as shown in greater detail in the table below  the amounts ultimately paid out on our liabilities recorded at both december  and were less than what we had expected when we established our reserves 
while the specific reasons for the overestimation of our liabilities were different at each of the two reporting dates  in general the overestimations were tied to our assessment of specific circumstances at our various individual health plans which were unique to those reporting periods 
in  overestimation of our claims liability  particularly at our michigan and washington health plans  at december  led to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development 
in michigan  we overestimated the extent to which both catastrophic claims and state mandated changes to the methodology used to pay outpatient claims had increased our liability at december  in washington  we overestimated the extent to which state mandated changes to hospital fee schedules implemented in august had increased our liability at december  in  overestimation of the claims liability at our california  new mexico  and washington health plans at december   led to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development  which benefit was partially offset by the underestimation of our claims liability at december  at our michigan health plan 
in california  we underestimated the impact of changes to certain provider contracts implemented during the second half of which lowered medical costs further than we had anticipated  leading us to overestimate our claims liability at december  in washington  we overestimated the impact of the upward trend in medical costs during the latter half of additionally  we lowered claims inventory in december in anticipation of a claims system upgrade in early while we attempted to adjust our claims liability estimation procedures for the increased speed of claims payment  we were only partially successful in doing so 
both of these circumstances led us to overestimate our claims liability at december  in michigan  we underestimated the upward trend in medical costs during the latter half of additionally  we underestimated the costs associated with the membership we had added as a result of our acquisition of cape health plan in may we do not believe that the recognition of a benefit or detriment from prior period claims development had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations in either or in estimating our claims liability at december   we adjusted our base calculation to take account of the impact of the following factors which we believe are reasonably likely to change our final claims liability amount uncertainties regarding utilization trends in december at our california health plan 
delays in the receipt and processing of paper formatted claims at our california health plan during the second half of our california health plan receives a far higher percentage of its fee for service claims in paper format than do our other health plans 
the impact of accruals for potential high dollar provider settlements at our new mexico health plan that we expect to be resolved in the impact of major revisions to financially significant provider contracts at the ohio health plan in the latter half of the impact of a significant increase to the ohio health plan s aged  blind or disabled abd membership in the latter half of the impact of the ohio health plan s decision to transition responsibility for the management of behavioral health services from an independent provider to company employees in the latter half of decreases in claims inventory across all of our health plans throughout 
table of contents any absence of adverse claims development as well as the expensing through general and administrative expense of the costs to settle claims held at the start of the period will lead to the recognition of a benefit from prior period claims development in the period subsequent to the date of the original estimate 
however  that benefit will affect current period earnings only to the extent that the replenishment of the reserve for adverse claims development and the re accrual of administrative costs for the settlement of those claims is less than the benefit recognized from the prior period liability 
we seek to maintain a consistent claims reserving methodology across all periods 
accordingly  any prior period benefit from an un utilized reserve for adverse claims development may be offset by the establishment of a new reserve in an approximately equal amount relative to premium revenue  medical care costs  and medical claims and benefits payable in the current period  and thus the impact on earnings for the current period may be minimal 
the following table presents the components of the change in our medical claims and benefits payable for the years ended december  and the negative amounts displayed for components of medical care costs related to prior years represent the amount by which our original estimate of claims and benefits payable at the beginning of the period exceeded the actual amount of the liability based on information principally the payment of claims developed since that liability was first reported 
the benefit of this prior period development may be offset by the addition of a reserve for adverse claims development when estimating the liability at the end of the period captured as a component of medical care costs related to current year

inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and health care cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national health care cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies will mitigate health care cost inflation  competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control health care costs
