please refer to item a of this form k for a discussion of forward looking statements and certain risk factors that may have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to january  which results in some fiscal years with weeks and some with weeks 
fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
fiscal years and each were comprised of weeks 
operating results summary the following are the results from that we believe are key indicators of our operating performance when compared to our operating performance in comparable store sales for stores open at least two years at the beginning of increased 
sales per selling square foot were in and in net sales declined as we operated an average of  stores throughout compared to  average stores throughout gross margin as a percent of sales increased basis points to of sales in from of sales in gross margin dollars were higher by 
average inventory levels were lower throughout compared to and  combined with the increase in comparable store sales  resulted in a higher inventory turnover rate of times in compared to times in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales increased basis points to of sales from of sales in depreciation expense as a percent of sales decreased basis points to of sales in from of sales in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations improved to per share in compared to per share in cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in our total inventory per average store was flat at the end of compared to our accounts payable leverage declined at the end of as a result of a shift in our merchandise mix to higher purchases from vendors which have shorter payment terms  many of whom offer cash discounts 
the decline in our accounts payable leverage compares to the increase in leverage during additionally  we paid income taxes of million in compared to million in we acquired million of our common shares in under our publicly announced repurchase program for a total cost of million

see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional detail on these matters 
in  we recorded pretax income of million less than basis points in selling and administrative expenses upon receipt of our portion of the visa mastercard antitrust litigation settlement funds that compensate merchants for the excessive fees paid for certain visa and mastercard transactions 
seasonality as discussed in item business  under the seasonality caption  our financial results fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on various factors such as timing of new or closed stores  timing and extent of advertisements and promotions  and timing of holidays 
we expect that the christmas holiday selling season will continue to result in a significant portion of our sales and operating profits 
if our sales performance is significantly better or worse during this time frame  we would expect a more pronounced impact on our annual financial results 
the following table sets forth the seasonality of net sales and operating profit for and by fiscal quarter first second third fourth fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit as a percentage of full year fiscal year net sales percentage of full year operating profit as a percentage of full year operating strategy in august  we introduced our operating strategy called the what s important now strategy win strategy 
the win strategy is comprised of three distinct elements merchandising  real estate  and cost structure 
over the last three years  our strategy has followed a roadmap focused on expanding our operating profit rate which increased from in to in  driving growth in earnings per share from continuing operations which increased from per diluted share in to per diluted share in  and generating significant cash provided by operating activities to reinvest in the business or to return to shareholders million in aggregate share repurchases in  and under publicly announced share repurchase programs 
in  we expect our operating profit rate to be flat to down basis points based on our projections that comparable store sales will be flat to down and the gross margin rate will be similar to  earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be to  and cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures of approximately to million to be approximately million 
the following sections provide additional discussion and analysis of our win strategy with respect to merchandising  real estate  and cost structure 
the compared to section below provides additional discussion and analysis of the impact of these strategies on our financial performance and the assumptions and expectations upon which we are basing our guidance for our future results 
merchandising we developed our merchandise strategy with the goals of growing sales per selling square foot which increased from per square foot in to per square foot in and increasing gross margin dollars which increased from  million in to  million in 
our customer surveys have confirmed that brand name merchandise at extreme value  the treasure hunt experience  price  value  and savings are most important to our customers 
the treasure hunt experience is how our customers refer to the experience of shopping our stores looking for their favorite brands of merchandise at great values as our assortment of branded merchandise continually changes based on the availability of closeout merchandise 
in  we refined our detailed merchandising plans to improve the understanding of each of our merchants regarding his or her targeted levels of closeout merchandise  engineered closeout merchandise items that we develop along with our vendors  and merchandise categories that we consistently stock 
our objective is to maximize the amount of closeout merchandise which we believe provides the greatest value to our customers 
we have communicated many of these expectations to our vendors so that they understand our expectations and work with us to offer the desired types and quantities of merchandise in our stores 
we constantly evaluate our mix of closeout merchandise and merchandise that we consistently stock 
our future net sales results could fluctuate materially depending on the availability  timing  and or size of closeout deals 
one of the key elements to the success of our merchandising strategy over the past few years has been to offer our customers better quality merchandise  better values  and more prominent brand name products 
this strategy involved offering a merchandise mix to the customer that included items with slightly higher average item retail sales price 
one method used to accomplish this was to offer larger package or quantity sizes 
for example  instead of offering an item for sale on a per piece basis  we offered the same product in a package of multiple pieces 
another part of the strategy involved offering merchandise with higher average item retails  based on our belief that as long as the value proposition is compelling  our customers are willing to purchase higher ticket merchandise from us 
based on our customer surveys  our customers want higher quality merchandise  which often results in higher average item retail 
this strategy has resulted in fewer cartons processed by our distribution centers and stores and achieved positive comparable store sales 
from a merchandising perspective in  our goal is to continue to provide unmatched value  better quality  and continue to increase the recognized brand name merchandise as a percentage of the overall merchandise assortment 
because of our long standing relationships with our vendor partners  we anticipate brand name closeout merchandise deals will continue to be available to us to purchase at savings that we can pass on to our customers 
in  we expect our major merchandise categories will remain the same as prior years but the percentage of business by category may fluctuate from time to time based on customer demand and the availability of compelling deals that we are able to source and offer in our stores 
our marketing efforts involve a mix of printed circulars  in store marketing  television  and online advertising 
many of the products we offer in our circulars are a result of the merchandising strategies discussed above 
the planning and coordination that goes into these circulars improves their effectiveness and helps to drive sales  gross margin dollars  and the inventory turnover rate 
much of our marketing is based on information that we have learned about our customers  principally through customer surveys 
based on this information  we believe over of our customers come to our stores without a shopping list or without a specific item or brand in mind to buy 
value dominates top of mind awareness as our customers look to us for savings 
almost one half of our customers surveyed said their shopping trips last over minutes  which we interpret as them coming to shop our stores for the treasure hunt 
we have improved  and expect to continue to develop  our in store signage and merchandising displays and arrangements 
lastly  we continue to market to our buzz club  by offering a free online membership and alerting them to new merchandise and offerings in our stores 
from a marketing perspective in  we plan to increase the focus on our messages of value and savings available to customers who shop our stores 
our new in store signage  print  and television advertising will emphasize these messages 
the marketing efforts and in store presentation will focus on merchandise categories that we believe our customers are most interested in  such as consumables and hardlines  and that offer particularly great value to the customer 
from a store operations perspective  we have initiated a ready for business program  which is aimed at improving our net sales by focusing on the consistency and timeliness of in store merchandising execution and generally improving customer service 
the program also focuses on improvements in our employee training programs and hiring practices  and implementation of our merchandising strategies including presentation of merchandise in our stores 
we believe that improvements made in these areas of our stores will result in a better shopping experience for our customers and  in turn  may result in higher net sales for us 
real estate in  we slowed our rate of new store openings based on our recent new store performance and the belief that the real estate locations available to us in the marketplace were too expensive and as such the return on investment would not be satisfactory to our shareholders 
during through  we opened a total of only new stores in  in  and in 
during the same timeframe  we closed existing stores in  in  and in for various reasons including lack of profitability  proposed new lease terms where rents were escalating and landlords were unwilling to renegotiate terms  or relocating the store to a better or potentially more productive location 
throughout  economic conditions in the united states deteriorated leading many retailers to close significant numbers of stores that were similar in size to our stores and were located in markets of interest to us 
many of these same retailers have scaled back planned future capital expenditures  including their future store opening plans 
these developments  along with other economic factors  have led to real estate opportunities at favorable lease rates  the availability of higher quality locations  and the availability of more locations 
as a result of improvements in our store productivity and overall profitability over the last three years and the softening of the real estate market  we expect to grow our store base in for the first time in the last five years 
we plan to open new stores and close approximately stores in the openings are expected to be throughout the country with the largest concentration of new stores in the northeast  north carolina  south carolina  florida  california  oregon  and washington 
these markets have historically been some of the more difficult areas to find store leases in our price range 
additionally  in we plan to test a smaller approximately  gross square feet store to better understand the impact that carrying an edited assortment of merchandise in a smaller store has on sales productivity and profitability 
we believe there are a number of store locations available to us in this size range 
if successful  a smaller store could represent additional growth opportunities for us over the long term 
we expect to test the small store concept during before making any determination about future inclusion of this store concept in our long term strategy 
we believe we have opportunities with respect to the lease options included in our existing store leases 
as stated in item properties  of this form k  we have store leases that expire in we expect to close approximately of these stores  some of which have not performed to our expectations  some of which have no more lease renewal options and we expect the landlord to choose a different tenant  and some of which we anticipate exiting by our choice in favor of relocating the store to a new location in a nearby area 
for our remaining plus store locations  we expect to exercise our renewal option or negotiate more favorable lease renewal terms sufficient enough to enable us to achieve an acceptable return on our investment 
our strategy has included the following additional investments in our existing fleet of stores in order to improve operating efficiency in and  we invested approximately million to implement our new point of sale register system in all of our existing stores with the expected benefits to include more timely and accurate sales and inventory information  improved customer service through faster speed at checkout  lower repair and maintenance costs  and improved labor efficiency through the use of hand held technology 
in and  we invested approximately million in store retrofits and new merchandise fixtures at approximately of our stores to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications 
with respect to the store retrofits that were completed in and  stores were chosen based on several factors including  but not limited to  store size  whether the store had a full furniture department or was limited to a lesser offering of furniture  overall sales volume  and comparable store sales trend 
as a result  we refreshed these stores  improved their financial performance in the aggregate  and  we believe  improved the customer shopping experience 
based on the results  we have determined that we get the best return on our investment when we add a full furniture department to a store 
nearly  of our stores have a full furniture department and the balance of our  stores is space constrained 
therefore  any future store retrofit activity of this type is expected to be minimal 
however  it is likely that we will continue to maintain and invest in our existing stores and will test new store layouts or merchandise presentation ideas in the future 
while we believe the completed retrofits have positively impacted our operating results with a minor impact on our liquidity  we do not believe that the results of the retrofits represent a material factor in our detailed discussion of changes in net sales  gross margin  selling and administrative expenses  or depreciation expense 
in  we will be testing a new store layout in the columbus  ohio market and in a group of approximately test locations across the country 
the layout test aims to improve the ease of shopping our stores 
it features consumables more prominently in our store and improves the sight lines within the store 
the initial customer reaction indicates that the store seems better organized  is cleaner  and has improved lighting  wider aisles  and generally presents merchandise more effectively 
we expect the new layout to be implemented in the columbus  ohio market by the end of the first quarter of and the additional test stores will be completed by the end of the second quarter of we intend to monitor and evaluate performance of these layout test stores during before making any determination about the future rollout of the new layout to additional stores 
an additional investment we intend to pursue during involves our food department which is a part of our consumables category 
the food refresh program emphasizes cleanliness and merchandise presentation and it includes new or refinished fixtures in approximately one half of our stores with new signage and shelf labeling 
based on feedback from our customers  we believe improved cleanliness  better fixtures  and dedicated associate staffing to maintain a better merchandise presentation  should instill customer confidence in the quality and freshness of our food merchandise 
cost structure our goal is to continue to generate expense leverage lower depreciation and selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 
we believe that several operational changes we have made  which we continue to refine  have significantly contributed to the achievement of our leverage goals 
some of the operational changes that we have made include reducing inventory levels at our stores and regional distribution centers  buying and distributing merchandise to our stores in optimal quantities and pack sizes to minimize handling in our distribution centers and stores  timing receipt of merchandise in stores close to the expected display dates in order to avoid excessive handling of merchandise  increasing the percentage of merchandise that arrives in our stores pre ticketed and pre packaged for efficient display and sale  refining our staffing and payroll scheduling models in our stores  and implementing several initiatives which lowered our distribution and outbound transportation expenses 
with respect to distribution and outbound transportation expenses  we have taken advantage of several opportunities for improvement 
distribution of furniture differs from our other merchandise categories in part due to the bulk of the product and the impact of that bulk on shipments 
prior to july  furniture was distributed to our stores from our two furniture distribution centers 
the majority of our stores received a weekly shipment of merchandise from a regional distribution center one day and a separate shipment of furniture from one of our furniture distribution centers on a different day 
this process was inefficient for our stores and distribution centers 
improvements in managing our inventory and turning our inventory faster have lowered our inventories and created capacity in our regional distribution centers 
beginning in july  furniture is distributed to many of our stores through four of our regional distribution centers and combined with other merchandise which results in fewer shipments and trailers  more efficient unloading processes and less payroll hours needed at the store level 
we continue to operate a furniture distribution center in redlands  california  which distributes furniture to many of our west coast stores 
additionally  we benchmark all aspects of our transportation in an effort to find new ways to reduce expenses 
as a result  we have improved our processes  including optimizing the timing of deliveries  and we have implemented a vendor compliance program that has generated savings 
we also have reduced our trailer fleet size and changed our mix of carriers 
in certain cases  we have found it to be less expensive overall to use third parties to make one way shipments where we have historically used our own fleet for round trips 
while our cost per mile has increased  we have significantly reduced the number of miles required to deliver our merchandise 
discontinued operations we continue to incur exit related costs for some of the stores we closed in that we have classified as discontinued operations  specifically on the stores where lease obligations remain 
we also report certain activity related to our prior ownership of the kb toys business in discontinued operations 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of all of our discontinued operations 
compared to net sales as previously discussed  we report net sales information for six merchandise categories in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
net sales by merchandise category  as a percentage of total net sales  and net sales change in dollars and percentage in compared to were as follows change in thousands consumables    home    furniture    hardlines    seasonal    other    net sales    net sales decreased million to  million in compared to  million in there were fewer open stores in which caused a decrease of million partially offset by our comparable store sales increase of  which increased sales by million 
our comparable store sales are calculated by using all stores that were open for at least two fiscal years as of the beginning of this calculation may not be comparable to other retailers who calculate comparable store sales based on other methods or criteria 
following a comparable store sales increase of in the first half of  sales trends softened resulting in a comparable store sales decrease of in the second half of we believe that our comparable store sales results in the third and fourth quarters were in part due to the worsening general economic trends 
as a result of the current general economic trends  consumers may elect to forego purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news 
reduced consumer spending may reduce our net sales 
based on sales trends in january and february  and on current general economic trends  we expect comparable store sales to be flat to a decline of in from a merchandise perspective  the consumables  hardlines  and furniture categories net sales increased while net sales of home  other  and seasonal declined 
consumables continued its consistent sales growth throughout the year 
as the year progressed  consumers chose to seek out value when shopping for the everyday household use items that we offer in our consumables business 
we believe our strategy of offering name brands at competitive prices has led to this consistently positive net sales performance in the consumables category 
the hardlines category increase in net sales was driven by the availability in the second half of of multiple closeout deals containing higher ticket electronics  highlighted by significant values on items such as popular video games and personal computer laptops from national brand manufacturers 
the furniture category increase was driven by sales of mattresses  which were attributable to the customer response throughout the year especially when promotional pricing was coupled with holiday events such as the labor day mattress promotion 
the home category net sales consistently underperformed throughout the year continuing a trend which began in the first half of we believe our customers have elected to defer purchases of this type of merchandise  however  we have new merchant management in place for this category and intend to focus our efforts on the brand names and value propositions that have been successful in other merchandise categories 
the other category sales decline is primarily due to lower sales of toys principally in the latter half of the year  when toys represent a relatively larger portion of our total net sales 
the lower toys sales results were partially offset within the other category by higher sales driven by closeout deals of licensed kids underwear during the first half of the year 
the seasonal category net sales produced positive results in the first half of the year for lawn garden and summer merchandise  however  the second half of the year s net sales underperformed due to lower comparable store sales for christmas  halloween  and harvest 
because the christmas selling season represents a higher portion of the total year s sales in this category  the decline in christmas merchandise sales drove the category sales lower for the year 
gross margin gross margin dollars increased million to  million in compared to  million in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the increase in gross margin dollars was principally due to the higher gross margin rate  which increased gross margin dollars by approximately million 
partially offsetting the higher gross margin rate was lower net sales of million  which reduced gross margin dollars by approximately million 
the gross margin rate increase of basis points was primarily due to higher initial markup on merchandise and favorable shrink results partially offset by higher markdowns and the mix impact of our higher net sales in merchandise categories  such as consumables  that have lower gross margin rates 
the improvement in initial markup was due in part to a drugstore liquidation deal  a furniture closeout from a large national brand  and an overall favorable deal environment for closeout merchandise 
in addition  initial markup was higher in due to our home event  which we offered in our stores principally during the first half of the year 
the home event merchandise was included in the furniture category and home category 
shrink was lower principally due to favorable physical inventory results 
higher markdowns were attributable in part to planned markdowns associated with a drugstore liquidation deal  a furniture closeout from a large national brand  and our home event merchandise 
our inventory turnover improved to turns in compared to turns in based on historical results and current economic conditions  we expect our gross margin rate to be approximately 
based on the current general economic trends  our vendors may be negatively impacted by insufficient availability of credit to fund their operations or insufficient demand for their products  which may affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us 
additionally  the general economic conditions have caused a higher level of uncertainty of our forecasted sales results  and thus  demand for our merchandise could differ materially from our expectation causing us to under or over buy certain merchandise  which may result in customer dissatisfaction or excessive markdowns required to liquidate the merchandise 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million to  million in compared to  million in the increase in selling and administrative expenses was principally caused by an increase in medical plan expenses of million  higher share based compensation expense of million  the partial recovery of the hcc note investment of million see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the hcc note  the reduction in selling and administrative expenses due to the receipt of insurance proceeds for hurricane claims of million  and higher store utilities of million 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in distribution and outbound transportation costs and a million decrease in store payroll costs 
the increase in medical plan expenses is principally due to higher paid claims 
the increase in share based compensation is principally due to our adoption of sfas no 
r under the modified prospective method of accounting in the first quarter of and our acceleration of vesting of stock options in the fourth quarter of we expect share based compensation expense to increase in due to the continued increase in unvested options expected to be outstanding  however  this impact is expected to level off after because the stock options that have been granted since vest over a four year period 
higher store utilities costs were driven by colder weather this winter and higher average commodity rates throughout the majority of the decline in distribution and outbound transportation costs is a result of lower inventory levels  fewer cartons processed through our distribution centers as discussed above  more one way trips to the stores resulting in higher shipping cost per mile but fewer miles traveled and  beginning in july  the integration of our ohio furniture distribution operation into four of our regional distribution centers 
partially offsetting these favorable distribution and outbound transportation costs was the impact of higher diesel fuel prices 
store payroll is lower due to fewer stores and employees and fewer cartons of merchandise resulting from the million decline in net sales and the merchandise strategy that involves offering merchandise with slightly higher average item retails 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in excluding the impact of the million partial recovery of the hcc note and the receipt of hurricane insurance proceeds of million  both of which reduced selling and administrative expenses  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been approximately flat in compared to our future selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales rate is dependent upon many factors including our level of net sales  our ability to implement additional efficiencies  principally in our store and distribution center operations  and fluctuating commodity prices  such as diesel fuel  which directly affects our outbound transportation cost 
based on our expectation of flat to a decline of for comparable store sales in  we expect selling and administrative expenses to increase in as a percent of sales  principally as a result of the impact of our fixed costs such as rent  employee salaries  insurance  and benefits over flat to lower sales dollars 
as stated in the discussion of our operating expense strategy above  we expect lower distribution and outbound transportation costs in the first half of  when compared to the first half of  due to the integration of the ohio furniture distribution center into four of our regional distribution centers 
the full quarterly effect of this reduction in cost did not occur until the third quarter of we believe we have additional opportunities for future reductions in selling and administrative expenses in store operations and supply chain  which may offset other inflationary factors 
during  we experienced volatility in the price of diesel fuel  which drove our costs higher than expected for the first three quarters and lower than expected for the fourth quarter 
based on current diesel fuel costs  we expect this element of our selling and administrative expenses will be lower in the first quarter of because the current price of diesel fuel is lower than the price of diesel fuel in the first quarter of we expect the de leveraging impact of flat to negative comparable store sales to be greater than the favorable impact of the furniture integration and the lower diesel fuel cost factors in  resulting in our guidance of higher selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales for depreciation expense depreciation expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease was principally related to the five year service life store remodel program assets that were placed in service in and and a lower level of capital expenditures in and the lower capital expenditures in and are principally related to opening seven stores in and stores in compared to opening   and stores in   and  respectively 
in addition  in and  we took a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development and installation of a new point of sale register system  which was installed in approximately stores in and in all of our remaining stores in as a result of the installation of the new point of sale register system  we reduced the estimated remaining service life on our old register system  effective the fourth quarter of the impact of this service life reduction was to recognize million in and million in as additional depreciation expense associated with the old cash registers 
for  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million to million 
using this assumption and the run rate of depreciation on our existing property and equipment  we expect depreciation expense to be million to million  which would represent a decline from the million of depreciation expense in interest expense interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was principally due to higher average borrowings of million in compared to average borrowings of million in the higher average borrowings caused interest expense to be higher by approximately million 
the higher average borrowings were driven principally by the acquisition of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase programs 
our average effective interest rate of in was lower than our average effective interest rate of in the decrease in the average effective interest rate decreased our interest expense by approximately million in the lower interest rate was due to a decrease in libor  the base interest rate available to us under the credit agreement 
we anticipate lower average borrowings in as we began with borrowings under the credit agreement of million  which was million lower than the borrowings outstanding at the beginning of in addition  we expect cash provided by operating activities to be million to million  which is in excess of cash used for investing activities capital expenditures of million to million 
in  we expect to enter into a new bank credit agreement to replace the credit agreement 
because interest rate credit spreads have widened since we entered into the credit agreement  we may pay higher interest rates in the future under a new bank credit agreement  however  the current libor rate  which is a base rate available to us under the credit agreement and expected to be available to us under a new bank credit agreement prior to the application of the applicable credit spread  is approximately lower than the peak libor rate in we do not expect the higher credit spread under the new bank agreement to have a material adverse effect on our operating results in we expect interest expense to be lower in than because the estimated impact of the lower average borrowings is greater than the estimated impact of the higher interest rates 
interest and investment income interest and investment income decreased million in to million compared to million in the decline in interest and investment income was caused by the reduction in funds available to invest in compared to our average invested amount in was million compared to million in the decline in funds available for investment was caused by the million of share repurchases under our share repurchase programs during the period march through february in  we invested primarily in money market type investments that were considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds 
we did not hold any investment balances at the end of we expect to have higher average invested amounts in as result of the lower debt levels and expected cash provided by operating activities 
income taxes our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was for compared to for the net increase in was driven by a decrease in nontaxable municipal interest income  the increase in the valuation allowance on unrealized capital losses versus a net decrease in the valuation allowance in  and a change in the jurisdictional earnings mix  partially offset by the settlement of certain income tax matters 
we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be within a range of to 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations was million  net of tax  in compared to income from discontinued operations of million  net of tax in the loss from discontinued operations of million  net of tax  was comprised of million  net of tax  for the kb ii bankruptcy lease obligation as defined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and million  net of tax  for exit related costs on the remaining closed stores which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations 
kb toys declared bankruptcy again in december as a result of this bankruptcy filing  kb toys rejected store leases for which we believe we have an indemnification obligation 
based on the lease data for these stores and using our prior experience with these matters  we estimated a kb ii bankruptcy lease obligation of million  net of tax 
the income from discontinued operations in was principally comprised of the release of our kb i bankruptcy lease obligations of million  net of tax  the recognition of million of proceeds  net of tax  from the bankruptcy trust as recovery for prior charges incurred by us for kb i bankruptcy lease obligations and the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center formerly owned by kb toys mortgage guarantee  and exit related costs on the closed stores of million  net of tax  related to expenses on the portion of the stores where the leases have not been terminated 
compared to net sales net sales by merchandise category  as a percentage of total net sales  and net sales change in dollars and percentage in compared to were as follows change in thousands consumables    home    furniture    hardlines    seasonal    other    net sales    net sales decreased to  million in compared to  million in this net sales decrease of million is principally due to million of sales made during the rd week in combined with lower net sales of million resulting from fewer open stores  partially offset by a comparable store sales increase of  which increased net sales by million 
from a merchandise perspective  consumables  furniture  and seasonal were the best performing categories with comparable store sales increasing in the mid single digits range 
comparable store sales increases in these categories were partially offset by decreases in home and other 
consumables performed consistently throughout with positive comparable store sales across all departments 
we believe consumables experienced these results because our merchants continued to acquire widely recognized brand name merchandise that offered tremendous value to the customer 
furniture performed consistently throughout the first three quarters of  however  sales trends in the fourth quarter were more challenging in part because we were transitioning between old and new styles of merchandise in upholstery and case goods and a successful launch of serta mattresses occurred in the fourth quarter of seasonal was driven by strength in lawn garden  summer  and christmas  which was partially offset by disappointing halloween and harvest sales 
this was the second year in a row of favorable christmas results 
our lawn garden and summer business drove the favorable seasonal category performance in the first half of the net sales of the seasonal category in exemplify results produced by our merchandising strategy  as the quality and value proposition has increased significantly and the average item retail price has increased as well 
this supports one of the assumptions in our merchandising strategy that customers are willing to pay for quality and great value when they shop our stores 
home category sales were very soft following the positive performance in the first quarter of all home departments except for domestics ended with negative comparable store sales 
within the other category  the decrease in toy comparable store sales was partially offset by the impact from larger closeout deals  including a drugstore liquidation deal and a furniture deal 
similar to other retailers  our toy business was challenged in principally due to the negative publicity from certain high profile toy recalls 
merchandise from the drugstore liquidation deal was in about of our stores and was very similar to a drugstore deal that we had in the furniture deal was an opportunity for us to offer branded furniture in about  of our stores  just in time for the tax refund selling season  which historically is the highest volume period for sales of furniture 
the merchandise from the furniture deal was largely sold by the end of the first quarter of our future net sales results could fluctuate materially depending on the availability  timing  and or size of closeout deals 
gross margin gross margin dollars decreased to  million in compared to  million in the decline in gross margin by million was principally due to a combination of lower net sales of million and a lower gross margin rate of in compared to in the decline in net sales reduced gross margin dollars in by approximately million while the gross margin percentage of net sales decline of basis points reduced gross margin by approximately million 
this gross margin rate decrease of basis points was primarily due to higher markdowns  a shift in the sales mix toward lower margin categories  such as consumables  from higher margin categories or departments  such as the home category and the toys department  and higher accruals for shrink 
higher markdowns were attributable in part to slower selling categories and departments  such as the home category and the toys department  and more promotional selling in seasonal and furniture 
the factors decreasing the gross margin rate were partially offset by an improvement in the initial markup of merchandise purchased in compared to purchases in this improvement in initial markup is primarily attributed to our merchandising strategies as discussed in the above merchandising section under operating strategy 
our inventory turnover improved to turns in compared to turns in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million to  million in compared to  million in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in in  selling and administrative expenses were reduced by million basis points of proceeds from the kb toys bankruptcy trust see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information and million basis points of insurance proceeds as recovery for hurricane insurance claims 
in  selling and administrative expenses included charges of million basis points for the estimated settlement liability for the tentative settlements of two employment related civil class actions brought against us see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition to these specific items  the following items contributed to the basis point improvement in selling and administrative expense leverage the increase in comparable store sales  which was above our expense leverage point  a reduction in health and welfare plan expenses of million driven by greater discounts resulting from a change in the plan s service provider effective february  and fewer plan participants  a reduction in distribution and outbound transportation costs of million  and a reduction in store payroll and payroll related expense of million 
distribution and outbound transportation costs  which are included in selling and administrative expenses see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  decreased to million in compared to million in distribution and outbound transportation expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in distribution and outbound transportation cost savings have been achieved through certain management initiatives including  but not limited to  improvements in furniture distribution  more efficient scheduling of labor used in the distribution centers  lower health and welfare plan expense  as discussed above  and transportation initiatives aimed at optimizing the use of our transportation fleet and the increased usage of third party one way carriers 
the higher use of third party one way carriers  which began late in the second quarter of  has increased our cost per mile while decreasing the overall transportation cost as a result of fewer miles traveled 
store payroll continues to benefit from merchandising strategies such as acquiring more floor ready merchandise that has resulted in a reduction in payroll hours required to process fewer cartons and improved distribution methods 
depreciation expense depreciation expense declined million to million for compared to million for the decrease was principally related to the decline in capital expenditures over the last months compared to earlier fiscal years 
the lower capital expenditures are principally related to opening seven stores in and stores in compared to opening   and stores in   and  respectively 
for additional discussion and analysis of our real estate strategy  see the discussion above in the overview section of md a 
in addition  in and  we took a conservative approach to capital investments aimed primarily at the development and installation of a new point of sale register system  which was installed in approximately of our stores as of february   and other items generally considered maintenance capital items for our distribution centers and stores 
in  upon the successful completion of a pilot program in of our stores and the decision to move forward with the implementation of a new point of sale system in all of our stores  we reduced the remaining estimated service life on approximately million of certain point of sale equipment 
the impact of this service life reduction was to recognize approximately million in the fourth quarter of and million in as additional depreciation expense on the old cash registers 
interest expense interest expense increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was principally due to higher average outstanding borrowings of million in compared to average outstanding borrowings of million in the higher average borrowings were driven principally by the acquisition of approximately million shares of our common stock for million under our publicly announced share repurchase programs 
interest and investment income interest and investment income increased million in to million compared to million in because we began with cash and cash equivalents of million  we were in an invested position throughout the first half of we invested primarily in money market type investments that are considered cash equivalents and other short term high grade bond mutual funds 
income taxes our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was for compared to for the increase in was driven primarily by less benefit from valuation allowance reductions relating to net operating loss deferred tax assets and the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes 
discontinued operations we recorded income from discontinued operations of million in compared to million in the income from discontinued operations in was principally comprised of the release of our kb i bankruptcy lease obligations as defined in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of million  net of tax  the recognition of million of proceeds  net of tax  from the bankruptcy trust as recovery for prior charges incurred by us for kb i bankruptcy lease obligations and the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center formerly owned by kb toys mortgage guarantee  and exit related costs on the closed stores of million  net of tax  related to expenses on the portion of the stores where the leases have not been terminated 
the income from discontinued operations in was principally comprised of the partial release of our kb i bankruptcy lease obligations of million  net of tax  and the release of kb toys related income tax and sales tax indemnification liabilities of million  net of tax  which were partially offset by a loss on the sale of the pittsfield  massachusetts distribution center of approximately million  net of tax and exit related costs on the closed stores of million  net of tax  including a million pretax pension settlement charge and expenses on the portion of the stores where the leases had not been terminated 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations and  as necessary  borrowings under the credit agreement 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided by operations are impacted by net sales volume  seasonal sales patterns  and operating profit margins 
our net sales are typically highest during the nine weeks of christmas selling season during our fourth fiscal quarter 
generally our working capital requirements peak late in our third fiscal quarter or early in our fourth fiscal quarter 
we meet those needs typically with borrowings under the credit agreement  which terminates on october  at january   working capital was million  which included million for the current maturities of obligations under the credit agreement 
global capital and credit markets have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption 
despite this volatility and disruption  we believe that our operating cash flow  together with the credit agreement  will be adequate to meet current operating  investing and financing needs 
there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to replace  renew  extend or modify the credit agreement beyond its october termination date on commercially acceptable terms 
we expect to have a new bank credit agreement by the end of the second quarter of  however  we expect the cost of borrowing under the new bank credit agreement will be higher than the credit agreement and our borrowing capacity may be less than the million currently available to us under the credit agreement 
cash provided by operating activities declined in to million from million in and million in while operating profit margins have expanded from to  these improvements were more than offset with working capital changes 
during through  our inventories declined resulting in cash provided by operations of million 
the majority of the decline in inventories occurred in and increased our cash from operations by million 
in and the inventory decline only resulted in million and million of cash from operations  respectively 
the decline in inventories was driven by lower average store inventory and lower store count each year 
the decline in average store inventory was more pronounced in as a result of our merchandising and operating strategies that resulted in an improved turnover rate of our inventories which increased from turns in to turns in along with delayed timing of merchandise replenishments 
comparatively  during through  our accounts payable increased resulting in cash provided by operations of million 
our accounts payable leverage was most pronounced in when we benefited from an increase of million in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts payable in was driven by our efforts to improve our terms with our vendors 
accounts payable declined in principally due to lower inventory in compared to  and a shift in our merchandise mix to purchases from vendors with shorter payment terms  many of whom offer us discounts 
our cash paid for income taxes was million  million and million during   and  respectively 
the increases in income taxes paid were a direct result of higher operating profits and partly impacted by the timing of required tax payments relative to the fiscal years in which these profits were earned 
additionally  in  we benefited from larger tax deductions caused by our employees exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock 
in  we contributed million to the pension plan 
these contributions were made principally as a result of the decline in market value of the pension plan s investments resulting from the general economic conditions 
we do not expect to have any required contributions to the pension plan in  however  we may choose to make discretionary contributions 
based on assumptions about our operating performance that we have discussed above in md a  we expect cash provided by operating activities to be approximately million to million in however  based on the current general economic conditions  consumers may elect to defer or forego purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news 
reduced consumer spending may reduce our net sales  which could lower our profitability and limit our ability to convert merchandise inventories to cash 
cash used in investing activities increased in to million from million in and million in these changes were caused by the increase in capital expenditures each year 
in  our capital expenditures were limited principally to maintenance type capital related to various store  distribution center  and lease related requirements  as well as capital related to opening new stores  and software development costs for our new point of sale register system 
in  our capital expenditures were higher principally due to the installation of the new point of sale register system in approximately of our stores and for approximately store retrofits to better feature some of our key merchandise growth classifications 
in  we completed the installation of new cash registers in all of our stores and capital expenditures were higher than the prior year principally as a result of licensing and development associated with our sap for retail system implementation  the acquisition of two store properties that we were previously leasing and new store openings 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million to million in  comprised principally of maintenance capital of approximately million  real estate capital of approximately million driven by our plan to open new stores  and other capital of million to million which includes  among other things  our continued software development of the sap for retail system 
cash used in financing activities was driven by the repurchase of shares of our common stock under various share repurchase programs approved by our board of directors 
we acquired million  million and million of our outstanding common shares in   and  respectively under these programs 
the common share repurchases were funded with cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under the credit agreement 
our net borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement have fluctuated during the past three years 
in  we repaid our beginning of the year outstanding borrowings of million and ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of million 
in  principally due to the million of shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs  we ended the year with outstanding borrowings of million 
during  we paid million to reduce our outstanding borrowings and ended the year with million outstanding under the credit agreement 
the proceeds of the credit agreement are available for general corporate purposes  working capital  and to repay certain of our indebtedness 
the pricing and fees related to the credit agreement fluctuate based on our debt rating 
a downgrade in our credit rating could raise our cost of borrowing under the credit agreement 
loans made under the credit agreement may be prepaid by us without penalty 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to  limitations on indebtedness  liens  and investments  as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
a violation of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement  which would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the credit agreement for loans and letters of credit  and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans under the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the credit agreement  as amended  at january  the credit agreement permits  at our option  borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or the london interbank offering rate plus applicable margin 
the credit agreement also permits  as applicable  borrowings at various interest rate options mutually agreed upon by us and the lenders 
whenever our liquidity position requires us to borrow funds under the credit agreement  we typically repay and or borrow on a daily basis 
the daily activity is a net result of our liquidity position  which is generally driven by the following components of our operations cash inflows such as cash or credit card receipts collected from stores for merchandise sales and other miscellaneous deposits  and cash outflows such as check clearings for the acquisition of merchandise  payroll and other operating expenses  wire and other electronic transactions for merchandise purchases  income and other taxes  employee benefits  and other miscellaneous disbursements 
in addition to revolving credit loans  the credit agreement includes a million swing loan sub limit  a million bid loan sub limit  and a million letter of credit sub limit 
we had borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement of million and million at january  and february   respectively 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was at january  and at february  the borrowings available under the credit agreement  after taking into account the outstanding borrowings and the reduction of availability resulting from outstanding letters of credit totaling million  were million at january  we use the credit agreement  as necessary  to provide funds for ongoing and seasonal working capital  capital expenditures  share repurchase programs  and other expenditures 
in addition  we use the credit agreement to provide letters of credit for various operating and regulatory requirements  a significant portion of which consists of letters of credit required as a result of our self funded insurance programs 
given the seasonality of our business  the amount of borrowings under the credit agreement may fluctuate materially depending on various factors  including our operating financial performance  the time of year  and our need to increase merchandise inventory levels prior to the peak selling season 
we anticipate total indebtedness under the facility will be less than million through the end of may as discussed further in this form k  item a 
risk factors  the recent events that have occurred in the financial and credit markets continue to add a high level of uncertainty to factors which may affect our results of operations  capital resources  and liquidity  as well as credit availability to our vendors and customers 
based in part on discussions we have had with our key banking relationships  we currently believe that we have the ability to obtain financing beyond the termination of the credit agreement 
based on current market conditions and discussions that we have had with our key banking relationships  we may not be able to replace the entire million of availability with a new agreement 
however  we expect to be able to obtain a sufficient level of financing such that our normal operations are not impacted 
because interest rate credit spreads have widened since we entered into the credit agreement  we may pay higher interest rates in the future under a new bank credit agreement  however  the current libor rate  which is a base rate available to us under the credit agreement and expected to be available to us under a new bank credit agreement prior to the application of the applicable credit spread  is approximately lower than the peak libor rate in we do not expect the higher credit spread under the new bank agreement to have a material adverse effect on our operating results in based on historical and planned financial results  we believe that we have or  if necessary  have the ability to obtain  adequate resources to fund ongoing and seasonal working capital requirements  proposed capital expenditures  new projects  and currently maturing obligations 
other than the recent events that have occurred in the financial and credit markets and the scheduled termination of the credit agreement in october  we are not currently aware of any other trends  events  demands  commitments  or uncertainties which reasonably can be expected to have a material impact on our capital resources or liquidity 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under our contractual obligations at january  payments due by period less than more than total year to years to years years in thousands obligations under bank credit facility   operating lease obligations    capital lease obligations    purchase obligations     other long term liabilities     total contractual obligations   the disclosure of contractual obligations in this table is based on assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable as of the date of this report 
those assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate  consequently  the amounts provided in the table may differ materially from those amounts that we ultimately incur 
variables that may cause the stated amounts to vary from those actually incurred include  but are not limited to the termination of a contractual obligation prior to its stated or anticipated expiration  fees or damages incurred as a result of the premature termination or breach of a contractual obligation  the acquisition of more or less services or goods under a contractual obligation than are anticipated by us as of the date of this report  fluctuations in third party fees  governmental charges  or market rates that we are obligated to pay under contracts we have with certain vendors  and the exercise of renewal options under  or the automatic renewal of  contracts that provide for the same 
obligations under bank credit facility consist of the borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
in addition  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million at january  approximately million of the outstanding letters of credit represent stand by letters of credit and we do not expect to meet conditions requiring significant cash payments on these letters of credit  accordingly  they have been excluded from this table 
the remaining outstanding letters of credit represent commercial letters of credit whereby the related obligation is included in purchase obligations 
for a further discussion  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations include  among other items  leases for retail stores  warehouse space  data center  offices  and certain computer and other business equipment 
the future minimum commitments for store  data center  office  and warehouse space operating leases are million 
for a discussion of leases  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
many of the store lease obligations require us to pay for our applicable portion of common area maintenance costs cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
in connection with our store lease obligations  we estimated that future obligations for cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance were million at january  we have made certain assumptions and estimates in order to account for our contractual obligations relative to cam  real estate taxes  and property insurance 
those assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to use of historical data to estimate our future obligations  calculation of our obligations based on comparable store averages where no historical data is available for particular leasehold  and assumptions related to average expected increases over historical data 
the remaining lease obligation of million relates primarily to operating leases for computer and other business equipment 
for purposes of the lease and purchase obligation disclosures  we have assumed that we will make all payments scheduled or reasonably estimated to be made under those obligations that have a determinable expiration date  and we disregarded the possibility that such obligations may be prematurely terminated or extended  whether automatically by the terms of the obligation or by agreement between us and the counterparty  due to the speculative nature of premature termination or extension 
where an operating lease or purchase obligation is subject to a month to month term or another automatically renewing term  we disclosed in the table our minimum commitment under such obligation  such as one month in the case of a month to month obligation and the then current term in the case of another automatically renewing term  due to the uncertainty of future decisions to exercise options to extend or terminate any existing leases 
purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for merchandise issued in the ordinary course of our business that are valued at million  the entirety of which represents obligations due within one year of january  in addition  we have a purchase commitment for future inventory purchases totaling million at january  while we are not required to meet any periodic minimum purchase requirements under this commitment  for purposes of this tabular disclosure  we have included the value of the purchases that we anticipate making during each of the reported periods  as purchases that will count toward our fulfillment of the aggregate obligation 
the remaining million of purchase obligations is primarily related to distribution and transportation  information technology  print advertising  energy procurement  and other store security  supply  and maintenance commitments 
other long term liabilities include million for expected pension plan contributions  our million obligation related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan  million for unrecognized tax benefits  and million for closed store lease termination costs 
pension contributions are equal to expected benefit payments for the nonqualified plan plus expected contributions to the qualified plan using actuarial estimates and assuming that we only make the minimum required contributions see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about our employee benefit plans 
we have estimated the payments due by period for the nonqualified deferred compensation plan based on an average of historical distributions 
we have included unrecognized tax benefits of million for payments expected in and million of fin no 
timing related items anticipated to reverse in unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments 
our closed store lease termination cost payments are based on contractual terms 
the obligations disclosed in this table are exclusive of the contingent liabilities  guarantees  and indemnities related to kb toys 
for further discussion  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements for a discussion of the kb bankruptcy lease obligations  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
because the kb toys business filed for bankruptcy again in december and liquidated all of its store operations  we accrued a contingent liability on our balance sheet in the amount of million for kb toys store leases for which we may have an indemnification or guarantee obligation 
because of uncertainty inherent in the assumptions used to estimate this liability  our estimated liability could ultimately prove to be understated and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions creates a level of uncertainty with respect to reported or disclosed amounts in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  judgments  and assumptions  including those that management considers critical to the accurate presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates  judgments  and assumptions on historical experience  current trends  and various other factors that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the inherent uncertainty in using estimates  judgments  and assumptions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following assumptions and estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost retail inventory method 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price at or near the end of the reporting period 
the average cost retail inventory method requires management to make judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of markdowns to clear slow moving inventory  the estimated allowance for shrinkage  and the estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and prior or future gross margin 
these estimates are based on historical experience and current information 
when management determines the salability of merchandise inventories is diminished  markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded at the time the price change decision is made 
factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences and age of merchandise  as well as seasonal trends 
timing of holidays within fiscal periods  weather  and customer preferences could cause material changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year 
the inventory allowance for shrinkage is recorded as a reduction to inventories  charged to cost of sales  and calculated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period 
such estimates are based on our historical and current year experience based on a sample of recent physical inventory results 
independent physical inventory counts are taken at each store once a year  and typically the majority of these counts occur during january through april 
because only a sampling of our stores are counted prior to making our fiscal year end shrink estimate  we rely on the results of these sample stores along with our historical results to estimate our fiscal year end shrink accrual 
during the first fiscal quarter  the majority of the physical inventories are completed and actual results are recorded on a store by store basis 
in addition  we evaluate our go forward shrink accrual rate based on the results of the completed physical inventories 
at january   a difference in our shrink reserve would have affected gross margin  operating profit and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  we have loss prevention programs and policies aimed at minimizing shrinkage 
long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment 
we perform annual impairment reviews of our long lived assets at the store level 
when we perform the annual impairment reviews  we first determine which stores had impairment indicators present 
we use actual historical cash flows to determine which stores had negative cash flows in each of the past two years on a rolling basis 
for each store with two years of negative cash flows  we obtain future cash flow estimates based on operating performance estimates specific to each store s operations that are based on assumptions currently being used to develop our company level operating plans 
if the net book value of a store s long lived assets is not recoverable by the expected future cash flows of the store  we estimate the fair value of the store s assets and recognize an impairment charge for the excess net book value of the store s long lived assets over their fair value 
the fair value of store assets is estimated based on information available in the marketplace for similar assets 
we recognized impairment charges of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we believe that our impairment charges are trending lower because we closed a number of underperforming stores at the end of  and continued to close primarily through non renewal of leases underperforming stores in  and we only identified seven stores with impairment indicators as a result of our annual store impairment tests in and we recognized impairment charges on six of those stores 
therefore  we do not believe that varying the assumptions used to test for recoverability to estimate fair value of our long lived assets would have a material impact on the impairment charges we incurred in however  if our future operating results decline significantly  we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material see item a  risk factors  for additional discussion of this risk 
in addition to our annual store impairment reviews  we evaluate our long lived assets at each reporting period to determine whether impairment indicators are present 
in  we recorded impairment to the assets of one store as a result of a casualty loss due to hurricane damage 
the amount of this impairment is included in the million impairment charge discussed above 
share based compensation we grant stock options and performance based nonvested restricted stock to our employees under shareholder approved incentive plans 
share based compensation expense was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in share based compensation expense in each of the last three years is principally due to our adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of  when we began recognizing expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the fair value of stock options 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we accelerated the vesting of certain stock options  but not those granted after february   in order to reduce future expense on these options 
the majority of our stock options granted in and subsequent years vest on a pro rata basis over a four year period 
assuming that we grant a similar number of stock options in to the number we granted in  we would expect share based compensation expense to increase in  to reflect the additional options outstanding that have unrecognized compensation expense 
because is the fourth year of expensing stock options and the majority of our stock options vest on a pro rata basis over four years  we do not expect the number of unvested options to continue to increase beyond unless the number of stock options granted increases in the future 
future share based compensation expense for stock options is dependent upon the number and terms of future stock option awards and many estimates  judgments and assumptions used in arriving at the fair value of stock options 
future expense related to stock options may vary materially from currently amortizing options 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using a binomial model 
the binomial model takes into account estimates  assumptions  and judgments about our stock price volatility  our dividend yield rate  the risk free rate of return  the contractual term of the option  the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life  and the probability of retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
expected volatility is based on historical and current implied volatilities from traded options on our common shares 
the dividend yield rate on our common shares is assumed to be zero since we have not paid dividends and have no immediate plans to do so 
the risk free rate is based on us treasury security yields at the time of the grant 
the expected life is determined from the application of the binomial model and includes assumptions such as the expected employee exercise behavior and our expected turnover rate  which is based on analysis of historical data 
compensation expense for performance based nonvested restricted stock awards is recorded over the estimated vesting period based on the estimated achievement date of the performance criteria 
an estimated target achievement date is determined at the time of the award based on historical and forecasted performance of similar measures 
we monitor the achievement of the performance targets at each reporting period and make adjustments to the estimated vesting period when our internal models indicate that the estimated achievement date differs from the date being used to amortize expense 
any change in the estimated vesting date results in a prospective change to the related expense by charging the remaining unamortized expense over the remaining expected vesting period at the date the estimate was changed 
on the grant date of the restricted stock awards  we estimated a three year period for vesting based on the assumed achievement of the higher financial performance objective 
in the second quarter of  we changed the estimated achievement date from three years to two years as a result of our performance being better than expected  resulting in million and million of incremental expense in and  respectively 
we achieved the higher financial performance objective for the awards based on the results  and accordingly  these awards will vest on the first trading date following the filing of this report 
on the grant date of the restricted stock awards  we estimated a three year period for vesting based on the assumed achievement of the higher financial performance objective 
in the second quarter of  we changed the estimated achievement date for the higher financial performance objective from three years to two years due to better operating results than initially anticipated  resulting in million of incremental expense in in the fourth quarter of  we changed the estimated achievement date for the higher financial performance objective from two years to three years due to our declining net sales results which were in part due to the general economic conditions in the united states 
income taxes the determination of our income tax expense  refunds receivable  income taxes payable  deferred tax assets and liabilities and financial statement recognition  de recognition and or measurement of uncertain tax benefits for positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex accounting and multi jurisdictional income tax laws 
the effective income tax rate in any period may be materially impacted by the overall level of income loss before income taxes  the jurisdictional mix and magnitude of income loss  changes in the income tax laws which may be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year  subsequent recognition  de recognition and or measurement of an uncertain tax benefit in accordance with fin no 
 changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and adjustments of a deferred tax asset or liability for enacted changes in tax laws or rates 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence including recent financial results  projected future pretax accounting income from continuing operations and tax planning strategies when necessary 
this evaluation requires us to make assumptions that require significant judgment about the forecasts of future pretax accounting income 
the assumptions that we use in this evaluation are consistent with the assumptions and estimates used to develop our consolidated operating financial plans 
if we determine that a portion of our deferred tax assets  which principally represent expected future deductions or benefits  are not likely to be realized  we recognize a valuation allowance for our estimate of these benefits which we believe are not likely recoverable 
additionally  changes in tax laws  apportionment of income for state tax purposes  and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets 
in accordance with fin no 
 we evaluate the uncertainty of income tax positions taken or to be taken on income tax returns 
when a tax position meets the fin no 
more likely than not threshold  we recognize economic benefits associated with the position on our consolidated financial statements 
the more likely than not recognition threshold is a positive assertion that an enterprise believes it is entitled to economic benefits associated with a tax position 
when a tax position doesn t meet the more likely than not threshold  or in the case of those positions that do meet the threshold but are measured at less than the full benefit taken on the return  we recognize tax liabilities or de recognize tax assets  as the case may be 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have derecognized a tax benefit  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively or ultimately settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or as a result of the evaluation of new information that becomes available 
pension actuarial valuations are used to calculate the estimated expenses and obligations for our pension plans 
inherent in the actuarial valuations are several assumptions including discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
we review external data and historical trends to help determine the discount rate and expected long term rate of return 
our objective in selecting a discount rate is to identify the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations would be settled on the measurement date 
in making this estimate  we review rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes a review of the bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is derived from detailed periodic studies  which include a review of asset allocation strategies  anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  risks standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plan s asset mix 
while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  the assumption is primarily a long term  prospective rate of return 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost for is 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase net periodic pension cost by million 
the long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic pension cost in is 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost by million 
we recognized a charge of million  net of tax  to other comprehensive income in  principally as a result of the decline in value of investments held by the pension trust 
as of january   the accumulated other comprehensive income amount  which was principally unrealized actuarial loss  was million  net of tax 
during  we reclassified million  pretax  from other comprehensive income to expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
during  and in future periods  we expect to reclassify approximately million from other comprehensive income to expense  assuming we achieve our estimated rate of return on pension plan investments in future periods 
additionally  in the event that we have future settlement events  as occurred in and  we would expect that the expense related to future settlements would be greater than the million and million charges in and  respectively 
insurance and insurance related reserves we are self insured for certain losses relating to property  general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical and dental benefit claims  a portion of which is funded by employees 
we purchase stop loss coverage from third party insurance carriers to limit individual or aggregate loss exposure in these areas 
accrued insurance liabilities and related expenses are based on actual claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimated loss accruals for claims incurred but not paid are determined by applying actuarially based calculations taking into account historical claims payment results and known trends such as claims frequency and claims severity 
management makes estimates  judgments  and assumptions with respect to the use of these actuarially based calculations  including but not limited to  estimated health care cost trends  estimated lag time to report and pay claims  average cost per claim  network utilization rates  network discount rates  and other factors 
a change in our self insured liabilities at january  would have affected selling and administrative expenses  operating profit  and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
general liability and workers compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value  using a discount rate  while other liabilities for insurance reserves are not discounted 
a change in the discount rate on these liabilities would have affected selling and administrative expenses  operating profit  and income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
lease accounting in order to recognize rent expense on our leases  we evaluate many factors to identify the lease term such as the contractual term of the lease  our assumed possession date of the property  renewal option periods  and the estimated value of leasehold improvement investments that we are required to make 
based on this evaluation  our lease term is typically the minimum contractually obligated period over which we have control of the property
