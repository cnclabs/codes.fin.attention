item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  market and distribute software to simplify and accelerate the development  deployment  integration and management of business applications 
our mission is to deliver superior software products and services that increase business effectiveness by empowering our partners and customers to dramatically improve application development  deployment  integration and management 
our products include development tools  databases  application servers  messaging servers  complex event processing tools  enterprise service buses  application management tools  data connectivity products and integration products that enable the highly distributed deployment of responsive applications across internal networks  the internet and occasionally connected users 
through our various operating units  we market our products globally to a broad range of organizations in manufacturing  distribution  finance  retail  healthcare  telecommunications  government and many other fields 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations 
these operations are primarily conducted in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar significantly impact our results of operations 
in the first half of fiscal  the strengthening of the us dollar against most major currencies  primarily the euro  the british pound and the brazilian real  negatively affected the translation of our operating results into us dollars 
from the second half of fiscal to the end of the first half of fiscal  the weakening of the us dollar against most major currencies positively affected the translation of our operating results into us dollars 
in the second half of fiscal  the strengthening of the us dollar against most major currencies negatively affected the translation of our operating results into us dollars 
for fiscal  we had five operating units comprised of the openedge and soa group  which focuses on the openedge platform and soa infrastructure products  the apama division  which focuses on the apama product line and algorithmic trading for capital markets  the dataxtend division  which focuses on the dataxtend product line  datadirect technologies which focuses on the connect and shadow product lines  and the easyask division 
we had two operating units which met the requirements for separate disclosure the openedge and soa group and datadirect technologies 
the other three operating segments are below the threshold for separate disclosure and are included in the other segment 
with the acquisition of iona in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have reorganized into four business units for fiscal openedge which includes the progress openedge and progress easyask product lines  apama which includes the progress apama product lines  integration infrastructure which includes the progress sonic  progress actional  orbix  artix and fuse product lines  and data infrastructure which includes the datadirect connect  datadirect shadow  progress dataxtend and progress objectstore product lines 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we will realign our disclosures to conform to this new business unit structure 
in fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of xcalia sa xcalia in february  mindreef  inc mindreef in june and iona in september we did not make any acquisitions in fiscal in fiscal year  we completed a number of acquisitions  including actional corporation actional in january  neon systems  inc neon in january  pantero corporation in june  and openaccess software inc in november these acquisitions were designed to expand the size and breadth of our business and or add complementary products and technologies to existing product sets 
during  we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions designed to expand our business and or add complimentary products and technologies to our existing product sets 
we believe that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  lease commitments  debt payments and other long term obligations through at least the next twelve months 
to the extent that we complete any future acquisitions  our cash position could be reduced 
we see the most significant risks for to be the macroeconomic climate  which could cause our customers to delay  forego or reduce the amount of their investments in our products or delay payments of amounts due to us  and the decline in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  the british pound and the brazilian real  which will adversely affect our reported results as amounts earned in other countries are translated into dollars for reporting purposes 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect 
table of contents the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting results of operations 
in determining when to recognize revenue from a customer arrangement  we are often required to exercise judgment regarding the application of our accounting policies to a particular arrangement 
for example  judgment is required in determining whether a customer arrangement has multiple elements 
when such a situation exists  judgment is also involved in determining whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
while we follow specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  we make and use significant management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above  as well as collectibility 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different estimates  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we would require additional provisions for doubtful accounts that would increase bad debt expense 
goodwill and intangible assets we had goodwill and net intangible assets of million at november  we assess the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that the fair value of such assets was less than the carrying value 
judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price or in the value of one of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
we utilize either discounted cash flow models or other valuation models to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in those models 
different assumptions and judgment determinations could yield different conclusions that would result in an impairment charge to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
income tax accounting we had a net deferred tax asset of million at november  we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider scheduled reversals of temporary differences  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 
if we were to change our assumptions or otherwise determine that we were unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
on december   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
management judgment is required in evaluating whether a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  based on the weight of available evidence  indicates that it is more likely than not that  on an evaluation of the technical merits  the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
management judgment is also required in measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the amount accrued for uncertain tax positions would occur 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
under sfas r  stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the relevant service period 
we estimate the fair value of each stock based award on the measurement date using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black 
table of contents scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility  the expected life of options  a risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
many of these assumptions are highly subjective and require the exercise of management judgment 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the amount of stock based compensation would occur 
investments in debt securities we have approximately million at par value in investments related to auction rate securities ars  all of which are classified as noncurrent at november  for each of our ars  we evaluate the risks related to the structure  collateral and liquidity of the investment  and forecast the probability of issuer default  auction failure and a successful auction at par  or a redemption at par  for each future auction period 
based on the results of this assessment  we record either a temporary impairment charge in accumulated other comprehensive income or an other than temporary impairment charge in other income in our statement of operations 
accordingly  we recorded a temporary impairment charge of million at november  to reduce the value of our ars classified as available for sale securities 
for ars acquired as part of the acquisition of iona and classified as trading securities  we record all changes in fair value in current period earnings 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge to earnings of million to reduce the value of our ars classified as trading securities 
for further information regarding the ars acquired as part of the acquisition of iona  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k 
if we used different assumptions and judgment determinations or the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of our available for sale ars through an other than temporary impairment charge in current period earnings

acquisition related expenses 
acquisition related expenses for fiscal include million of expenses for retention bonuses to apama and easyask employees who joined us in fiscal and million of in process research and development from the acquisition of neon  which was expensed when the acquisition was consummated because the technological feasibility of several products under development at the time of the acquisition had not been achieved and no alternate future uses had been established 
the value of in process research and development was determined based on an appraisal from an independent third party 
there were no such amounts in fiscal income from operations 
income from operations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of total revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in income from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to improved profitability in each of our reportable segments 
other income 
other income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily related to an increase in interest income  resulting from higher interest rates and higher average cash and short term investment balances  and lower foreign exchange losses 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the utilization of research and development credits in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  our cash and short term investments totaled million 
the decrease of million since the end of fiscal resulted primarily from cash used for acquisitions  purchases of our common stock  and the reclassification of ars to noncurrent investments see below  partially offset by cash generated from operations 
in addition to the million of cash and short term investments  we had million in investments related to ars that are classified as noncurrent 
our ars are floating rate securities with longer term maturities that are marketed by financial institutions with auction reset dates at primarily or day intervals to provide short term liquidity 
the remaining contractual maturities of these securities range from to years 
the underlying collateral of the ars consist of municipal bonds  which are insured by monoline insurance companies  and student loans  which are supported by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program ffelp and by the monoline insurance companies 
beginning in february  auctions for these securities began to fail  and the interest rates for these ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering document 
at february   our ars investments totaled million 
during the last three quarters of fiscal  investments totaling million were either redeemed at par by the issuer or sold at a successful auction 
this reduction in our ars investments was partially offset by an additional million par value of ars acquired as part of the acquisition of iona  resulting in a net reduction of the par value of our ars investments to million 
for each of the ars remaining in our portfolio  we evaluated the risks related to the structure  collateral and liquidity of the investment  and forecasted the probability of issuer default  auction failure and a successful auction at par or a redemption at par for each future auction period 
the weighted average cash flow for each period was then discounted back to present value for each security 
based on this methodology  we determined that the fair value of our ars investments is million  and we recorded a temporary impairment charge in accumulated other comprehensive income of million to reduce the value of our available for sale ars investments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge to earnings of million to reduce the value of our ars investments classified as trading securities  offset by a similar gain on the put option related to the ars rights offering discussed below 
with the exception of the ars acquired as part of the acquisition of iona discussed below  we will not be able to access these remaining funds until a future auction for these ars is successful  we sell the securities in a secondary market  or they are redeemed by the issuer 
as such  these remaining investments currently lack short term liquidity and are therefore classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet at november  ars were classified as current assets at november  based on our cash and short term investments balance of million and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate the 
table of contents lack of liquidity associated with these ars to adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability to hold the affected securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period 
therefore  the impairment on these securities is considered only temporary in nature 
if the credit rating of either the security issuer or the third party insurer underlying the investments deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the ars through an impairment charge 
in november  we accepted a settlement offer in the form of a rights offering from ubs financial services ubs  the investment firm that brokered the original purchases of the million par value of ars that we acquired as part of the acquisition of iona  which will provide us with the option the put option to sell these securities at par value to ubs during a period beginning on june  since the settlement agreement is a legally enforceable firm commitment  the put option is recognized as a financial asset at fair value in our financial statements at november   and accounted for separately from the associated securities 
the fair value of the put option is based on the difference in value between the par value and the fair value of the associated ars 
we have elected to measure the put option at its fair value pursuant to sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  and subsequent changes in fair value will also be recognized in current period earnings 
since we intend to exercise the put option in june  we do not have the intent to hold the associated auction rate securities until recovery or maturity 
therefore  we have classified these securities as trading pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  which requires changes in the fair value of these securities to be recorded in current period earnings  which we believe will substantially offset changes in the fair value of the put option 
we generated cash from operations of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the components of our cash flows from operations for fiscal years  and are as follows in thousands year ended november  net income depreciation  amortization and other noncash charges tax benefit from stock plans changes in operating assets and liabilities total the fluctuation in the change in operating assets and liabilities between fiscal and fiscal and between fiscal and fiscal was primarily the result of differences in the timing of maintenance renewal billings 
gross accounts receivable at november  decreased by million from the end of fiscal the decrease was primarily due to increased collections and the impact of exchange rates  partially offset by the result of higher revenue 
days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable decreased year over year by one day to days at the end of fiscal as compared to days at the end of fiscal and days at the end of fiscal we target a dso range of to days 
we purchased million of property and equipment in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the amount for fiscal included the purchase of a building adjacent to our headquarters for million 
the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal was due to lower capital expenditures associated with our erp implementation as the project was substantially completed in early the remaining amounts in each fiscal year consisted primarily of computer equipment  software and building and leasehold improvements 
we financed these purchases primarily from cash generated from operations 
we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock for million in fiscal year   shares for million in fiscal year  and  shares for million in fiscal year since beginning our stock repurchase program in  we have purchased and retired  shares at a cost of million 
in september  our board of directors authorized  for the period from october  through september   the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock  at such times and at such prices that we deem such purchases to be an effective use of cash 
in fiscal year  we completed three acquisitions

we include standard intellectual property indemnification provisions in our licensing agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to our product license agreements  we will indemnify  hold harmless  and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally business partners or customers  in connection with certain patent  copyright or other intellectual property infringement claims by third parties with respect to our products 
other agreements with our customers provide indemnification for claims relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from the performance of services by us or our subcontractors 
historically  our costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims relating to such indemnity agreements have been insignificant 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is immaterial 
we believe that existing cash balances together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our foreseeable cash requirements including planned capital expenditures  lease commitments  restructuring obligations  debt payments and other long term obligations through at least the next twelve months 
revenue backlog our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year 
table of contents licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
our backlog of orders not included on the balance sheet is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our basic financial statements 
our aggregate revenue backlog at november  was approximately million  of which million was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue  primarily related to unexpired maintenance and support contracts 
at november   the remaining amount of backlog of approximately million was composed of multi year licensing arrangements of approximately million and open software license orders received but not shipped of approximately million 
we typically fulfill most of our software license orders within days of acceptance of a purchase order 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize software license revenue upon shipment of the product  or if delivered electronically  when the customer has the right to access the software 
because there are many elements governing when revenue is recognized  including when orders are shipped  credit approval obtained  completion of internal control processes over revenue recognition and other factors  management has some control in determining the period in which certain revenue is recognized 
we frequently have open software license orders at the end of the quarter which have not shipped or have otherwise not met all the required criteria for revenue recognition 
although the amount of open software license orders may vary at any time  we generally do not believe that the amount  if any  of such software license orders at the end of a particular quarter is a reliable indicator of future performance 
in addition  there is no industry standard for the definition of backlog and there may be an element of estimation in determining the amount 
as such  direct comparisons with other companies may be difficult or potentially misleading 
contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
the following table details our contractual obligations as of november  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt interest payment on long term debt operating leases total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and have policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
our investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years or interest rate resets of less than days and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  we have classified all of our debt securities as available for sale  except for certain ars which are classified as trading 
the available for sale classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk if such investments are held until their maturity date because changes in fair value due to market changes in interest rates are recorded on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments and cash flows are immaterial 
we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  which exist as part of our on going business operations 
certain assets and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk 
our objective for holding derivatives is to eliminate or reduce the impact of these exposures 
we periodically monitor our foreign currency exposures to enhance the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  british pound  brazilian real  japanese yen and australian dollar 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes  nor do we hold or issue any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging 
table of contents activities sfas 
although these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings 
we generally use foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas to hedge a portion of forecasted international intercompany cash flows for up to one year in the future  with major us multinational banks as counterparties to the option contracts 
there were no outstanding foreign currency option contracts at november  compared to outstanding foreign currency option contracts with a fair value of million and a notional value of million at november  we also use forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we generally do not hedge the net assets of our international subsidiaries 
the unrealized losses  recorded in other income  of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were million at november   and million at november  the foreign exchange exposure from a movement of currency exchange rates would have a material impact on our revenue and net income 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in all foreign currency exchange rates  our revenue would be adversely affected by approximately and our net income would be adversely affected by approximately excluding any offsetting positive impact from our ongoing hedging programs  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
