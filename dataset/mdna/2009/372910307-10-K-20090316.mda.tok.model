item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company s customers are primarily international and domestic e p companies and state owned national oil companies 
demand for the company s seismic services depends upon the level of spending by these companies  which in turn has historically been dependent on the prices for oil and gas 
in the past  fluctuation in oil and gas prices has affected the demand for the company s services and its results of operations  and the company expects this to continue into the future 
the majority of exploration in north america is targeted at natural gas while international exploration is mostly focused on oil 
form k the company s management continually monitors industry trends and market conditions to enable it to best react as changes occur 
additionally  company s management consistently monitors and assesses the risk factors and opportunities that may affect the company 
more specifically  while demand for the company s services has increased significantly in recent years  the company continues to experience price competition in the marketplace which has prevented it from benefiting from significant increased pricing for its services 
in spite of this  the company has and will continue to aggressively compete for seismic projects from both existing and prospective customers 
in international markets  the company has seen increasing demand from state owned national oil companies nocs and believes changing global dynamics relative to the oil and gas industry will result in increased opportunities with the nocs and given its existing relationships  the company believes it is well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities 
the company also recognizes that the seismic industry is cyclical and through the acquisitions of trace energy services  ltd 
now known as geokinetics exploration  inc and grant geophysical  inc 
now known as geokinetics international  inc  the company has built a foundation for growth that is highly diversified and should be beneficial during times of contraction 
the company continues to focus on increasing its revenues and profitability by taking the following steps updating its technology and increasing its channel count per crew to allow it to compete for larger projects  which typically are more profitable  standardizing its equipment across its crews to allow them to move from country to country as conditions dictate and reduce crew downtime  lowering its general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues by reorganizing management and by increasing operational efficiencies  and invest in systems to standardize and automate processes 
recent developments net income in during  the company reported its first net income before preferred stock dividend and accretion costs in four years 
the losses in prior periods were caused primarily by non recurring costs related to its acquisitions in and and their related financings 
global economic recession and reduced oil and gas prices the united states and global economies are currently undergoing a recession 
the reduced economic activity associated with this recession has resulted in lower oil and gas prices 
in addition  natural gas production in the united states has increased as new technologies have allowed the successful exploration for and production of previously inaccessible gas deposits 
this has resulted in depressed prices for natural gas  which may remain depressed even if economic activity increases as the recession ends 
if oil and gas prices remain depressed  the company s clients are likely to reduce the amounts they spend on exploration and production activities  including its seismic data acquisition services 
the company has seen some contract cancellations and reduced demand in north america  however international demand remains strong 
disruption in the financial markets the global capital and financial markets are experiencing severe disruptions 
many financial institutions have liquidity concerns prompting intervention from governments 
the company s exposure to the disruptions in the financial markets include its credit facilities  its ability to access the capital markets and the safety of its cash investments 
its credit facility is committed until if the disruptions in the capital markets were to continue until then  replacement of the facility may be unavailable or more expensive 
difficulties in the credit markets may also cause the lenders under its credit facilities to be more restrictive in calculating the amounts available under those facilities 
the company s cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million on december   consist of cash deposits primarily with wells fargo bank and other local banks 
if one of these banks were to fail  the company could suffer losses 
in the past  the company has accessed the equity markets to finance growth 
the company s stock price  like the equity markets in general  has declined substantially over the last several months 
in addition  current disruptions in the financial markets have made it unlikely that the company could access the equity markets  unless conditions improve dramatically 
until these conditions improve  the company is unlikely to be able to access the public equity markets  which may limit the company s ability to pursue its growth strategy 
form k business the seismic services industry is dependent upon the spending levels of e p companies for exploration  development  exploitation and production of oil and natural gas 
these spending levels have traditionally been heavily influenced by the prices of oil and natural gas 
during the past three years  the oil and natural gas industry has seen significant increases in activity resulting from continuing high commodity prices for oil and natural gas 
the company s seismic data acquisition services segment has benefited from these increased levels of activity and from its reputation as a provider of high quality seismic surveys 
the company has seen its seismic data acquisition services revenues and operating margins improve over the past several years as a result of increased demand and improved pricing for its services  improved contract terms with its customers as well as the acquisitions of trace and grant 
however  oil and natural gas prices have recently seen a significant decline 
to the extent that the decline in oil and gas prices results in a decrease in oil and gas exploration activities  the company s cash flows from operations could be adversely affected 
if a global recession continues for an extended period of time  commodity prices may remain depressed for an extended period of time  which could reduce the company s revenues and cash flows  and adversely affect its growth strategy 
the company believes the following industry fundamentals will allow it to capture upside while managing for downside risk foreign state owned national oil companies are a primary driver for seismic growth seismic crew activity is still less than the lowest levels in the s when oil prices were near per barrel pressure for continued growth in activity  even if lower commodity prices exist oil companies are reloading prospect inventories resource plays are big drivers technical advances drive activity and create barriers to entry recent trends for more specialized crews and equipment desire to replace d data with d or d data improved processing drives demand for better data long term fundamentals are strong but the company is continually monitoring for trend toward overcapacity as of december   the company s core operating business segments were seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing and interpretation 
the company s corporate activities include its general and administrative functions 
results of operations summary of overall performance for during  the company experienced improved operating margins  income from operations and net income 
the data acquisition segment experienced substantial earnings growth and continued to provide a strong base of earnings and cash flow  both domestically and internationally 
the data processing and interpretation segment also contributed improved results

ebitda  as used and defined by the company  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income or loss  cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities  or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  the company s management believes ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating its operating performance because this measure is widely used by investors in the energy industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors  helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of the company s operations from period to period by removing the effect of the company s capital structure and asset base from its operating structure  and is used by the company s management for various purposes  including as a measure of operating performance  in presentations to the company s board of directors  as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting  and as a component for setting incentive compensation 
there are significant limitations to using ebitda as a measure of performance  including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non recurring items that materially affect the company s net income or loss  and the lack of comparability of results of operations of different companies

liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of cash have been cash flow generated by its seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing segments  debt and equity transactions  equipment financing and trade credit 
the company s primary uses of cash have been for operating expenses associated with its seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing segments  expenditures associated with upgrading and expanding the company s capital asset base and debt service 
the company s ability to maintain adequate cash balances is dependent upon future levels of demand for the services it provides to its customers 
available liquidity 
as of december   the company had available liquidity as follows total borrowing capacity under revolving credit facility million available cash million undrawn borrowing capacity under revolving credit facility million net available liquidity at december  million the company has certain foreign overdraft facilities which were undrawn at december  however  due to limitations on the ability to remit funds to the united states  these have been excluded in the available liquidity table above 
form k the table below summarizes certain measures of liquidity and capital expenditures  as well as the company s sources of capital from internal and external sources  for the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources financial measure in thousands cash and equivalents  at december working capital  at december cash flow from operating activities cash flow used in investing activities cash flow from financing activities capital expenditures including capital leases cash paid for interest net cash provided by operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the twelve months ended december  these amounts result from the company s operating results adjusted by changes in working capital and depreciation 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher activity levels and improved operating results 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december  and million for the twelve months ended december  these amounts primarily represent capital expenditures made during the respective twelve month period 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of reduced purchases of seismic data acquisition equipment from net cash provided by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the twelve months ended december  these totals represent the net proceeds and net payments from the company s debt and equity transactions 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to fewer funds raised in as compared to preferred stock on july   a related party of the company purchased  shares of series b senior convertible preferred stock  par value series b preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of geokinetics common stock for net proceeds of million  which will be used to execute the company s growth strategy of upgrading equipment and expanding crew capacity around the world 
revolving credit facilities on june   the company and four of its subsidiaries collectively  the borrowers completed the closing of a credit facility under the terms of a revolving credit  term loan and security agreement collectively  the credit agreement dated as of june  with pnc bank  national association pnc  as lender 
the borrowers pledged as security the assets of the company to pnc 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants limiting the company s ability to incur additional debt and purchase additional assets 
on september   the million term credit facility had a balance of million outstanding and was fully paid off and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
this credit agreement has been amended several times to among other things increase the revolving credit and expenditures facilities 
the financial covenants for the credit facility include the following the company must maintain i net worth defined as assets less liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america of not less than million and ii a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to other covenants include no mergers or sale of assets without reinvestment  no conflicting liens on the collateral  no guarantees of other indebtedness  investments are permitted as to only specified forms of investments  capital expenditures are limited  no dividends other than dividends on preferred stock  no additional indebtedness except as permitted by the credit facility  no changes in business activities  no changes in constituent documents  no prepayment of debt except under certain circumstances  no material adverse change  and no change of control 
form k the amount available to borrow under the revolver is dependent upon the calculation of a monthly borrowing base that is composed of eligible accounts receivables and eligible fixed assets 
the borrowing base can fluctuate from time to time due to fluctuations in accounts receivable balances 
additionally  a portion of the borrowing base is composed of eligible fixed assets 
based on the company s borrowing base at december   the company had available credit under this facility of million reduced by standby letters of credit totaling million issued by pnc under the revolver 
at december   the company had a balance of million drawn under the revolver 
amounts available to be drawn under the revolver are subject to borrowing base limitations  therefore  the company may not always have access to the maximum amount 
the rate of the pnc facility is currently the prime rate plus 
the company further amended the credit agreement with pnc on february  among other things  the amended agreement increased the company s borrowing base that can come from eligible fixed assets to million and deferred any reductions to this new amount until june   at which time  the amount of the borrowing base that can come from eligible fixed assets will be reduced by million per month until maturity 
once started  the reduction will affect only the amount of the borrowing base that can come from eligible fixed assets and will not reduce the overall amount of the revolver 
based on the current borrowing base calculation  the company has immediate access to the maximum availability of million 
capital lease obligations in july  geokinetics usa  inc formerly quantum geophysical  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  entered into an equipment lease agreement with cit group equipment financing  inc cit 
the parties entered into the lease with respect to the purchase of seismic data acquisition equipment 
the term of the lease is three years  with a purchase option at the expiration of the lease term 
the original amount of the lease was approximately million and monthly payments were approximately  in august  the company had reduced the principal amount of this lease to million and refinanced this equipment lease with a new facility from cit in the amount million at a rate of per annum for months yielding million of new funds to the company 
the unpaid balance of this lease as of december  was approximately million 
on november   the company entered into an additional capital lease facility with cit equipment financing  inc with a commitment of million 
the interest rate was based on the three or four year swap rate reported by the federal reserve plus basis points or 
initially  the company executed four equipment schedules totaling approximately million with an interest rate of and monthly payments totaling approximately million 
on december   the company executed an additional four equipment schedules totaling million with an interest rate of and monthly payments totaling approximately million 
the balance at december  was million 
in april  the company entered into an additional equipment lease agreement with cit for up to million to finance seismic equipment purchases for its shallow water ocean bottom cable obc operations in australia 
as of december   the company executed two equipment schedules totaling approximately million with an interest rate ranging from to and monthly payments totaling approximately million 
the unpaid balance of these schedules at december  was approximately million 
the equipment securing this lease has moved to angola  which required a waiver to move the equipment out of australia 
the current waiver expires on april  at this time  the company does not know whether it will receive an extension on this waiver 
if the waiver is not extended  the company may have to put in place a standby letter of credit estimated at approximately million in order for the equipment to remain outside of australian waters 
other from time to time  the company enters into vendor financing arrangements to purchase certain equipment 
the equipment purchased from these vendors is paid over a period of time 
the total balance of vendor financing arrangements at december  was approximately million 
the company maintains various foreign bank overdraft facilities used to fund short term working capital needs 
at december   there were no outstanding balances under these facilities and the company had approximately million of availability 
form k the company has made  and expects to continue to make  significant investments in capital expenditures 
in  the company incurred million in capital expenditures 
based on current plans  the company anticipates making capital expenditures of million for  including million in the first half of  subject to compliance with debt covenants and operational requirements 
in addition  the company s board of directors approved a million investment in an interest in data that the company will retain in conjunction with a data acquisition survey that will be completed by the company 
the data will be acquired in the united states and co owned by the company and its customer 
the company expects that license revenues already committed will be sufficient to cover the company s share of cash costs for data acquisition 
the company believes that its current cash balances and anticipated cash flow from its seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing operations  combined with available debt financing  will provide sufficient liquidity to continue operations throughout should the company s current sources of liquidity not meet its operating requirements  the company would be forced to seek outside sources of capital to meet its operating and capital requirements and or curtail its capital expenditure program 
critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of geokinetics inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
use of estimates in preparing consolidated financial statements management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us those estimates and assumptions are included in the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to accounting for contracts in process  evaluating the outcome of uncertainties involving claims against or on behalf of the company  determining useful lives for depreciation and amortization purposes  cash flow projections and fair values used in the determination of asset impairment 
while management believes current estimates are reasonable and appropriate  actual results could differ materially from current estimates 
fair values of financial instruments effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
as it relates to financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principals and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three board levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas no 
are described below level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg  interest rates  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
level inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
form k financial instruments financial instruments are recorded at fair values 
the reported fair values for financial instruments that use level and level inputs to determine fair value are based on a variety of factors and assumptions 
accordingly  certain fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized as of december  or that will be realized in the future and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual sale or settlement 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable and short term debt approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments 
the carrying amount of long term debt approximates fair value 
due to the recent market events and the recent trading range of the company s common stock  the company believes the fair value of its preferred stock to be approximately million 
revenue recognition the company s services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
customer contracts for services vary in terms and conditions 
contracts are either turnkey or term agreements or a combination of the two 
under turnkey agreements or the turnkey portions thereof  the company recognizes revenue based upon output measures as work is performed 
this method requires that the company recognize revenue based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as square miles or linear kilometers shot 
with respect to those contracts where the customer pays separately for the mobilization of equipment  the company recognizes such mobilization fees as revenue during the performance of the seismic data acquisition  using the same performance method as for the acquisition work 
the company also receives revenue for certain third party charges under the terms of the service contracts 
the company records amounts billed to customers in revenue as the gross amount including third party charges  if applicable  that are paid by the customer 
the company s turnkey or term contracts generally do not contain cancellation provisions that would prevent the company from being compensated for work performed prior to cancellation due to milestones not being met or work not being performed within a particular timeframe 
in some instances  customers are billed in advance of work performed and the company recognizes the advance billing as deferred revenue 
as a result of the nature of the company s services  the company from time to time engages with customers in renegotiations or revisions of service contracts  which represent contingent revenues that are recognized only when the amounts have been received or awarded 
deferred revenue consists primarily of customer payments made in advance of work done  milestone billings and mobilization revenue  amortized over the term of the related contract 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the lesser of the lease term  as applicable 
repairs and maintenance  which are not considered betterments and do not extend the useful life of property  are charged to expense as incurred 
when property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of  the asset and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds either the fair value or the estimated discounted cash flows of the assets  whichever is more readily measurable 
at december  and  management deemed no such assets were impaired 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired net of the fair value of liabilities assumed 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that intangible assets with indefinite lives  including goodwill  be evaluated on an annual basis for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change which could potentially result in an impairment 
form k the impairment test requires the allocation of goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value including goodwill  then goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value and the amount of any write down is reflected in operations 
all of the company s goodwill is related to its data acquisition segment 
while this segment consists of various geographical markets  the company has concluded that it has only one reporting unit for purposes of the impairment test 
the company performs impairment tests on the carrying value of its goodwill on an annual basis as of december st 
historically  the company has used the income approach or the discounted cash flow method  which focuses on expected cash flows 
in applying this approach  the expected cash flow is projected based on assumptions regarding revenues  direct costs  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  applicable income taxes  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for a finite period of years  which was five years in the company s test 
the projected cash flows and the terminal value  which is an estimate of the value at the end of the finite period and assumes a long term growth rate  are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of the value of the reporting unit 
for the company s annual assessment as of december   due to the economic conditions affecting the industry  the company also utilized the subject company valuation method  which makes a comparison of the company s projections to reasonably similar publicly traded companies 
in weighting the results of the various valuation approaches  the company placed more emphasis on the income approach 
for the years ended december  and  the company s annual impairment test indicated the fair value of its reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the carrying amount 
intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also reviewed for impairment at least annually 
no impairment was deemed necessary 
at december  and  intangible assets were presented at a net book value of approximately million and million with accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively
