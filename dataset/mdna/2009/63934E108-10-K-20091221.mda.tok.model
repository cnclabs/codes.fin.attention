in addition  this item provides information about our business segments and how the results of those segments impact our financial condition and results of operations as a whole 
executive summary for fiscal years and  we have remained profitable despite consecutive declines in our chargeouts and shipments in our truck and engine segments while executing our plans to maintain our liquidity  normalize our capital structure  and developed effective internal control over financial reporting 
we weathered the economic recession  which resulted in the lowest traditional truck industry volumes in years in our truck segment 
in addition  in  our engine segment began to wind down our north american sales agreement with ford 
we believe our actions over the past two years have positioned us for continued profitability over the next several years 
one of our more significant actions resulted in the growth of our military business improving our profitability 
we expect to be a challenging year for earnings which will be driven primarily by the strength of an economic recovery in our traditional truck markets and continued improvements to our cost structure 
the following table presents our consolidated net income loss driven primarily by truck and engine segments  our two largest segments  with segment sales  truck backlog  truck chargeouts and engine shipments

change change change change in millions  except units and change net income loss nm truck chargeouts truck order backlogs truck segment sales engine shipments engine segment sales our truck segment sales were impacted by the change in mix associated with military sales and the economic recession in our primary commercial markets in the us and canada 
we began chargeouts of mraps to the us military in and delivered all existing orders in our mix of military sales has changed from the higher content  higher priced mraps to lower content  lower priced  tactical wheeled and militarized commercial vehicles 
our engine segment sales have continued to decline due to a reduction in demand for our diesel engines from ford and our customers in south america as well as lower engine requirements by our truck segment 
our exclusive agreement to supply ford diesel engines for their f series and e series vehicles in north america will conclude on december  however  we will continue to provide ford with service parts related to our diesel engines 
we expect to partially offset the loss of the ford north american diesel engine supply agreement with new customers for our south american engine subsidiary 
in addition  we expect increased sales in to our truck segment as chargeouts recover from historic lows and increased use of our maxxforce and engines in our class trucks 

table of contents one significant factor impacting our net income in and was our sales to the us military of billion and billion  respectively  partially offsetting lower sales from our commercial products 
in  we fulfilled our existing orders for mraps to the us military and increased delivery of lower content militarized commercial trucks to the us and north atlantic treaty organization nato allies as well as sales of proprietary parts to the us military 
our reported net income for included immaterial out of period adjustments as described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other notable components of our net income loss over the past three years are presented in the table below

as a result  we received cash  released certain potential liabilities and increased equity ownership in our joint ventures with ford which was partially offset with related charges due to our commitment to cease our manufacturing operations at our indianapolis engine locations and associated supplier contract settlements 
in  we recorded other charges related to permanently reduced ford engine volumes in north america 
impairment of property  plant and equipment in  changes in our truck segment business resulted in impairments of certain assets 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to streamline our manufacturing footprint in an effort to optimize our cost structure 
a result of any decision could trigger additional impairments including  without limitation  charges related to our chatham facility 
in  we recognized impairment charges for certain assets in our engine segment as a result of permanently reduced ford engine volumes in north america 
extraordinary gain from the monaco acquisition we acquired certain assets of former recreational vehicle manufacturer monaco coach corporation which was accounted for as a business combination in the fair value of the assets acquired from monaco coach corporation exceeded the purchase price resulting in an extraordinary gain 
defined benefits expense income defined benefits expense is a net periodic cost that is generally made up of the accrual of benefits earned during the year and the related provisions resulting from changes in economic conditions that affect how the benefits will be paid 
the net periodic cost in a given year is generally derived from the measurement of plan assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the year 
the increase in costs in versus resulted from a significant decline in the funded status between the october   and october   measurement dates 
this decline in funded status caused a significant increase in our required provision in versus due to the gap between the expected returns on the lower plan asset base and the interest cost on the plan obligations 
while we expect our net periodic costs from defined benefit plans in to be lower than  the gap between expected returns on plan assets and interest cost on the plan obligations remains 

table of contents we also recognized additional costs of approximately million during related to curtailments and contractual termination benefits compared to a net gain of million in related to the settlement and curtailment of uaw benefit plan and other unrelated curtailments and contractual termination benefits 
write off of debt issuance cost in  we refinanced certain manufacturing operations debt of billion with an original maturity in and recognized a write off of debt issuance cost of million 
in  we entered into a billion term loan facility and synthetic revolving facility and borrowed an aggregate amount of billion to repay all amounts outstanding under the prior three year billion unsecured facility due in the repayment of the billion unsecured facility due in resulted in a write off of debt issuance cost of million in professional fees related to our financial filings the professional fees related to our financial filings have continued to decline as we normalized our financial reporting process and replaced consultants with company personnel 
in addition  our professional fees have declined as prior years included preparation and audit of multiple periods  and we have made numerous improvements in our accounting and control environments 
we expect continued reductions at a slower rate in the future as we continue to improve our systems 
our consolidated results of operations  including diluted earnings loss per share  for the years ended october  are as follows in millions  except per share data sales and revenues  net costs of products sold restructuring charges impairment of property and equipment selling  general and administrative expenses engineering and product development costs interest expense other income expenses  net total costs and expenses equity in income of non consolidated affiliates income loss before income tax  minority interest  and extraordinary gain income tax expense income loss before minority interest and extraordinary gain minority interest in net income of subsidiaries  net of tax income loss before extraordinary gain extraordinary gain  net of tax net income loss diluted earnings per share income loss before extraordinary gain extraordinary gain  net of tax net income loss 
table of contents key trends and business outlook certain factors have affected our results of operations for as compared to and some of these factors are as follows global economy the global economy  and in particular the economies in the us and brazil markets  are showing signs of recovery  and the related financial markets have stabilized 
the impact of the economic recession in and financial turmoil in on the global markets pose a continued risk as customers may postpone spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news and or declines in income or asset values 
lower demand for our customers products or services could also have a material negative effect on the demand for our products 
in addition  there could be exposure related to the financial viability of certain key third party suppliers  some of which are our sole source for particular components 
lower expectations of growth and profitability have resulted in impairments of long lived assets and we could continue to experience pressure on the carrying values if conditions persist for an extended period of time 
traditional truck market the traditional truck markets in which we compete are typically cyclical in nature and are strongly influenced by macro economic factors such as industrial production  demand for durable goods  capital spending  oil prices and consumer confidence 
the traditional truck industry retail deliveries were  in   in  and  in we expect the traditional truck industry retail deliveries in the range of  to  during military sales in  we continued to leverage existing products and plants to meet the urgent demand of the us military 
our us military sales were billion in  billion in and million in and consisted of mrap vehicle chargeouts  deliveries of lower content militarized commercial trucks to the us and nato allies and sales of parts and services to the us military 
we completed our delivery of all existing mrap orders to the us military in and have not received any substantial additional mrap orders 
we continue to expect that over the long term our military business will generate approximately billion in annual sales 
worldwide engine unit sales our worldwide engine unit sales are impacted primarily by sales to ford  north america truck demand and sales in south america  our largest engine market outside of the north american market 
these markets are impacted by consumer demand for products that use our engines as well as macro economic factors such as oil prices and construction activity 
our worldwide engine unit sales were  in   in  and  in we settled our legal dispute with ford in  and we will continue our north american supply agreement for diesel engines with ford through december  as a result  we expect our north american unit sales to ford to be minimal 
we expect our worldwide engine unit sales to be primarily to our truck segment in north america and to external customers of our subsidiary in south america 
changes in credit markets during  the traditional truck industry continued to be under pressure from credit tightening and general economic weakness 
credit spreads  which generally represent the default risk component above the base interest rate that a lender charges its customer  remain at historically high levels but are currently lower than the unprecedented levels seen at the end of and early in  credit spreads are expected to decrease slightly from levels but remain higher than historical norms 
as a result  our financial services segment future borrowings could be more costly than in the past 
changes in capital structure in october  we completed the sale of billion aggregate principle amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due the proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the billion loan facility due in the impact of issuing the new debt will increase our interest expense in versus the convertible debt will impact our calculation of diluted earnings per share when our stock price exceeds during the reporting period 
emissions standards technology we have chosen advanced exhaust gas recirculation egr 
table of contents combined with other technologies to meet the emissions standards 
our emissions strategy places the burden and responsibility of meeting the emissions standards on us versus the customer 
we believe that our customer friendly solution provides our products with a significant competitive advantage in north america  because  most truck and engine manufacturers have chosen urea based scr as the solution to meet emission standards 
certain professional fees we incurred elevated levels of professional  legal and consulting fees in and related to assistance in preparing our consolidated financial statements  documenting and performing an assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and internal investigations related to our restatement of sec filings 
however  in we had a significant reduction in professional expenses as we have become a current sec filer and our control environment has improved 
we completed our internal investigations  reached a tentative agreement with the investigative staff of the sec and are awaiting mutual agreement on specific language of the orders and final approval by the sec 
we expect our professional fees associated with sec filings to continue to trend slightly lower in the primary drivers of our expected improvement are due to sustaining the improvements in our accounting and control environment 
the table below summarizes the costs incurred for each year and in total for the three year period ended october  total in millions professional fees associated with the audit and the re audit of periods prior to professional fees associated with the    and audits professional  consulting  and legal fees related to preparation of our public filing documents professional fees associated with documentation and assessment of internal control over financial reporting total customer and transportation industry consolidations various transportation companies have been either acquired  merged to form combined operating entities or ceased operations 
although we are unable to determine the impact this industry consolidation will have with regard to future purchases or pricing of our trucks  engines and parts  we have experienced that some of these newly combined entities have contributed to lower demand and increased purchasing power by some of our customers 
steel and other commodities generally  we have been able to mitigate the effects of steel and other commodity cost increases from to via a combination of design changes  material substitution  resourcing  global sourcing efforts and pricing performance 
in addition  although the terms of supplier contracts and special pricing arrangements can vary  generally a time lag exists between when our suppliers incur increased costs and when these costs are passed on to us as well as when we might recover them through increased pricing 
this time lag can span several quarters or years  depending on the specific situation 
more recent trends indicate the cost pressures from the majority of our steel and commodity inputs have not only ceased  but reversed somewhat 
however  we have experienced some commodity price increases versus the overall industry decline as our prior actions to avoid the significant price increases have resulted in temporarily having slightly higher costs than the industry 
cost increases related to steel  precious metals  resins and petroleum products totaled approximately million  million and million  for  and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year

prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change in methodology 
sales and revenues  net decreased within the truck segment by in as compared to the primary driver of the decrease in net sales and revenues were lower us military sales of billion and a weak north american truck market 
truck segment sales to the us military were billion in and billion in we completed 
table of contents the deliveries of existing mrap orders in and increased sales of lower content and lower priced military units to the us military and nato allies 
we experienced lower overall commercial chargeouts as a result of the weakness in the overall traditional industry which more than offset the higher chargeouts from our class heavy trucks as a result of the success of our prostar trucks 
we believe that with our us epa emissions strategy and our customer focused approach will continue to improve our chargeouts resulting in higher sales 
our row sales were significantly affected in as we faced the worst global recession since the great depression 
our engine segment was our second largest segment in net sales and revenues 
total units shipped by this segment were down  units or in as compared to our units shipped to ford in north america decreased by  units or compared to the prior year as ford reduced its purchasing requirements 
our south american sales were down  units or in as compared to the reduction in units shipped to ford in north america was further exacerbated by the worst traditional north american truck market since as a result of the world wide recession 
our north american exclusive production of diesel engines for the ford f series and e series will end on december   and will significantly reduce our engine shipments in our fiscal year 
we expect to partially offset the loss of the ford north american exclusive agreement with new customer sales from south america 
in addition  we expect a recovery of our traditional truck markets in coinciding with an increase in use of our maxxforce and engines 
our parts segment sales increase was driven by us mrap service parts and other military service parts orders  which more than offset the adverse impacts of the economic recession 
we have experienced a sales decline in our commercial products consistent with much lower service repair demand as a result of poor economic conditions 
the lower tonnage hauled by freight carriers and eroding profitability has reduced our customers ability to buy service parts 
our financial services segment revenues decreased reflecting the decline in average finance receivables of million in as compared to the same period in  partially offset by an increase in securitization income driven by a decrease in discount rates 
the decline in average finance receivable balances reflect customer payments and a reduction in new financing opportunities resulting from fewer sales of vehicles and components due to reduced customer demand  all driven by the difficult economic environment in the us and mexico markets 
costs and expenses change change in millions  except change costs of products sold  excluding items presented separately below postretirement benefits expense allocated to cost of products sold product warranty costs total costs of products sold costs of products sold decreased in as compared to  as a result of lower chargeouts and associated material purchases of commercial trucks and change in mix of military products from higher content mraps to lower content military trucks 
in addition  costs of products sold further decreased due to lower diesel engines and service parts deliveries to the commercial market that were offset partially by million of other ford related charges and higher direct material commodity costs 
we were not able to fully capitalize on some of the recent commodity cost savings experienced by the industry due to pre existing contractual obligations 
our efforts delayed and reduced the higher expense that the industry experienced in prior years 
we continued our 
table of contents efforts to contain direct material costs through a combination of design changes  material substitution  alternate supplier resourcing  global sourcing  and price performance to mitigate direct material price increases we have experienced 
costs related to steel  precious metals  resins and petroleum products increased by million in compared to an increase of million in the decrease in product warranty costs  including extended warranty program costs and net of vendor recoveries product warranty costs compared to was driven primarily by a reversal of million of product warranty costs related to the ford settlement 
in addition  the decrease in product warranty costs were the result of lower volumes and lower claims out of the contractual obligation period offset partially by adjustments to warranty accruals for changes in our estimates of warranty costs for products sold in prior years pre existing warranty of million and higher costs per unit 
excluding the reversal of the warranty costs related to the ford settlement  the increase in product warranty costs were due to higher pre existing warranty adjustments and higher costs per unit 
the higher pre existing warranty adjustments and higher cost per unit were primarily driven by us epa regulations  which have resulted in rapid product development cycles and have included significant changes from previous engine models 
the us epa regulations required new emission compliant products which are more complex and contain higher material costs 
consequently  repair costs have exceeded those that we have historically experienced 
in the past  our engines typically had a longer model lifecycle that afforded us the opportunity to refine both the design and manufacturing of the product to reduce both the volume and the severity of warranty claims 
restructuring charges relate to restructuring activities at our indianapolis engine plant iep and indianapolis casting corporation icc locations 
in  due to significant reductions from ford we changed our business strategy regarding our manufacturing activities in our iep and icc locations while maintaining certain quality control and manufacturing engineering services 
we recognized million of restructuring charges for contractual obligations  personnel costs for employee termination and related benefits  charges for postretirement contractual terminations benefits and a plan curtailment 
for more information  see note  ford settlement and related charges  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in  impairment of property and equipment was million related to changes in our business and volumes at the chatham and conway locations in our truck segment

total selling  general and administrative expenses the decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to were driven by declines in our professional consulting and auditing fees related to sec filings and from cost reduction measures actively pursued this year  which were offset partially by an increase in our postretirement benefits expense 
we 
table of contents have had a significant reduction in professional expenses as we have become a current sec filer and have made improvements in our accounting and control environment 
see the discussion later in this section and in note  postretirement benefits  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the explanation of the increase in postretirement benefits expense 
dealcor expenses declined in following the sale of certain company owned dealerships and lower costs at our remaining locations 
the expense for incentive compensation and profit sharing reflects projected and actual performance versus our management incentive targets 
the decline in the provision for doubtful accounts was a result of the lower average finance receivable balances partially offset by an increase in our allowance ratio to outstanding finance receivables and loss reserves for specific customers as compared to in  repossessions and delinquencies began to decline due to the stabilization of the truck industry and the general economy 
finally  the personnel costs for employee terminations in reflect a reduction in salaried and management personnel to align with current market conditions 
engineering and product development costs increased slightly in as compared to such costs were incurred by our truck and engine segments for product innovation and manufacturing cost reductions  and to provide our customers with product and fuel efficiencies 
engineering and product development costs incurred at the truck segment were million in  which compares to million incurred in  and relates primarily to the further development of various military truck applications and emission compliant products 
engineering and product development costs incurred at our engine segment were million in  which compares to million in this increase is a result of the efforts to develop our maxxforce engine and improving our egr and other technology to meet us epa emission regulations

our engine segment was our second largest segment in net sales and revenues with billion in and billion in units shipped to ford in north america significantly decreased by  units or compared to the prior year due to a reduction in ford s purchasing requirements 
there was a decrease in the relative ratio of diesel to gas trucks produced in the heavy duty pickup truck market to in from in  which contributed to the lowered ford demand for our engines 
the decline in units shipped to ford in north america was partially offset by increases in non ford oem sales and intersegment sales to the truck segment for sales to the us military 

table of contents our parts segment recorded net sales of billion in and billion in for growth of 
this growth was primarily due to our expansion into the military business  as well as our continued focus on expansion outside of our commercial traditional markets 
in the traditional markets  we were able to realize slight growth despite the challenging economy and we continue to successfully maintain our presence through expansion into additional product lines and enhancement of our relationship with new and current fleets

the increase in provision for doubtful accounts is due to an increase in repossessions and delinquencies coupled with continued weakness in our receivables portfolio 
we provide for certain losses related to the potential repossession and liquidation of collateral underlying finance receivables with dealers and retail customers 
finally  increases in stock based compensation expense versus prior year resulted from the issuance of restricted stock during the fourth quarter of a significant portion of the awards were granted to retirement eligible employees resulting in immediate recognition of a substantial portion of those costs consistent with relevant accounting literature 
engineering and product development costs declined slightly in as compared to engineering and product development costs were primarily incurred by our truck and engine segments for innovation and cost reduction  and to provide our customers with product and fuel efficiencies 
engineering and product development costs incurred at the truck segment were million in  which compares to the million incurred in  and relates primarily to the further development of our prostar class long haul truck

our truck segment sales are primarily driven by chargeouts 
our chargeouts are primarily driven by customer purchase of our products 
net orders are a precursor to potential chargeouts and market share trends 
order backlogs are orders outstanding at the end of the period waiting to be built and can be cancelled by the customer

our focus on market share is concentrated  in general  on the performance of the individual classes that comprise our traditional truck markets  rather than the total 
the consolidated traditional truck market share figure  which is subject to the effects of product mix  is a less meaningful metric for us to determine overall relative competitive performance than it may be for others in our industry 
our school buses  class and medium trucks  and combined class trucks classes all led their markets with the greatest retail market share in each of their classes by brand 
our strategy is to maintain and grow these market share positions 
we believe that our customer friendly emissions strategy will provide us with a competitive advantage and will allow us to improve our market share in our leading market share in school buses is attributable to our brand strength  distribution strategy and on going efforts to further engage and support our dealer and customer networks 
the fluctuation in our market share for school buses was driven by the timing of purchases by our major customers 
the slight decline in our market share for the class and medium trucks was attributable to aggressive pricing incentives and discount programs instituted by our competitors and new entrants into this class 
we demonstrated our continued long term commitment to the class heavy truck market through our launch of the prostar and lonestar class long haul trucks 
our class heavy truck market share increased as the acceptance of our prostar grew in the class heavy truck market 
our new prostar products are distinctive and demonstrate better fuel efficiency and ease of maintenance compared to our competitors 
we increased our leading market share in the class severe service trucks primarily with us military deliveries 
truck segment net orders we define orders as written commitments from customers and dealers to purchase trucks 
orders do not represent guarantees of purchases by customers or dealers and are subject to cancellation 
orders shown are net orders and thus represent new orders received during the indicated time period less cancellations of orders made during the same time period 
orders may be either sold orders which will be built for specific customers directly or through our dealer networks or stock orders which will generally be built for dealers for eventual sale to customers 
all orders are placed with our assembly plants for destinations anywhere in the world and include trucks  buses  and military tactical vehicles 
we have historically had an increase in net orders for stock inventory from our dealers at the end of the year due to a combination of demand or incentives to the dealers 
increases in stock orders typically translate to higher chargeouts for our truck segment and increased dealer inventory

our intent is to convert our interest rate exposure related to our secured borrowings from a floating rate to a fixed rate in order to better match the cash flows of our fixed rate finance receivables so that the net margin spread over the life of the securitization is more predictable 
this is accomplished by funding fixed rate receivables utilizing a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt and derivative financial instruments to convert variable rate debt to fixed 
none of our derivatives qualified for hedge accounting treatment in   or  accordingly we apply mark to market accounting and recognize the resulting non cash charges as an element of interest expense 
the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on expected future cash flows and is subject to market risk  and subject to change in the credit spread of the counter parties  as changes in market conditions or interest rates impact the value of the instruments

it is our opinion that  in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands  current and forecasted cash flow from our manufacturing operations  financial services operations  and financing capacity will provide sufficient funds to meet anticipated operating requirements  capital expenditures  equity investments  and strategic acquisitions 
we also believe that collections on the outstanding receivables portfolios as well as funds available from various funding sources will permit the financial services operations to meet the financing requirements of our dealers and retail customers 
the manufacturing operations are generally able to access sufficient sources of financing to support our business plan

during  nic made capital contributions totaling million to nfc to ensure compliance with this covenant 
derivative instruments we use derivative financial instruments as part of our overall interest rate  foreign currency  and commodity risk management strategies to reduce our interest rate exposure  to potentially increase the return on invested funds  to reduce exchange rate risk for transactional exposures denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  and to minimize commodity price volatility 
from time to time  we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the value of our foreign currency cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the value of sales made and costs incurred in currencies other than the functional currency 
from time to time we also use commodity forward contracts to manage variability related to exposure to certain commodity price risk 
in connection with the sale of the convertible notes  the company purchased call options for million 
the call options are intended to minimize share dilution associated with the convertible notes 
as the call options and warrants are indexed to our common stock we recognized them in permanent equity in additional paid in capital  and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value as long as the instruments remain classified as equity 
we generally do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and did not during the years ended october   or none of our derivatives qualified for hedge accounting treatment in   or for derivative contracts  collateral is generally not required of the counter parties or of the company 
we manage exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with various major financial institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counter parties 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties is limited to only those gains that have been recorded  but have not yet been received in cash payment 
at october  and  our exposure to credit loss was million and million  respectively 
our financial services operations manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by limiting the amount of fixed rate assets funded with variable rate debt 
this is accomplished by funding fixed rate receivables utilizing a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt and derivative financial instruments to convert variable rate debt to fixed 
these derivative financial instruments may include interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  and forward contracts 
the fair value of these instruments is estimated by discounting expected future monthly settlements and is subject to market risk  as the instruments may become less valuable due to changes in market conditions or interest rates  or credit spreads of counterparties 
notional amounts of derivative financial instruments do not represent exposure to credit loss 
capital resources we expend capital to support our operating and strategic plans 
such expenditures include investments to meet regulatory and emissions requirements  maintain capital assets  develop new products or improve existing products  and to enhance capacity or productivity 
many of the associated projects have long lead times and require commitments in advance of actual spending 
business units provide their estimates of costs of capital projects  expected returns  and benefits to senior management 
those projects are evaluated from the perspective of expected return and strategic importance  with a goal to maintain the annual capital expenditure spending in the million to million range  exclusive of capital expenditures for equipment leased to others 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits generally  our pension plans are funded by contributions made by us 
our policy is to fund the pension plans in accordance with applicable us and canadian government regulations and to make additional contributions from time to time 
at october   we have met all legal funding requirements 
we contributed million and million to our pension plans in and  respectively 
in august  the pension protection act of ppa was signed into law in the us the effective date of the ppa was deferred until january  subject to a transition period 
the ppa increases the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans to of the liability and requires unfunded liabilities  or changes in unfunded liabilities  to be fully funded over a seven year period 
in  we expect to contribute million to meet the minimum required contributions for all plans 
we currently expect that from through  the company will be required to contribute at least million per year to the plans depending on asset performance and discount rates in the next several years 
current legislative proposals under consideration would change the amount of required contributions if adopted 
other postretirement benefit obligations  such as retiree medical  are primarily funded in accordance with a legal agreement the settlement agreement between us  our employees  retirees  and collective bargaining organizations  which eliminated certain benefits provided prior to that date and provided for cost sharing between us and participants in the form of premiums  co payments  and deductibles 
our contributions totaled million and million in and  respectively 
we expect to contribute million to our other post employment benefit plans during as part of the settlement agreement  a base program trust was established in june to provide a vehicle for funding the health care liability through our contributions and retiree premiums 
a separate independent retiree supplemental benefit program was also established  which included our contribution of class b common stock  originally valued at million  to potentially reduce retiree premiums  co payments  and deductibles and provide additional benefits in subsequent periods 
in addition to the base plan fund  we are contingently obligated to make profit sharing contributions to the retiree supplemental benefit trust to potentially improve upon the basic benefits provided through the base plan fund 
these profit sharing contributions are determined by means of a calculation as established through the settlement agreement 
there have been no profit sharing contributions to the retiree supplemental benefit trust during the three fiscal years ended october  the funded status of our plans is derived by subtracting the actuarially determined present value of the projected benefit obligations at year end from the end of year fair value of plan assets 
the under funded status of our pension plans increased by million during due largely to a decrease in the discount rates used to determine the present value of the projected benefit obligations pbo 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure the pbo was at october  compared to at october  the decline in the funded status due to discount rates was partially offset by better than expected asset returns during the fiscal year 
our actual return experience during was approximately for the us pension plans 
recently the investment policies were modified for each plan that maintains an asset trust 
as a result of the change  we have lowered our expectations for future returns on plan assets from to as of october  the under funded status of our health and life insurance benefits increased by million primarily due to the decrease in discount rates mentioned above 
however  the discount rate impact was mitigated by two primary factors 
first  we negotiated better pricing from our vendors on the prescription drug benefits that we provide to our retirees 
second  by moving our medicare eligible population from a fully insured medicare advantage fee for service plan to a self insured medicare advantage ppo plan  we were able to reduce the administrative costs that were previously included in our obligation 

table of contents we have collective bargaining agreements that include participation in multiemployer pension plans 
under the terms of such collective bargaining agreements  contributions are paid to the multiemployer pension plans during a union member s period of employment 
our obligations are satisfied once those contributions are paid to these plans 
a withdrawal liability may be assessed by the multiemployer pension plan if we no longer have an obligation to contribute or all covered operations at the facility cease 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into various arrangements not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
the principal off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into are guarantees and sales of receivables 
the following discussions address each of these items for the company guarantees we occasionally provide guarantees that could obligate us to make future payments if the primary entity fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
as described below  we have recognized liabilities for some of these guarantees in our consolidated balance sheets as they meet recognition and measurement provisions 
in addition to the liabilities that have been recognized as described below  we are contingently liable for other potential losses under various guarantees 
we do not believe that claims that may be made under such guarantees would have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various leases that extend through the amounts of the guarantees are estimated and recorded as liabilities as of october  our guarantees are contingent upon the fair value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term 
we obtain certain stand by letters of credit and surety bonds from third party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements 
the amount of available stand by letters of credit and surety bonds were million at october  we extend credit commitments to certain truck fleet customers  which allow them to purchase parts and services from participating dealers 
the participating dealers receive accelerated payments from us with the result that we carry the receivables and absorb the credit risk related to these customers 
at october   we have million of unused credit commitments outstanding under this program 
in addition  at october  we have entered into various purchase commitments of million and contracts that have cancellation fees of million with various expiration dates through in the ordinary course of business  we also provide routine indemnifications and other guarantees  the terms of which range in duration and often are not explicitly defined 
we do not believe these will result in claims that would have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the terms of the ford settlement require us to indemnify ford with respect to intellectual property infringement claims  if any  that are brought against ford or others that use the liter or liter engines on behalf of ford 
the maximum amount of future payments that we could potentially be required to pay under the indemnification would depend upon whether any such claims are alleged in the future and thus cannot currently be determined 
sales of receivables our financial services operations typically sell  for legal purposes  our finance receivables to third parties while continuing to service the receivables thereafter 
in these securitization transactions  we transfer receivables to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity spe 
the spe then transfers the receivables to a legally isolated 
table of contents entity that is typically a trust or a conduit  which then issues asset backed securities to investors 
for accounting purposes  our transfers of wholesale notes receivables and retail accounts receivables are treated as sales  our transfers of other receivables are treated as secured borrowings 
we record sales by removing receivables from the consolidated balance sheet and recording gains and losses in finance revenues 
we use an spe that has in place a revolving wholesale note trust  which is a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  which provides for funding of eligible wholesale notes through variable funding certificates 
the qspe owned million of wholesale notes  which includes million of receivables with dealcors  as of october  and million of wholesale notes  which includes million of receivables with dealcors and million of cash equivalents as of october  funding certificates in the total amount of million and billion respectively  as of october  and were available to fund the receivables  and the trust had million and million of outstanding borrowings as of october  and  respectively 
we carry retained interests of million and million as of october  and  respectively  in finance receivables 
in total  proceeds from the sales of wholesale notes amounted to billion  billion  and billion in   and  respectively 
we use another spe  trac  that utilizes a million conduit funding arrangement  which provides for funding of eligible accounts receivable 
the spe owned million of retail accounts and million of cash equivalents as of october   and million of retail accounts and million of cash equivalents as of october  the spe had million and million of outstanding borrowings as of october  and  respectively 
we have retained interests of million and million as of october  and  which are recorded in finance receivables 
in october  our mexican financial services operations securitized retail notes and financial leases of million 
the securitization was facilitated through off balance sheet funding facilities and qualified as a sale of financial assets

table of contents due to the uncertainty with respect to cash payments associated with the settlement of audits with taxing authorities because of existing net operating loss carry forwards  the preceding table excludes uncertain tax positions of million 
we do not expect to make significant payments of these liabilities within the next year 
we adopted guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on november  for further information  see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we are also required to fund our pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the ppa 
as such  we expect to contribute million in to meet the minimum required contributions for all plans 
we currently expect that from through  the company will be required to contribute at least million to the plans per year depending on asset performance and discount rates in the next several years 
for additional information  see note  postretirement benefits  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other information income taxes we file a consolidated us federal income tax return for nic and its eligible domestic subsidiaries 
our non us subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards 
deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is required to be established or maintained when  based on currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the guidance on accounting for income taxes provides that important factors in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized are whether there has been sufficient taxable income in recent years and whether sufficient income is expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset 
based on our review of historical operating results and future income projections and considering the uncertainty of our us and canadian financial outlook  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to realize the value of our deferred tax assets attributable to us and canadian operations 
we therefore continue to maintain a valuation allowance against such us assets  and we established a full valuation allowance against canadian tax assets in the fourth quarter of we believe that our evaluation of deferred tax assets and our maintenance of a valuation allowance against such assets involve critical accounting estimates because they are subject to  among other things  estimates of future taxable income in the us and in other non us tax jurisdictions 
these estimates are susceptible to change and dependent upon events that may or may not occur  and accordingly  our assessment of the valuation allowance is material to the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet and changes in the valuation allowance may be material to our results of operations 
we intend to continue to assess our valuation allowance in accordance with the guidance on accounting for income taxes 
on november  we adopted the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under the guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also provides guidance on de recognition and classification  and requires companies to elect and disclose their method of reporting interest and penalties on 
table of contents income taxes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense 
total interest and penalties included in income tax expense for is million 
cumulative interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheet at october  and october  are million and million  respectively 
upon adoption  we increased our liability for uncertain tax positions by million  resulting in a comparable increase to accumulated deficit 
as of october  and october   the amount of liability for uncertain tax provisions was million and million  respectively 
if these unrecognized tax benefits are recognized  million would affect our effective tax rate 
however  to the extent we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  the effect may be in the form of an increase in the deferred tax asset related to our nol carry forward  which would attract a full valuation allowance 
we believe it is probable that the liability for uncertain tax positions will decrease during the next twelve months by approximately million  due to anticipated audit settlements 
however the impact on income tax expense and cash taxes will be minimal due to available net operating loss carry forwards 
environmental matters we have been named a potentially responsible party prp  in conjunction with other parties  in a number of cases arising under an environmental protection law  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  popularly known as the superfund law 
these cases involve sites that allegedly received wastes from current or former company locations 
based on information available to us which  in most cases  consists of data related to quantities and characteristics of material generated at current or former company locations  material allegedly shipped by us to these disposal sites  as well as cost estimates from prps and or federal or state regulatory agencies for the cleanup of these sites  a reasonable estimate is calculated of our share  if any  of the probable costs and accruals are recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
these accruals are generally recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are not discounted to their present value 
we review all accruals on a regular basis and believe that  based on these calculations  our share of the potential additional costs for the cleanup of each site will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
four sites formerly owned by us  i solar turbines in san diego  california  ii the west pullman plant in chicago  illinois  iii the canton plant in canton  illinois  and iv the wisconsin steel in chicago  illinois  were identified as having soil and groundwater contamination 
two sites in sao paulo  brazil  one where we are currently operating and another where we previously had operations  were identified as having soil and groundwater contamination 
while investigations and cleanup activities continue at all sites  we believe that we have adequate accruals to cover costs to complete the cleanup of these sites 
securitization transactions we finance receivables using a process commonly known as securitization  whereby asset backed securities are sold via public offering or private placement 
in a typical securitization transaction  we transfer a pool of finance receivables to bankruptcy remote spe 
the spe then transfers the receivables to a legally isolated entity  generally a trust or a conduit  in exchange for securities of the trust which are then retained or sold into the public market or privately placed 
these securities are issued by the trust and are secured by future collections on the receivables sold to the trust 
these transactions are subject to the provisions of the guidance on accounting for transfers and servicing financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
when we securitize receivables  we may have retained interests in the receivables sold transferred 
the retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities  undivided interests in receivables and over collateralizations  restricted cash held for the benefit of the trust  and interest only strips 
our retained interests are the first to absorb any credit losses on the transferred receivables because we have the most subordinated interests in the trust  including subordinated securities  the right to receive excess spread interest only strip  and 
table of contents any residual or remaining interests of the trust after all asset backed securities are repaid in full 
our exposure to credit losses on the transferred receivables is limited to our retained interests 
the spe s assets are available to satisfy the creditors claims against the assets prior to such assets becoming available for the spe s own uses or the uses of our affiliated companies 
since the transfer constitutes a legal sale  we are under no obligation to repurchase any transferred receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default 
we are not responsible for credit losses on transferred receivables other than through our ownership of the lowest tranches in the securitization structures 
we do not guarantee any securities issued by trusts 
we  as seller and the servicer of the finance receivables  are obligated to provide certain representations and warranties regarding the receivables 
should any of the receivables fail to meet these representations and warranties  we  as servicer  are required to repurchase the receivables 
most of our retail notes and finance leases securitization arrangements do not qualify for sales accounting treatment under the guidance on accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
as a result  such sold receivables and associated secured borrowings are included on the consolidated balance sheet and no gain or loss is recognized for these transactions 
for those that do qualify under the accounting guidance  gains or losses are reported in finance revenues 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and make judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
our assumptions  estimates  and judgments are based on historical experience  current trends  and other factors we believe are relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and should be reviewed in connection with the following discussion 
we believe that the following policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported results as they require us to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
in determining whether an estimate is critical  we consider if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 
the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide pension and other postretirement benefits to a substantial portion of our employees  former employees  and their beneficiaries 
the assets  liabilities  and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  expected return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates  rate of compensation increases  and other factors including management s plans regarding plant rationalization activities 
changes to our business environment could result in changes to the assumptions  the effects of which could be material 
plant rationalization activities impact the determination of whether a plan curtailment or settlement has occurred 
key considerations include  but are not limited to  expected future service credit  the remaining years of recall rights of the workforce  and the extent to which minimum service requirements in the case of healthcare benefits have been met 
the discount rates are obtained by matching the anticipated future benefit payments for the plans to the citigroup yield curve to establish a weighted average discount rate for each plan 

table of contents health care cost trend rates are developed based upon historical retiree cost trend data  short term health care outlook  and industry benchmarks and surveys 
the inflation assumptions used are based upon both our specific trends and nationally expected trends 
the expected return on plan assets is derived from historical plan returns  expected long term performance of asset classes  asset allocations  input from an external pension investment advisor  and risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy 
the focus is on long term trends and provides for the consideration for recent plan performance 
retirement rates are based upon actual and projected plan experience 
mortality rates are developed from actual and projected plan experience 
the rate of compensation increase reflects our long term actual experience and our projected future increases including contractually agreed upon wage rate increases for represented employees 
the sensitivities stated below are based upon changing one assumption at a time  but often economic factors impact multiple assumptions simultaneously 
october  expense obligations pension opeb pension opeb in millions discount rate increase of decrease of expected return on assets increase of n a n a decrease of n a n a allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts for finance receivables is established through a charge to the provision for credit losses 
the allowance is an estimate of the amount required to absorb probable losses on the existing portfolio of finance receivables that may become uncollectible 
finance receivables are charged off to the allowance for losses when amounts due from the customers are determined to be uncollectible 
the estimate of the required allowance is based upon three factors a historical component based upon a weighted average of actual loss experience from the most recent three years  a qualitative component based upon current economic and portfolio quality trends  and a specific reserve component 
the qualitative component is the result of analysis of asset quality trend statistics from the most recent four quarters 
in addition  we also analyze specific economic indicators such as tonnage  fuel prices  and gross domestic product for additional insight into the overall state of the economy and its potential impact on our portfolio 
the actual losses related to the retail notes and finance leases portfolio are also stratified by customer types to reflect the differing loss statistics for each 
to the extent that our judgments about these risk factors and conditions are not accurate  an adjustment to our allowance for losses may materially impact our results of operations or financial condition 
if we were to apply a hypothetical increase and decrease of basis points to the historical loss rate used in calculating the allowance for losses  the required allowance  as of october   would increase from million to million and decrease to million  respectively 
sales of receivables some of our securitization transactions qualify as sales 
gains or losses on sales of receivables are credited or charged to securitization income in the periods in which the sales occur 
amounts due from sales of receivables  also known as retained interests  which include interest only receivables  cash reserve accounts and subordinated 
table of contents certificates  are recorded at fair value 
the accretion of the discount related to the retained interests is recognized on an effective yield basis 
we estimate i the payment speed for the receivables sold  ii the discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows  and iii the anticipated net losses on the receivables to calculate the gain or loss 
the method for calculating the gain or loss aggregates the receivables into a homogeneous pool 
cash flow estimates are made for each securitization transaction which are based upon historical and current experience  anticipated future portfolio performance  market based discount rates and other factors 
these assumptions also impact the estimate of the fair value of the retained interests which is calculated monthly with changes in fair value included in the consolidated statements of operations 
the primary assumption used to estimate retained interests in sold receivables is the discount rate 
an immediate adverse change in the discount rate used to estimate retained interests of as of october   would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million for the year ended october  see note  fair value measurements  under notes to consolidated financial statements for information on unobservable inputs used to determine fair value 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate recovery of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income and other factors such as the taxing jurisdiction in which the asset is to be recovered 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent that  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances at october  and  aggregating billion and billion  respectively  against such assets based on our assessment of past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
of these amounts  million relate to net operating losses for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be allocated to additional paid in capital 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 
on november   we adopted the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under the guidance  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also provides guidance on de recognition and classification  and requires companies to elect and disclose their method of reporting  interest and penalties on income taxes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense 
upon adoption  we increased our liability for uncertain tax positions by million  resulting in a comparable increase to accumulated deficit 
as of october  and october   the amount of liability for uncertain tax provisions was million and million  respectively 
if these unrecognized tax benefits are recognized  million would affect our effective tax rate 
however  to the extent we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  the effect may be in the form of an increase in the 
table of contents deferred tax asset related to our nol carry forward  which would attract a full valuation allowance 
we believe it is probable that the liability for uncertain tax positions will decrease during the next twelve months by approximately million due to anticipated audit settlements 
however the impact on income tax expense and cash taxes will be minimal due to available net operating loss carry forwards 
impairment of long lived assets we test long lived assets or asset groups other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as discussed below for recoverability when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset or asset group include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
if the asset or asset group is determined to not be recoverable  an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  the truck segment recognized million and million of charges for impairments of property and equipment related to asset groups at our chatham and conway facilities  respectively 
the asset groups were reviewed for recoverability by comparing the carrying values to estimated future cash flows and those carrying values were determined to not be fully recoverable 
we utilized the cost approach and market approach to determine the fair value of assets within the asset groups 
the impairments at our chatham facility reflect a slower than expected recovery of industry volumes and the continuation of our unresolved negotiations with the caw 
the impairments at our conway facility are related to a strategic decision we made in the fourth quarter of to transfer bus production to our tulsa facility in for more information  see note  impairment of property and equipment 
our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgments in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections and assessing probability weightings to certain business scenarios 
other assets could become impaired in the future or require additional charges as a result of declines in profitability due to changes in volume  market pricing  cost  manner in which an asset is used  physical condition of an asset  laws and regulations  or the business environment 
significant adverse changes to our business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record additional impairment charges in future periods which could be material 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to the net assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the 
table of contents income approach is based on discounted cash flows which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each respective reporting unit 
in we did not recognize any material goodwill impairments  and the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their respective carrying amounts by or more 
however  we could recognize goodwill impairment charges in the future if we have declines in profitability due to changes in volume  market pricing  cost  or the business environment 
significant adverse changes to our business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record impairment charges in future periods which could be material 
indefinite lived intangible assets an intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized until its useful life is determined to be no longer be indefinite 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgment is applied when evaluating if an intangible asset has a finite useful life 
in addition  for indefinite lived intangible assets  significant judgment is applied in testing for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  and incorporating general economic and market conditions 
we could recognize impairment charges in the future as a result of declines in the fair values of our indefinite lived assets which could be material 
contingency accruals product liability lawsuits and claims we are subject to product liability lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business 
we record product liability accruals for the self insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions 
we obtain a third party actuarial analysis to assist with the determination of the expected ultimate losses for claims and consequently the related reserve on our balance sheet 
the actual settlement values of outstanding claims in the aggregate may differ from these estimates due to many circumstances including but not limited to the discovery and evolution of information related to individual claims  changes in the legal and regulatory environment  product development trends  and changes in the frequency and or severity of claims relative to historical experience 
the reserve for product liability was million as of october  and a change in claim amount would increase or decrease this accrual by million 
environmental remediation matters we are subject to claims by various governmental authorities regarding environmental remediation matters 
with regard to environmental remediation  many factors are involved including interpretations of local  state  and federal laws and regulations  and whether wastes or other hazardous material are contaminating the surrounding land or water or have the potential to cause such contamination 
as of october   we have accrued million for environmental remediation 
although we believe that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our accrual that could be material 

table of contents asbestos claims we are subject to claims related to illnesses alleged to have resulted from asbestos exposure from component parts found in older vehicles  although some claims relate to the alleged presence of asbestos in our facilities 
numerous factors including tort reform  jury awards  and the number of other solvent companies identified as co defendants will impact the number of claims filed against the company 
the estimate of the asbestos liability is subject to uncertainty 
such uncertainty includes some reliance on industry data to project the future frequency of claims received by us  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposures and the types of diseases that will ultimately manifest  and unexpected future inflationary trends 
historically  our actual damages paid out to individual claimants have not been material 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments related to asbestos related claims are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our accrual that could be material 
product warranty we record a liability for standard and extended warranty for products sold as well as for certain claims outside the contractual obligation period 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action  which generally occurs when it is announced 
when collection is reasonably assured  we also estimate and recognize the amount of warranty claim recoveries to be received from our suppliers 
product warranty estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claims 
initial warranty estimates for new model year products are based on the previous model year product s warranty experience until the product progresses through its life cycle and related claims data becomes mature 
warranty claims are influenced by factors such as new product introductions  technological developments  the competitive environment  and the costs of component parts 
recent emission standards have resulted in rapid product development cycles and have included significant changes from previous engine models 
we estimate warranty claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize warranty claims 
actual payments for warranty claims could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to the liabilities in future periods 
although we believe that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in our warranty accrual that could be material 
recently issued accounting standards accounting pronouncements issued by various standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective with respect to our consolidated financial statements are described below  together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our consolidated financial statements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance regarding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this new guidance requires companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on the estimated selling price of each deliverable  even though such deliverables are not sold separately either by the company or by other vendors 
this new guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  our effective date is november  however  early adoption is permitted 
if a company elects early adoption and the period of adoption is not the beginning of its fiscal year  the requirements must be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year 
retrospective application to prior years is permitted  but not required 
we are evaluating the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued new guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the guidance eliminates the concept of a qspe  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets  and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  and an entity s continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our effective date is november  we are evaluating the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
the guidance also amends the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
the previous guidance required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a vie only when specific events had occurred 
qspes  which were previously exempt from the application of this standard  will be subject to the provisions of this standard when it becomes effective 
the guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
this guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after november  and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period 
our effective date is november  we are evaluating the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  which provides guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
our effective date is october  we are evaluating the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued new guidance on the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement which requires issuers of convertible debt securities within its scope to separate these securities into a debt component and an equity component  resulting in the debt component being recorded at fair value without consideration given to the conversion feature 
issuance costs are also allocated between the debt and equity components 
the new guidance requires that convertible debt within its scope reflect a company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest expense is recognized 
the provisions of the new guidance are retrospective upon adoption 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
our effective date is november  the adoption of the new guidance on november  will impact the accounting treatment of the company s million  convertible senior subordinated notes due by reclassifying a portion of the original principal amount of the of the convertible notes balances to additional paid in capital representing the estimated fair value of the conversion feature as of the date of issuance and creating a discount on the convertible notes that will be amortized through interest expense over the life of the notes 
we tentatively measured the fair value of this equity feature at approximately million 
upon adoption of this new guidance  our october  consolidated balance sheet will be retroactively restated to reflect the increase to additional paid in capital and reduction in debt for the discount of approximately million 
the resulting debt discount will be amortized as interest expense and therefore reduce net income and basic and diluted earnings per share in future periods 
as a result of the short period the debt was outstanding  adoption of the new guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended october  in april  the fasb issued new guidance on the determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this new guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under the accounting guidance on goodwill and other 
table of contents intangible assets 
it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
early adoption is not permitted 
the guidance also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of useful lives for intangible assets and should be applied to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
our effective date is november  the impact of the new accounting guidance will depend on the size and nature of acquisitions on or after november  in february  the fasb issued new guidance on the effective date of previously issued guidance on fair value measurements 
the new guidance permits companies to partially defer the effective date of the previously issued guidance on fair value measurements for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
the new guidance does not permit companies to defer recognition and disclosure requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities or for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually 
we have decided to defer adoption of the guidance on fair value measurements until november  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance on noncontrolling interests that clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity 
it is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  our effective date is november  upon adoption  our minority interest will be reported as a separate component of stockholders deficit and our october  consolidated balance sheet will be retroactively restated 
as minority interest in net income of subsidiaries is already presented as a discrete line within our consolidated statements of operations  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance that substantially changes the accounting for and reporting of business combinations including i expanding the definition of a business and a business combination  ii requiring all assets and liabilities of the acquired business  including goodwill and contingent consideration to be recorded at fair value on the acquisition date  iii requiring acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs to be expensed rather than accounted for as acquisition costs  and iv requiring reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties to be recognized in earnings 
the guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  an entity may not apply the statement before that date 
our effective date is november  this statement will generally apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after that date  however  adjustments made to deferred tax asset valuation allowances arising from business combinations before the effective date are subject to the provisions of the new guidance 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
we are also exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used in our manufacturing operations 
commodity price risk related to our current commodity financial instruments are not material 
we do not hold a material portfolio of market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate market risk 
these procedures include the monitoring of our level of exposure to each market risk  the funding of variable rate receivables primarily with variable rate debt  and limiting the amount of fixed rate receivables that may be funded with floating rate debt 
these procedures also include the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations and to reduce our exposure to exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
we measure our interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
at october  and  the net fair value of our liabilities with exposure to interest rate risk was billion and billion  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in interest rates as of october  and  the fair value of these liabilities would increase by million and million  respectively 
at october  and  the net fair value of our assets with exposure to interest rate risk was billion and billion  respectively 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in interest rates as of october  and the fair value of these assets would decrease by million and million  respectively 
our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rate yield curves 
the model  therefore  does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of commodities  particularly for aluminum  copper  precious metals  resins  and steel and their impact on the acquisition cost of various parts used in our manufacturing operations 
we have been able to mitigate the effects of price increases via a combination of design changes  material substitution  resourcing  global sourcing  and price performance 
in certain cases  we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to price changes 
during we purchased approximately million of commodities subject to market risk 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in commodity pricing during we would have incurred an additional million of costs 
commodity price risk associated with our derivative position at october  and is not material to our operating results or financial position 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange fluctuations are the canadian dollar us dollar  mexican dollar us dollar and brazilian real us dollar 
at october  and  the net fair value of our liabilities with exposure to foreign currency risk was million and million  respectively 
assuming that no offsetting derivative financial instruments exist  the potential reduction in future earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be million at october  at october  and  the net fair value of our assets with exposure to foreign currency risk was million and million  respectively 
assuming that no offsetting derivative financial instruments exist  the potential reduction in future earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be million at october  for further information regarding models  assumptions and parameters related to market risk  please see note  fair value measurements  and note  financial instruments and commodity contracts  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements
